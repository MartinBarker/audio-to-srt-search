1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm gonna do it.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm gonna do it.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's up dudes.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He's closed out some of these windows.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Whoa.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Whoa.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Alright.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Important.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Very, very important for the Stream Starts.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I set up a new virtual Audio Capals thing.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And I want you guys to tell me if you can hear the music that is about to start playing.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So let me know because otherwise it'll be no sound.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So ready?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let me know if you can hear the medic music.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh yeah.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Can you guys hear that?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Good to know because that means I set the Audio Capals thing up correctly.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So that's good to know.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Loud and clear, Burger Boy.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Alright.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So tonight, first of all, happy Saturday.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hope you guys are having a fantastic Saturday.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Second of all, of course, Grandpa is tonight.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There's a lot of things going on tonight.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There's a lot of things going on in the world of Jeremy.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Did a video, doing a live stream.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Grandpa is tonight on Machinima.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A crazy stuff.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So I've been all over the place today.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Flow me.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, I, alright.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You got it.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let him explain himself.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let him explain himself.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Alright, Flow me.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You have, you have ten words to explain yourself.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Ten words.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Ten words, a less.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Alright, I'm going to get rid of that.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Two plus two is four.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Alright, so let me just, where's my phone?

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh, I always am losing my damn phone.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It always happens.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hold on.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I think it's across the room.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There it is.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hello, phone.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Alright.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, if you're watching this on YouTube, like eventually when I upload this tomorrow, if

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
you're watching this on YouTube, you go ahead and you can skip like two or three minutes

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
while I set this up.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I know I put an annotation there, but sometimes people go, whoa, when do you start?

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So go ahead and skip a couple minutes if you're watching this on the YouTube's.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Twitter.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hello, Twitter.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So yeah, team fortress two and binding of Isaac.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And you're probably wondering why am I playing that crazy ridiculous disturbing game?

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, because this DLC for coming out in like a couple days.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Alright, I want to get back into it because I love back in.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So let's see.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Streaming.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Two.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Two.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And finding of Isaac.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, come here.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
H-T-T-P.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Clones-lash-lash.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Twitch.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Twitch.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Twitch.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Twitch.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Twitch.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Twitch TV.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm not on it, but.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't ask me why I always do this on my phone.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I just don't feel like opening up another tab.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Like it's probably faster if I did it on my damn computer.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Is that.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Is that.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Alright, ready to go here in a second.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Just going to put a steam message out to the steam community.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I have to be.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, my.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh, what?

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
New name, apparently.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Massive bus accident.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is my name on here.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, that's one way to do have your name.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What are.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Massive bus accident.

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh, weird.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, why do I think that's so funny.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, screaming now.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Colors last night.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Streaming.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I actually put this here.

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, man.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you have to do a body music?

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Open now face this.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Party.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
15 minutes.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Alright, oh, God.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, no.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It is like duped and drank on my floor.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, God.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh, you know what?

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Stay in there.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Stay in there.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll deal with it later.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
God.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What a pro.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, okay.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's like a cup of milk on my floor right now.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That is not cool.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The show must go on.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's do it.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's that.

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And here's the tweet.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can't believe that.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Milk does a body good unless you dump it on your floor.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't know.

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Geez.

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
A little ways.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Is that work?

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It was fun though.

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Nice like avatar.

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Alright.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We're good to go.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We're good to go.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, okay.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Now I'm going to make the chat so I can see it.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Good Lord.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, that was not cool.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Get a server with zero people in it.

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And my TF2 server is coming along.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I know I said last week it was going to be done this week,

141
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
but it's not.

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's close though.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I have to talk to the guys at gameservers.com.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We have to have a meeting.

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Some type of meeting.

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What's up dudes?

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If you're just joining us, I just spilled a cup of milk on my floor

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and it's going to stay there until I'm done screaming.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I hope I don't ruin anything.

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If it like seeps over near my computer, that's going to be really bad.

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That might as well be like an emergency stop.

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Alright, let's go to...

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No, no two four, no dust bowl.

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We play dust bowl too much.

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
How about...

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hmm...

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm a gravel pit.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm okay with gravel pit.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's do gravel pit.

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This is the server.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ladies and gents.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Head there.

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Gravel pit.

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah, dust bowl is a little overplayed, but I love it though.

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I love dust bowl.

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's because I'm an old school TF2 player.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I haven't played since 2007.

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I remember that.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It used to only be dust bowl two four, turb on it.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Gravel pit.

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There was only like two more...

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There was only six maps when TF2 launched.

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Two four, dust bowl, gravel pit.

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Turbine, what would they have the two maps?

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What the hell would they have the two maps?

176
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Can somebody in the chat throw that out there?

177
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well and granary.

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Those are the only six that came out at release.

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Let's go below.

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Let's go attack it tonight.

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I feel like being an attacker.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hmm...

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No, we're gonna stop with medic.

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm starting with the medic.

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Alright, let's get the audio good here.

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Game audio good?

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Voice audio?

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Is it?

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We getting up a pod?

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Can I press L?

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Mission begin.

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh yeah, high five baby.

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Alright, let's push this point boys.

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If anyone wants to duel me I will accept it.

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm not gonna promise I will win the duel.

196
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's anyone watching the stream but I will try my best.

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I got you, I got you, I got you.

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Follow me, doctor!

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm gonna cover the house.

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm gonna push the cover.

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I am not.

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We need this over or what?

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Are we good?

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We're gonna get this.

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You know what?

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm gonna go.

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Not that way.

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I had to use it.

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I had to use it.

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh no.

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh no.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh, I shouldn't have left.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That was in my bad.

214
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I should have ice cream that up.

215
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh boy, I'm gonna die.

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm gonna die.

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
J.M.Z.

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Hole.

219
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We're okay.

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That guy's gonna try and shoot the window.

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We got it, we got it, we got it.

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh, even that sandwich.

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's fine, where are you?

224
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Bastard, there you are.

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We gotta get out of here, we're gonna get destroyed.

226
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Thank you for saving my life.

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't wanna say your name, Holland.

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You're very quiet.

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You're very quiet.

230
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What?

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What?

232
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What?

233
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You're not bad.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You knew I got him.

235
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Alright, let's push it.

236
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I love your outfit, man.

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I think I said this before last stream,

238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
but your outfit is unbelievable.

239
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And this is when we...

240
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm using it.

241
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You know, I'm gonna protect this guy too.

242
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Just because, for fun.

243
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh, a Turk.

244
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh, it's the guy I'm doing.

245
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, my God.

246
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's just fine.

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Get away.

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh, damn.

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I didn't even know I was the guy I was doing.

250
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I just walked up and function in the face.

251
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah, if you got a duel, throw it my way, dude.

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I will deal you.

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Absent positive elutin.

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm gonna get a...

255
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's get a...

256
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, I have to duel you.

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't even know if I have any duel.

258
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I think I gave him all the way.

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh, shh.

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
There we go again.

261
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh, give me that Uber.

262
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
We're gonna be able to push this.

263
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Right crowbar.

264
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
See what you got, baby.

265
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No, no, no.

266
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Where are you?

267
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh, no.

268
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Get out of my way.

269
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay.

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Hi guys.

271
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hello.

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Get away.

273
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh, damn it.

274
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Oh, damn it.

275
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Do you see like that whole group of people that were running off the stairs?

276
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That was terrifying.

277
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Good morning.

278
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Good morning.

279
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Good morning.

280
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
People need heels.

281
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I got you.

282
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, Burger Boy.

283
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The DUP machine.

284
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, no, no.

285
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Two were to be able to heal.

286
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I need the quick fix.

287
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, my God.

288
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
He's coming after me still.

289
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, my God.

290
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
How did he get me?

291
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Dude, that guy was like in a bubble.

292
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He was in a bubble of invincibility right there.

293
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You know, I'm going quick fix.

294
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Well, I don't even have the quick fix.

295
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
After my backpack, if we...

296
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh, no, that's right.

297
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I unboxed this strange one.

298
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, my God.

299
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I unboxed this.

300
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
How does it put it to the U-Strike?

301
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's go scout.

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I want to be able to run fast.

303
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Run, run, run, run, run.

304
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Quick fix.

305
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, yeah.

306
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Quick fix.

307
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh, you want to get him?

308
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No, no, no, kill the medic.

309
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Come here.

310
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Run to me.

311
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh, my God.

312
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, my God.

313
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh, my God.

314
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
How many hits did that take?

315
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I got to do it Ann.

316
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's push through this.

317
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Let's push through this nonsense of the equation.

318
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Quick fix.

319
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, what you know about the quick fix?

320
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Come here.

321
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Come here.

322
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh, you jumped away from me.

323
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What the hell?

324
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Holy one.

325
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Cool.

326
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Nice job, guys.

327
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Good game.

328
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Good game.

329
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Dermodil, you like the Yogs cast.

330
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't really watch it to be honest.

331
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yogs cast is kind of like a Minecraft thing, isn't it?

332
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Or at least a predominantly Minecraft?

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
See, I have no idea.

334
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This is me just.

335
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I have absolutely no idea.

336
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
They seem like nice guys.

337
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
They seem like cool guys.

338
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You know, I don't.

339
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I won't change it.

340
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I want the crit screw.

341
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I want the crit screw.

342
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Can I get it charged before?

343
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Well, I really, I don't have it at the end.

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You don't have to be honest.

345
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Oh, I can't have vibing.

346
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let's go, Virgo boy.

347
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Optimus Brogge's like standard there, like a statue.

348
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Mission begins in 10 seconds.

349
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
All right, Virgo boy, you better be ready to unleash hell on the world.

350
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
After this crit screw, I'm gonna be dying over here.

351
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
All right, Virgo boy.

352
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Watch out, Virgo boy.

353
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Hold on to this.

354
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll come back to you.

355
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Over you'll be ready.

356
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, there's Spy here.

357
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Spy, put your thing down.

358
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Am I a fan of Shibibu 2042?

359
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I love Shibibu 2142.

360
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He's like a friend of mine.

361
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
He's like a good bottom mine.

362
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You are.

363
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You are not real.

364
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Oh, he's still here.

365
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He's still alive.

366
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Me and I Shibibu 2142 are gross.

367
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm gonna get to you.

368
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Just shoot a bunch over there.

369
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh my god.

370
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Nevermind.

371
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I do know Star as well.

372
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm not as close to Star as Am Shibibu, but I know Star.

373
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Speaking of Star, we may actually be doing videos together sometimes soon.

374
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Sometimes very, very soon.

375
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He's a cool guy though.

376
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Stimid.

377
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yes, I know Stimid.

378
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Stimid is a bro.

379
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Pretty much if you can name me like a team portrait through channel, I probably know them.

380
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Like, I probably like know who they are and I've probably spoken to them.

381
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
At least once or twice.

382
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Stay alive, Derp.

383
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Do you know German 985?

384
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
No, who's that?

385
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He sounds like a real loser.

386
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Oh, Burger Boy.

387
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Get rid of this guy.

388
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
This guy.

389
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That's great.

390
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Blodges.

391
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Do you know?

392
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Is that a spy?

393
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Probably not.

394
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's a spy.

395
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What?

396
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
All right, so my brain just exploded.

397
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I walked towards that engineer, the real one.

398
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And then I turned around.

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I thought it was him again.

400
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I thought it was real, so I got fouled.

401
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's a spy.

402
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Why are we screaming?

403
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But to answer the question, Derp.

404
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes, I know most of the team portrait through channel.

405
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I don't know all of them.

406
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I mean, there are probably a few that I've never really had a conversation with or something.

407
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But for the most part, I had a conversation with all of them.

408
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I think there's a little more that's on the top of the tower.

409
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
All right, this is my...

410
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
No, it's just the dump machine, Burger Boy.

411
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
No, stay alive, dude.

412
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I got you.

413
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
The control control.

414
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Oh, the medic chain.

415
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh, my word.

416
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm getting a little bit of trouble, Erish, and be walking out that far.

417
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Oh, just give me one more.

418
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And...

419
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Should I use it?

420
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yes.

421
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Oh, everyone died.

422
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm not using it.

423
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh, crit rockets everywhere.

424
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Spiders.

425
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, I hate spiders.

426
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
They scare me.

427
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
All right, I'm gonna go to...

428
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Do I even...

429
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I don't think I even have a huntsman.

430
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
No, I don't.

431
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I think my huntsman's gone.

432
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh, forget it.

433
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Then wait, wait, wait.

434
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What the hell was that?

435
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What?

436
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What?

437
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh, hey, I'm just the floating snide-man.

438
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
There we go.

439
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That was weird.

440
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Let's go scout.

441
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
All defaults.

442
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Uh, no, I'm all right.

443
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Optimus, Bren.

444
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm cool.

445
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Not right this second.

446
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Maybe after when we, you know, when it's all said and done.

447
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But for now, I want to focus on the Zistream.

448
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Let's give you a straight-thiz, dude.

449
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah, we'll do it, thanks.

450
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You know what I want?

451
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I want a strange huntsman.

452
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh crap.

453
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You are still alive.

454
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Is there even a strange huntsman?

455
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Can you even get that?

456
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh, damn it.

457
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
They have a...

458
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
How much is a strange huntsman?

459
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
40 keys.

460
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's 40 keys for a strange huntsman.

461
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What?

462
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Oh my god.

463
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What crate do you get it in?

464
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What?

465
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
De... crate number 40?

466
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What?

467
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Wow, man.

468
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Wow, the salvage crate.

469
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh, it's just the salvage crate.

470
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
One of the rare ones.

471
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That's insane.

472
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
40 keys.

473
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
If I get a strange huntsman, I know I'm going to keep it.

474
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
That's crazy.

475
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Anybody up here?

476
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What's up, Millennium Boy?

477
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Exo Skeleton Bug Body?

478
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I just landed on his head.

479
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
No.

480
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I got blowed up.

481
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I got blowed up.

482
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Sorry, Millennium Man.

483
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah, it's going to be fun.

484
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Well, after this round, we'll change servers.

485
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't want to use the pistol.

486
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Oh, I still have to.

487
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I have the critical off.

488
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Let's put it on.

489
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah, I love all the scatterguns.

490
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Except for the Force and Nature, it's not my forte.

491
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm not a big fan of it.

492
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
See if we can't crit some people.

493
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Oh my god.

494
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
That was a deathmish.

495
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I just wanted to see how many hit markers would just pop up.

496
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
My name is like, yeah, I don't have my gateway in my backpack.

497
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I feel the option I have right now.

498
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What happened to my mad bill?

499
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh, right.

500
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I probably gave that away.

501
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah, I gave that away as well.

502
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

503
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
All right, let's close this self, boys.

504
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
10 girls potentially.

505
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
All right, I want to get that good couple kills with this thing, Jake.

506
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm thinking for Jake.

507
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
No, that's a death wish.

508
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'll go the other way.

509
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I shall go the other way.

510
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Anybody over here?

511
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm not that I can see.

512
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Anyone got to come out of this way?

513
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh god.

514
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I didn't think that guy.

515
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I didn't even see him.

516
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Run away!

517
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Oh!

518
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Oh my god.

519
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
See, getting stuck just saved my life right there.

520
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I want to get shot right in the back.

521
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I want to get shot right in my confine.

522
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh crap.

523
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh crap.

524
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh crap.

525
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh crap.

526
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Oh my god.

527
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm up in the somebody.

528
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm up in the somebody.

529
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yep, there he is.

530
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Help me!

531
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Shit, wow!

532
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The dead ring.

533
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Anybody, anybody?

534
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Oh, 9 damage.

535
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Thank god I did 9 damage.

536
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Oh man, this is bad news.

537
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Bad news right here.

538
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
What am I thinking?

539
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Oh god.

540
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I tied it up at the very end.

541
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Oh my god.

542
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm right at the very end.

543
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I tied it.

544
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Holy crap.

545
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Alright, we did, guys.

546
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
We are going to change servers now.

547
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So, thanks guys.

548
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Jumping in this one.

549
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's going to be one.

550
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm going to clean this milk up.

551
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm going to clean this mad milk up.

552
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Vy-duct.

553
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
No, that's, I don't know where that is.

554
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Five gorge could be cool.

555
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
How else we got?

556
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Granary.

557
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I might be feeling granary right now.

558
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I think I'm feeling granary, guys.

559
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Sawmill a granary.

560
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Alright.

561
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Sawmill a granary.

562
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Granary is, we're doing granary.

563
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
In the Reddit server apparently.

564
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'll be that.

565
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Here you go.

566
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Here's the news.

567
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Granary is one of those maps that you never feel like playing on it.

568
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
But once you're actually playing on it, you have a good time.

569
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I don't know why.

570
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Every single time I play granary, it's like, oh, do I want to play granary?

571
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I don't think so.

572
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:31,000
But then when I actually get on it, it's like, oh, this is fun.

573
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Oh, it just changed a well.

574
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Well, that's cool.

575
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I feel the same way about well, though, to be honest.

576
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Alright, let's go.

577
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Here we go.

578
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'll go red because I was on blue last time.

579
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Maybe not.

580
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Maybe so.

581
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Nope.

582
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Let me join red.

583
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
This time we're going to play demo.

584
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Default demo, man.

585
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

586
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Strange lock and load.

587
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Almost forgot.

588
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I almost forgot.

589
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Mission begins and 30 seconds.

590
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Mission begins.

591
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
One second.

592
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Go!

593
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I don't know what that took my games, huh?

594
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I don't know, but let any of the men get a better internet.

595
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
No, let's see.

596
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Can I kill somebody?

597
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Come on.

598
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Are you having a good time?

599
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Oh, man.

600
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Oh, man.

601
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:57,000
The belt machine.

602
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Well, any of you, man.

603
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Will I be selling admin on my server?

604
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
No.

605
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I plan on just having people be able to play.

606
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And I'm sure that's, you know, if you play there for long enough and you're, you know, a good supporter of the server,

607
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I would just give it to you.

608
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You wouldn't have to pay for it.

609
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Save your money.

610
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
That was a bad jump.

611
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And now I'm going to die like instantly.

612
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
No, no, not OK.

613
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Where is everybody?

614
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Where is everybody?

615
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Nothing in there.

616
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

617
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
He's behind us.

618
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
He's dead now.

619
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Wow.

620
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, I thought he was going to walk out the door.

621
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's all right.

622
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Man, here.

623
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Oh, no.

624
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Oh, no, what's going on?

625
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
No, I'm going to drown.

626
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Oh, my God.

627
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I really thought I was going to drown right there, guys.

628
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Oh, come on.

629
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Oh, die.

630
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Here we go.

631
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Watch out behind us.

632
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Behind us.

633
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
See, I...

634
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Oh, God, I got wrecked.

635
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Right when I got over here.

636
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Oh, my God.

637
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I didn't expect this.

638
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Oh, I didn't even look.

639
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I should have been looking.

640
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm going to die.

641
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That's my bad.

642
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's up top, isn't it?

643
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Yep, it is.

644
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Nice job, guys.

645
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Nice job.

646
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Janoblin, then, ladies.

647
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Good job, gentle ladies and gentlemen.

648
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Who's that?

649
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Who is that?

650
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Who am I doing a repression up?

651
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Oh, jump.

652
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Mission begins in 30 seconds.

653
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Mission begins in 30 seconds.

654
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
We're going across the top.

655
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh, my God.

656
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Look who it is, ladies and gentlemen.

657
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Burger boy with like a chocolate melted in his mouth.

658
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Oh, what am I doing?

659
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I shouldn't have came this way.

660
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Why is that up here?

661
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Why is that up here?

662
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Who got up here?

663
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
How...?

664
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I've never seen someone from the last round.

665
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Come here.

666
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh, I'm never going to hit him.

667
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Oh, he just jumped into that.

668
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Where's my spray?

669
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I want a spray.

670
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Oh, come on, walk all over this.

671
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Come on.

672
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Come on.

673
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Oh, let me get it up there.

674
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Oh.

675
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Oh, well, at least we got it.

676
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Thanks, pal.

677
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Go this way, go this way, go this way.

678
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Give him a spice.

679
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
That might be a spice.

680
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I think it was.

681
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Yes, it was.

682
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Cartoons.

683
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Cartoons.

684
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Be careful, we're entering the enemy base.

685
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Oh, man, we might be like a team scramble.

686
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Oh.

687
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Oh boy.

688
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Oh, get out of town.

689
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
No, we're damaged.

690
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I thought if I were just being try hard mode right there, I could just be quiet and kill him.

691
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Oh, the team's like a start that bad.

692
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
We could probably use a scramble.

693
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Maybe not.

694
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
We'll find out.

695
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Going this way, going this way.

696
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That's a dude right here.

697
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Oh boy, heads up, heavy.

698
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Really not anymore.

699
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh, I thought I was going to hit him.

700
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It's all about that little area, little corridor.

701
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Oh, I thought he didn't get hit by that.

702
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
What is up with that?

703
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
How can we, we're defending this point right?

704
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Oh my god, we're going to get like four here.

705
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm going to die.

706
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm going to die.

707
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Help me.

708
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Oh, suicide.

709
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm going to die.

710
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Damn.

711
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
The heavy baby.

712
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Actually, I talked to DJ like last night, he about it.

713
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
He's got a lot of stuff.

714
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
He's a hard work, he's got a lot of cool ideas.

715
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
He's working on a lot of stuff.

716
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So, it's coming.

717
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Well, you just gave me.

718
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Thought you were an enemy.

719
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Oh no, why did I do that?

720
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I got behind everybody and no one knew I was there.

721
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
What is wrong with me?

722
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh, what does the matter with me?

723
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
If I had just like not been a freak show, I'd probably

724
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
would have had a couple of kills right there.

725
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I made it.

726
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Whoa.

727
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh, come on.

728
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Come on.

729
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
All right, we're going viral.

730
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Fire with the flare gun and I don't, I do have an aggressive.

731
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I have a decrease.

732
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You got to use the console to enter the server.

733
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I think it's the till day key.

734
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You have to enable it.

735
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Hold on a second.

736
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I've got a pier offline.

737
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Just so I have those notifications stop popping up.

738
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Because nobody wants to see the notifications.

739
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
They want to see team fortress two.

740
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I don't know what's going on.

741
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Oh, God, so much stuff going on.

742
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
No, don't die.

743
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'm trying to save the heavy.

744
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Somebody got to hit by the bus, I think.

745
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah, this is the till day key.

746
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You want to enable it.

747
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You've got to options.

748
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Enable developer console.

749
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I want that checked.

750
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And once that is checked by default, it is the till day key.

751
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The thing under escape.

752
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And it looks like this.

753
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Then you type in connect space.

754
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Then the IP and then enter.

755
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And that's it.

756
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And that's all she wrote.

757
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Massive bus accident.

758
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
This way.

759
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Oh, no.

760
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Damn it.

761
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Damn it.

762
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Damn it.

763
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Damn it.

764
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm going to spell it out.

765
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
D-A-M-N-I-T-E.

766
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I have never played TF2 where.

767
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It's hysterical though.

768
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And I am absolutely willing to try.

769
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
They're pushing us back.

770
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
They have pushed us all the way back.

771
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
This is not good.

772
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm hanging out here.

773
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:41,000
TF2 where is like a Wario ware mod for team fortress where you get like five seconds to do a little midi game.

774
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's very funny.

775
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I've seen videos on it.

776
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'll check with them.

777
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Oh, damn it.

778
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Oh god, this chaos.

779
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Shoot at me.

780
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Somebody shoot at me with something.

781
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Oh god, that was just chaos.

782
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'll have control point being captured.

783
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Got a move that I get up.

784
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Yeah, I actually own Gary's mod.

785
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'm not very good at it though.

786
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I know a lot of people in Gary's mod can make ridiculous things.

787
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm not one of those people.

788
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Like, oh, I made this boat.

789
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
That's actually a car.

790
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
That's actually a house.

791
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And it moves and these mouths are animated.

792
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I can't do anything like that.

793
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I wish I could.

794
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Oh my god.

795
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh my god, retreat.

796
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Wow.

797
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
No, no, no.

798
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Oh, there's nothing I can do about that.

799
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Damn it.

800
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
New server, guys.

801
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
We'll do one more new server and then we're going to hop over to Binding of Isaac probably.

802
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Oh, I'm going to hop over to Binding of Isaac.

803
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Probably.

804
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Last empty server.

805
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
We're going to find you.

806
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Auxiliary operation.

807
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
What the hell is that?

808
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
1-32.

809
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Actually, this one's 1-28.

810
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Bad water.

811
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
We can end it on bad water.

812
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
There you go.

813
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Join that server right now, ladies and gentlemen.

814
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That's the new IP.

815
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'll post it again.

816
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And there it is again.

817
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Oh man.

818
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'll go defense again.

819
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm going to go big century engineer.

820
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Oh man, this is depressing.

821
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Where's all my stuff?

822
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Where's all I have?

823
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Where's all my hats?

824
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I still have this.

825
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I can put this on.

826
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Boy, I can wear this.

827
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Oh, cool.

828
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I don't know I can wear that.

829
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
That's awesome.

830
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Hell yeah, I'll wear that.

831
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'll wear my ring.

832
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Do well.

833
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Do well.

834
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Let's do it.

835
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Big century engineer.

836
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
That built.

837
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Get it to, you know what, just do an intro.

838
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You want to have a engineer.

839
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm good.

840
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I'd rather have the Return to Glory.

841
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Appreciate it.

842
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Okay.

843
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But thank you, though, for crying.

844
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Appreciate that.

845
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Where's it going?

846
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Let's go right here.

847
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
It's a pretty safe place usually.

848
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Now, you know what, this is going over here.

849
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That's going over here.

850
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Okay.

851
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Oh yeah, we're on fire.

852
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Fire, fire, fire, fire.

853
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Hey, Nucklelegs, I'm talking to you.

854
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Bunk.

855
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Oh, what?

856
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Okay.

857
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
That just scared the crap out of me.

858
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
That just scared me.

859
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Like I've really got scared by that.

860
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Like it was like, oh man, I'm sorry, you guys.

861
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:03,000
If you were in that server and you just got in and you, I really am sorry.

862
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Okay, well, let's do this again.

863
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
This one is not, no, I don't know about there.

864
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
12 people in about already.

865
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Damn, that was dumb.

866
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
All right.

867
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Dustfall, no, this one's bad.

868
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
There's this, this bot's here.

869
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So if we start to join this, it'll get rid of the bots, right?

870
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That's usually what happens.

871
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I'm pretty sure that's what happens.

872
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So let's try this one.

873
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Bad water basin.

874
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Hopefully this one doesn't just turn off, instant turn off.

875
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Oh, I hope you're enjoying your time because it's about to instant turn off.

876
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
All right, I'll stick with this.

877
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'll stick with this.

878
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Going over here, though.

879
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Oh, you're already over there.

880
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
All right, you got that coming?

881
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm cool.

882
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I'll stick with right there.

883
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Here, but why is Bergerboy so fat?

884
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Hey, that's not nice.

885
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:26,000
That's a nice thing to say about Bergerboy.

886
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I'll just get the thing again.

887
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
This is a bad spot for that.

888
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I don't know why I put that there.

889
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I need to move that eventually.

890
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Somebody's right there, and this shoot at it.

891
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
You know what?

892
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I might move my, I'm going to move it.

893
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I'm going up here.

894
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm going to go over here.

895
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Looks like they're not capping.

896
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

897
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Oh, dammit, dammit, dammit.

898
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
He doesn't have a sapper.

899
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
He doesn't have sapper.

900
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Somebody take care of that.

901
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You know what?

902
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm going to go up Gonslinger.

903
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You guys have a feeling that's going to happen a thousand more times.

904
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Man, dude.

905
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I'm going to give my dispenser to this guy.

906
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I'm going to put it over here.

907
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Somebody comes in Hoover Chargers and kills that.

908
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
He'll have this backup one.

909
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
In case he needs it.

910
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,000
There you go, sir.

911
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Go get some more.

912
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm going to leave.

913
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Whoops, didn't mean to click.

914
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Oh, what the hell?

915
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Run away.

916
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
That's a double mini-center.

917
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
You're still a lot.

918
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Dammit, I've got too many spies.

919
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Too many spies.

920
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Oh, Engineer, I'm not going to play with you.

921
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I have a soldier.

922
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Soldier with the Strangelovedy launcher and the...

923
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Talience backup.

924
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Why not?

925
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Might as well.

926
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And the Strangest touch.

927
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Do I want a vintage transmit?

928
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm good.

929
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'll be okay.

930
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Thank you, though.

931
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I'd rather, like I said before, rather you guys keep your stuff.

932
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Thanks for the aid.

933
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Because you could use it, too.

934
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
What?

935
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Oh, my god.

936
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
This is fantastic.

937
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I'm dead instantly.

938
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Didn't even see that.

939
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Oh, they're going to win.

940
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
No, I don't know.

941
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I want the...

942
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Just walk into that.

943
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
If I were to have needed any weapon of my choice, if I were to want it,

944
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Strangest Huntsman, everyone was just talking about my god.

945
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's worth like 50 million dollars or something.

946
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,000
We're a 500,000 million trillion dollars.

947
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Let's get on a streak here.

948
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
What do you say?

949
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Let's get on a streak.

950
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:43,000
The reserve shooter would have been like a better option.

951
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Be careful.

952
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Be careful here.

953
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Be careful.

954
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Oh, boy.

955
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
He's in trouble.

956
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Watch out there.

957
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
He's trying to fool us.

958
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Oh, it's the losing fight.

959
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's the losing fight.

960
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Gotta get away.

961
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Oh, come on.

962
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Look at this health.

963
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Look at this health.

964
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Should you use your three refined to craft a hat or should you trade it?

965
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Oh, it depends what hat you want.

966
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Because if you go into a trading server, you can, for a lot of the time,

967
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
you can get one hat for one refined.

968
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Like one of those craftable hats, it really depends on if you want a just a hat.

969
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
If you could potentially get like three hats with three refined.

970
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Or if you want to make a random one and potentially get one of the new ones.

971
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I got an email apparently.

972
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
No idea what that is about.

973
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Can I check that after I die?

974
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
He's going up here.

975
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Oh, that was lucky.

976
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Anybody in here?

977
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:15,000
You're not a spy.

978
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Oh, my God, it's a century.

979
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Shit.

980
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Damn it.

981
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Oh, they're going to get it.

982
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
They're going to get it.

983
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Gotta get rid of that century.

984
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Even if I die, I'm a demon.

985
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I'm a sinner right there.

986
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
The difference between dirty and clean items, I really don't know.

987
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I'm not a real big trader.

988
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So I'm not really sure how the link goes.

989
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I think clean is when it doesn't say who crafted it.

990
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Isn't that what it means?

991
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Oh, uncraftable, okay.

992
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Wow.

993
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I think we're good.

994
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I think we got it.

995
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Oh, God.

996
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Oh, run.

997
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I don't have an equalizer.

998
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I'm a trouble.

999
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I bump into a spy too.

1000
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
They're going to get it.

1001
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I didn't even see what I'm sorry.

1002
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I'm looking back and forth at the chat in the game.

1003
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
What had you talked about?

1004
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Did you want the hat, Jerma?

1005
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I'm just reading.

1006
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I would like it if you guys don't have to give me anything.

1007
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I got plenty of stuff.

1008
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I got plenty of options where I can get things.

1009
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
You guys hold on to your items.

1010
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
They're your harder items.

1011
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You guys deserve them not being.

1012
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I'm dead.

1013
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I got the help.

1014
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Oh, crit.

1015
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Outside 100, I have a setup video.

1016
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
If you go to my YouTube channel and you type in 4,000 subs,

1017
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I did like a 4,000 subscriber thing a long, long time ago.

1018
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And it's a setup video.

1019
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And it's got the same, I got the same computer.

1020
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I'm probably going to get a new computer at some point in the near future.

1021
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I would assume probably the next couple of months I will get a new computer.

1022
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Well, that's over.

1023
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
You failed.

1024
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
All right.

1025
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So, I think I'm going to transition open to binding a bison for one life or two lives or something like that.

1026
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
We'll see what I do.

1027
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
F***.

1028
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Binding of Isaac is a really weird, really disturbing kind of.

1029
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It's made in Flash, I think.

1030
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
It's a steam game to get its five bucks.

1031
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It's very, very disturbing and very screwed up.

1032
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So, I will put that disclaimer out there before I stream it.

1033
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
But yeah, thank you guys if you would see her for the TF2.

1034
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Then, thank you so much for coming to watching.

1035
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
You guys rock and roll.

1036
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And I'll catch you guys probably next time.

1037
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
And I'll be getting the face by frying, F***.

1038
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
F***.

1039
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
F***.

1040
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
No one come over to where I'm at.

1041
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I don't really care.

1042
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
All right.

1043
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Let's do some binding of Isaac.

1044
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
No, hold on to your hats.

1045
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Hold on to your hats.

1046
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Hold on to your seats.

1047
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Let me see if I can stream this.

1048
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Bap, bap.

1049
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Actually, I got to change this on here or two.

1050
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:48,000
On the dash, the dashboard.

1051
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Dashboard.

1052
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Playing, binding of Isaac.

1053
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Update.

1054
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Yeah, I got to change my background.

1055
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Actually, let's change my background.

1056
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Because this has been my background for a very long time.

1057
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Let's change the background.

1058
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
All right.

1059
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,000
So, let's do personalize.

1060
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Desktop backgrounds.

1061
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Desktop background.

1062
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
All right.

1063
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
So, do I want like the space needle?

1064
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Oh, God.

1065
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I might be like breaking the stream.

1066
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Maybe not.

1067
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Let's see.

1068
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Okay, I'm not.

1069
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I think I like the space needle.

1070
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Put up a photo of Grandpa.

1071
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
What about the ice one?

1072
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Oh, sweet.

1073
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Oh, what about this one?

1074
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Oh, man.

1075
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh, this is the one.

1076
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
This is the one I'm keeping.

1077
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Look at this thing.

1078
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
That thing is beautiful.

1079
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Save changes.

1080
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Look at this.

1081
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Gorgeous.

1082
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Gorgeous screen.

1083
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It's like a painting.

1084
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
All right.

1085
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
It's okay.

1086
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
So, let's play binding of Isaac.

1087
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So, disclaimer.

1088
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Binding of Isaac is an incredibly messed up disturbing, crazy, insane game.

1089
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So, viewer discretion is advised.

1090
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'm going to say that before playing, because obviously this game is ridiculous.

1091
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Probably the stream doesn't die.

1092
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I don't think it will.

1093
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Let's take a look.

1094
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,000
The audio is going to have to come down a little bit.

1095
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's okay.

1096
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
The binding of Isaac.

1097
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Isaac.

1098
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Okay.

1099
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Change this.

1100
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
It's going to go black.

1101
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Black screen.

1102
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
That screen region.

1103
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Take this.

1104
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Let's stretch it out.

1105
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
All right.

1106
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Binding of Isaac.

1107
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
So, I'm pretty good at this game.

1108
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I've become pretty good at this game.

1109
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I love this game.

1110
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
It is so much fun.

1111
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It's just so addicting.

1112
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Go with the cane.

1113
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Cane.

1114
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Got the eye patch.

1115
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
All right.

1116
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Let's do it.

1117
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,000
The reason why I'm playing this again is because the DLC is coming out in the next couple of days,

1118
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I think.

1119
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
The binding of Isaac DLC should be out soon.

1120
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I'll get that bomb.

1121
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I'm going to run around like a psycho.

1122
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
So, if you like games that are...

1123
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
They call these rogue likes.

1124
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:46,000
They are rogue like dungeon crawlers.

1125
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
The real Blizzard 10121.

1126
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
How do you become a mod on the stream?

1127
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Usually the mods are people that I...

1128
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
that I'm like friends with that I talk to all the time and stuff like that.

1129
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
But yeah, I mean, if you've been coming for that long and you know...

1130
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I'll probably set up some type of way to get a mod.

1131
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
A way for you to get mod or wait for people to get mod if they want it.

1132
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
But it's hard to give mods to people because there's just so many people that that would want it.

1133
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
So it's very, very difficult to say.

1134
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Oh yeah, you can be a mod.

1135
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Sure.

1136
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Oh, triple shot.

1137
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
This is going to be a good game.

1138
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
This is going to be a good game.

1139
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
But it's hard to give up mod specifically because it's just so many people want it.

1140
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
So if I were to give it to one person and you know somebody else would be like,

1141
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
well, I want mod too.

1142
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And it's like, I...

1143
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
It's a very tough decision to make.

1144
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
So but eventually I will probably do...

1145
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I will probably do a...

1146
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
some type of way to get it.

1147
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I don't know how though.

1148
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Triple shot is incredible.

1149
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Did triple shot extra damage more tears?

1150
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You're talking about absolute chaos.

1151
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Let me get that bomb and open up the secret room for crying out loud.

1152
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Spreadgun.

1153
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Oh, and now there's the troll bomb.

1154
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
That's not cool.

1155
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Reply contest.

1156
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Mod giveaway.

1157
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
You know what?

1158
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
You know what?

1159
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
We have to build it.

1160
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I'll do some type of...

1161
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I don't know.

1162
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
It's hard.

1163
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I'll play one thing, but those of you that better hang out here.

1164
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I'm going to do...

1165
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I'm going to make a video and move this mouse.

1166
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I'm going to do a video on this in the next couple of days.

1167
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Next week's stream.

1168
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
It's going to be very, very interesting.

1169
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Because I'm going to do a game show.

1170
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I'm going to...

1171
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I'm going to...

1172
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I'm going to try and explain this.

1173
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I'm going to buy like another like 30 or 40 keys

1174
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
and get a bunch of crates.

1175
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And what we're going to do is we're going to do like a trivia night

1176
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
where I have the screen open to on T-402

1177
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
and hold on.

1178
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I'm going to die.

1179
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
So the screen's open on T-402, like 40 crates with 40 keys.

1180
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
And I'm going to ask trivia questions.

1181
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Like, basic like gaming trivia questions.

1182
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,000
It's not going to be all totally T-402, so it might be some other general gaming questions.

1183
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
And if you get it right, if you're the first person to get it in the chat,

1184
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
then you get to pick which crate you want online.

1185
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And I just thought about that the other day.

1186
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I was like, you know, that would be actually really cool.

1187
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It would be fun.

1188
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
So that's the plan for next.

1189
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And I'm going to make a video on this.

1190
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
If you're watching this on YouTube and you're like, oh, wait, wait, wait.

1191
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
What? I want more details.

1192
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
This is going to be a video made about that very, very soon.

1193
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Do-do-do-do.

1194
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Alright, let's get some more help.

1195
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Yes, you will get what's inside.

1196
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
If you get the trivia question correct,

1197
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
you can open up whatever's in whatever crate you want.

1198
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
You get whatever's in there.

1199
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It doesn't matter if it's a $5 million unusual or paint.

1200
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
You're going to get it.

1201
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Oh no, no, no, no, get out of my way.

1202
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I don't want to tie this early.

1203
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Trouble shot.

1204
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Yeah, if you guys have crates,

1205
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I mean, I know I did a crate.

1206
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
People donated a lot to the last one.

1207
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
But if you have crates, if you have, you know,

1208
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I'd series 20 and above.

1209
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Anything lower than series 20, I don't think I would want.

1210
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I'll leave that alone for now.

1211
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
But it's just a way to involve everybody.

1212
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Because I think that would just be fun, like a trivia night.

1213
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
You know what I mean? Like, alright.

1214
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
In what level of, like, legend is Zelda?

1215
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Do you like just anything like that?

1216
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Find the master's sword.

1217
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Just general basic theory of questions.

1218
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
A lot of people would get involved if they were really fun.

1219
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And hopefully somebody gets something cool.

1220
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Oh, it's a lot of what you got.

1221
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Nothing on me.

1222
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
You got nothing on me in my triple shot, baby.

1223
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
There would be a lot of team fortress questions though.

1224
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Like, oh, in what crate can you get a strange deradi?

1225
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Oh, I'm gonna die.

1226
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I'm like too busy talking about what I'm doing with my next dream.

1227
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I'm like, not gonna be paying attention to this one.

1228
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
This is hard.

1229
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I have to use it.

1230
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Oh, what am I doing? I didn't have to use that.

1231
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I couldn't use it in my whatever.

1232
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Whatever, that's me being a really, really dumb stupid person.

1233
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
But you know what?

1234
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
At least I can see it right there.

1235
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Let's see if the room's right there.

1236
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
What I need is I need damage up.

1237
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I know I have a stealth.

1238
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I know.

1239
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I know.

1240
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I know.

1241
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
There you go.

1242
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
So it's a music too loud right now.

1243
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I feel like it is.

1244
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Or am I just freaking out?

1245
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Oh, come on, hit him.

1246
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Okay.

1247
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:35,000
You know, I have headphones on so it's kind of tough to me to decipher how loud something is or not.

1248
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
And open up that secret room, baby.

1249
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Three dollars or three pennies, not dollars.

1250
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
That's not a total waste of a secret room.

1251
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I'm gonna die.

1252
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I'm gonna die.

1253
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I'm gonna die.

1254
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And he's not dollars.

1255
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
That's not a total waste of a secret room.

1256
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
How do you get the crates to me?

1257
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I'll probably set up some type of way.

1258
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Everybody doesn't have to give them though.

1259
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Because obviously I only need like 30 or 40 of them.

1260
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I want to give you stuff.

1261
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Should you get this game?

1262
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I'm going to 100% absolutely 100 million percent say yes, yes, yes, a million times.

1263
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
This is an incredibly fun and incredibly different game.

1264
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
It's just like a like 17 and up.

1265
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Like if this is this game is not designed for like younger people to play.

1266
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Only because of the incredibly like blasphemous and ridiculous imagery that is associated with it.

1267
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
If you don't care about that then this game is one of the most fun addictive.

1268
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Probably one of the best games I've ever played that's under $10.

1269
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
This game is only five bucks.

1270
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
This game is five dollars on steam.

1271
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Like yikes, that's insane.

1272
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
This was actually supposed to be corded to the 3DS.

1273
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
But Nintendo said, yeah, yeah, that's not happening.

1274
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I don't want to comment cause these things.

1275
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Do I even have enough money for anything?

1276
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I don't think so.

1277
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Not even worth opening this door.

1278
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Not even worth opening the door.

1279
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I don't even have enough money to get anything in there.

1280
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Die!

1281
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Come on, hit him.

1282
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I got the triple shot.

1283
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Yeah, Nintendo said because of religious and blasphemous images.

1284
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
The game is just really very very dark.

1285
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
So it is only on steam.

1286
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It's the only place you can get it.

1287
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I don't think it's on Xbox Live.

1288
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Oh, look at the sun card.

1289
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Might as well like waste it.

1290
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And I'll come back to the judgment.

1291
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Oh, it's what this boss is but.

1292
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Give an eye.

1293
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I'm like tempted to just use the sun card and not have to even fight this guy.

1294
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
But you know what?

1295
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I'm not going to do that.

1296
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
We will do this the right way.

1297
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I'm trying to get rid of the baby first.

1298
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I don't think I can though.

1299
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Pretty sure you can.

1300
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And eat more tears.

1301
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Not shooting fast enough.

1302
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Something from the future I unlocked.

1303
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Some now in the basement.

1304
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Speed up.

1305
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Hmm.

1306
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Hmm.

1307
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I would use the sun card.

1308
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
But honestly it's just it's a uh...

1309
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
It's a oh crap moment.

1310
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Like I'm going to die.

1311
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I'm going to die.

1312
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Use it.

1313
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I'm not sure you sell bank.

1314
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I will take whatever is in there.

1315
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Take that key.

1316
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Thank you very much.

1317
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
How do you play this game?

1318
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
It's just with the keyboard.

1319
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
And you just go from room to room.

1320
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Clearing out all the monsters just like Legends of Zelda or Star tropics.

1321
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Or other games that are around the same design philosophy.

1322
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Once you kill every single thing in the room,

1323
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I see the top left of the map.

1324
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
You can see what rooms are open that you can go to.

1325
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Fight the boss.

1326
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
You kill the boss.

1327
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
And if you die, it's over.

1328
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
You cannot continue.

1329
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
There is no lives.

1330
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
There is no continuing.

1331
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
You just die.

1332
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And if you start all over again.

1333
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
This is going to be a room where I might have to be...

1334
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I just take this nice and slow.

1335
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I don't need to use the song card.

1336
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I think I've heard of these guys.

1337
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
There we go.

1338
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
There we go.

1339
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Yeah, they're your big fat red bastard.

1340
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Oh!

1341
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
The question is, how am I going to do it?

1342
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I'm going to do it.

1343
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Get the coin and the bomb back.

1344
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Oh!

1345
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Hmm.

1346
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I'll take that.

1347
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Yeah.

1348
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Money, money.

1349
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Lots of money.

1350
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Now if I see an item room, I will open the door.

1351
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Because it will be actually worth it.

1352
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Pills.

1353
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Cain is the best with pills.

1354
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Take them.

1355
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Oh!

1356
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Goddammit.

1357
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
If I had only known that.

1358
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I had only known that.

1359
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Blast damage increased.

1360
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Oh, I hate this item.

1361
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Because it freaks me out.

1362
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Look at my guy.

1363
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
That looks really screwed up.

1364
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Okay.

1365
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Should I go into the mob room?

1366
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I'll do it. Why not?

1367
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Oh, more pills.

1368
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Who knows what they are?

1369
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I'm not going to use any of them.

1370
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Man, I'm shooting way too slow.

1371
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
This is like messing with me.

1372
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Leave faster. Speed.

1373
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Firing speed.

1374
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Die.

1375
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Bad.

1376
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
These guys make a really weird noise.

1377
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Oh, if I could just kill them faster!

1378
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Die.

1379
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Oh, come on.

1380
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
They don't shoot faster though.

1381
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
There we go.

1382
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Oh, come on!

1383
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
You freaking bastards.

1384
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Oh, my God.

1385
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Oh, my God.

1386
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Oh, my God.

1387
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Oh, my God.

1388
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:21,000
There we go.

1389
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Let's see what this is.

1390
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Oh, no!

1391
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Well, that was dumb.

1392
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
So I've got one more place and I have the secret room.

1393
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Probably right here.

1394
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Maybe right here or down.

1395
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Now it's got to be down here.

1396
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Thank you very much.

1397
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Eggs.

1398
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I will take these eggs.

1399
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Oh, alright.

1400
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Easy as pie.

1401
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
These guys are nothing.

1402
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
The hanged man.

1403
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Oh, this one's kind of not really neat that right now.

1404
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
But I will blow up this machine for sure.

1405
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
And I'm going to, can I do it with the common cosy?

1406
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I don't even know if I can.

1407
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I'm not going to pretend to know.

1408
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
The Emperor.

1409
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
What does the Emperor do?

1410
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I forget what MLC stealth.

1411
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
What does the Emperor do?

1412
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
What do I do?

1413
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
What does this one do?

1414
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I forget.

1415
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
And MLC stealth takes you to the boss.

1416
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Absolutely not going to do that.

1417
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I will pick this back up.

1418
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
The Sun card.

1419
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Hmm, don't even.

1420
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I'm not going to try and get it.

1421
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
It's sticking with the Sun card.

1422
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Oh, my, I'm using it.

1423
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
That was just, I, that would have had bad news written all over it.

1424
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Okay.

1425
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Ten bombs.

1426
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Get on doing it.

1427
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I'm absolutely doing it.

1428
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And I'll get the key too.

1429
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
And I'll get the heart.

1430
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I'll get it all.

1431
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I'll buy your whole damn store up.

1432
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Take the hanged man.

1433
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Actually, what?

1434
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
No, I don't want the Emperor card.

1435
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Well, you know what? I will take the Emperor card.

1436
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
You know why?

1437
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Because there's nowhere other rooms to go.

1438
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
And let's go!

1439
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Versus a fistudah.

1440
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
You don't blow up.

1441
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I'm using, I'm using these bombs on them.

1442
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Actually, no, that's not a good idea.

1443
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I'm going to be in a lot of trouble because I'm shooting way too slow.

1444
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
This is way too slow, Vishal.

1445
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
God.

1446
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
At least I did that.

1447
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Okay. Now I'll get out of my way.

1448
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I'll re- I just saw what you said.

1449
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Blizzard.

1450
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I just don't want to die.

1451
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
So I'll address it in a second.

1452
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Okay.

1453
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:31,000
German, would you like any steam games like Crossers or maybe Serious and Free?

1454
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I don't have...

1455
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Oh!

1456
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Tears up, tears up, tears up.

1457
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Yes. Awesome.

1458
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
It's exactly what I needed.

1459
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I don't have Gotham City and Posters, but I have a lot of stuff to do.

1460
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I don't have Gotham City and Posters, but I own Serious Sam 3.

1461
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
So you don't need to give me that.

1462
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I do not have Gotham City and Posters.

1463
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I keep hearing it's fun though.

1464
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Can you pronounce my name?

1465
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
XXX

1466
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Latha1XXX.

1467
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I even came close.

1468
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Oh, come on, get out of my face.

1469
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
At least I got faster tears. This is way better.

1470
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
My keyboard's getting stuck.

1471
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
My keyboard's stuck getting stuck.

1472
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
But I've heard nothing but good things about Gotham City and Posters.

1473
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I heard when it launched they had a lot of problems.

1474
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I think it still has connection problems.

1475
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember people talking about that being like, I can't even play the game.

1476
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Open Sesame.

1477
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Open Sesame.

1478
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
All right, let me read the chat.

1479
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Somebody had said something.

1480
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Will you be doing playthrough Borderlands 2?

1481
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I will probably be...

1482
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I will probably be...

1483
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
So, I'm not sure exactly who I'll play with.

1484
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I have no idea.

1485
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
But yes, I'm assuming I will play.

1486
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Where's the DLC for this game?

1487
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Talking about new releases.

1488
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Why don't we get the...

1489
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
The wrath of the lamb, whatever it's called, the DLC?

1490
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Oh my god.

1491
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
You know what?

1492
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Eat bomb.

1493
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Oh!

1494
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Oh!

1495
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I used to come a cause and it killed me.

1496
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I hit the space bar and it...

1497
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Oh my god.

1498
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Dude, I accidentally hit the space bar and it killed me.

1499
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I can't believe I had the stupid item.

1500
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I cannot believe it.

1501
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I am so mad right now.

1502
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I could put my fist through the screen.

1503
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Like, what?

1504
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:11,000
My finger happened to slip over the space bar and touch it.

1505
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I can't believe it.

1506
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I can't believe it.

1507
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I can't believe it.

1508
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I can't believe it.

1509
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Oh.

1510
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I went like this.

1511
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Oh, oops, I hit space.

1512
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Oh god, damn.

1513
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
That was a good run, too.

1514
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I was doing fine.

1515
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
All right, it's time for quap.

1516
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I just...

1517
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Come on.

1518
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I am so upset right now.

1519
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Freaking internet connection.

1520
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
It's time for quap.

1521
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
That's...

1522
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I can't believe it.

1523
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I'm sitting there doing...

1524
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I'm running through Viningavisic without a problem.

1525
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
And I hit the space bar because I have the Dan Kamikaze.

1526
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Well, we're just going to kill you.

1527
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I don't even pick that item up.

1528
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
What a worthless item.

1529
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Goddamn.

1530
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Oh.

1531
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Well, you know, whatever.

1532
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
It was bound to happen.

1533
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
It was absolutely bound to happen.

1534
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
That that rage.

1535
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Let's do a new window.

1536
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Oh, god.

1537
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Hold on.

1538
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Oh, so long a second.

1539
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Whoops, it's a daisy.

1540
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Add screen region.

1541
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Man, here it is.

1542
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Quap, quap, quap, quap.

1543
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Quap.

1544
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Oh, I'm still mad.

1545
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I'm still like upset about that.

1546
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
We're going to have another quaps on.

1547
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
See if I can get a quaps on.

1548
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
The only way I play this game is if I can do a quaps on.

1549
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
So here we go.

1550
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Ready?

1551
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Plank rock.

1552
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Plank rock.

1553
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
We got a break.

1554
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
The whole game.

1555
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
We play.

1556
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
We play every day to date.

1557
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
We got a quaps, quaps, quaps, quaps, quaps, quaps, quaps.

1558
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
We got a crown to quaps with a slop and a block and a block.

1559
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
It sucks.

1560
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
It sucks.

1561
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
We'll do another one.

1562
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
It's going to start.

1563
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
It's going to start like this.

1564
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Ready?

1565
01:18:50,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Quap is the only game you play when you want to play every single day to snug.

1566
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
You got a snug.

1567
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:08,000
The only time you play you got to say quap is the only game you play when you snug today.

1568
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
That's a snug.

1569
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And I can't even move.

1570
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I can't even move today, but that's not the way we say today.

1571
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
We pray we got a quaps, quaps, quaps, quaps, quaps.

1572
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
My mind is like all over the place right now.

1573
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Look at this guy's legs.

1574
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
It's freaking me out.

1575
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I got to get past 15 meters.

1576
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Dead.

1577
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Dead.

1578
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Slux, slux.

1579
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
All right, I got past 10.

1580
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I got to get past 15.

1581
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Oh yeah, baby.

1582
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
What do you know about that?

1583
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Oh my god.

1584
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Oh my god.

1585
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Oh my god.

1586
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I was doing it, guys.

1587
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Now we're doing it.

1588
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Oh, I got it.

1589
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I figured it out.

1590
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I figured it out.

1591
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I figured it out how to play quap.

1592
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
All right, last try.

1593
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Last try.

1594
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Come on.

1595
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I got to get back into that.

1596
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I had it.

1597
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I was running.

1598
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I was legitimately sprinting.

1599
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Strange love.

1600
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Oh, you slug bastard.

1601
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
All right, if I get by 10, I'm good.

1602
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Nope.

1603
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Okay, whatever.

1604
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Oh, that's going to be it, guys.

1605
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
That's going to be the end of the stream.

1606
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Nobody dreamed.

1607
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Dream of a dream stream.

1608
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
We got to go.

1609
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Go.

1610
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
That's the end of the stream.

1611
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Thank you for coming to the stream.

1612
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
We got to slug one more time to say goodbye.

1613
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Hey, everybody.

1614
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
See you later, guys.

1615
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1616
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Yeah, that's it.

1617
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
All right, ladies and girmes.

1618
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I'll see you guys later.

1619
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Thanks for coming out.

1620
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
All over 200 of you guys still here.

1621
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
You guys are amazing.

1622
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Thank you so much.

1623
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Peace and oh, I forgot to mention,

1624
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Grandpa is going to be, it's going to be on

1625
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Machinima Respawn in like 20 minutes.

1626
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
So if you want to see the new Grandpa trailer,

1627
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
it's pretty ridiculous.

1628
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
It's going to be there in like 25 minutes.

1629
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
So Machinima Respawn 20 minutes.

1630
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
And yeah, thanks so much, guys.

1631
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I'll see you all later.

01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Everybody.

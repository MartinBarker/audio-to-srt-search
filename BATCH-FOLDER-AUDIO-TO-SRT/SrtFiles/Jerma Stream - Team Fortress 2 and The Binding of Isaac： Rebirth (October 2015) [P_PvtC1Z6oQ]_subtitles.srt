1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You was making funny you you thought we you thought we weren't coming back

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
When I see something like that I see somebody tell you know he never comes back

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We're back, okay

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000

Maybe these guys will play

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Invasion is so like three days ago

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Have a little bit of fun, man

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's all about 20 more hours and Victor friend

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm still transmuted remember that's bad for your street. We're the worst streamer. I hey, I

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Never said I was the best streamer today

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Did you up your bit rate yes, and it was fine, right? I think so yeah

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He doesn't even know he thinks I remember from what I can recall

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Because that stream I did 10 minutes ago is a fucking blur

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Shit

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Was your favorite character in TF2

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Engineer

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Not the scout who you look like him

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Scouts from Boston, German scout. No stars the scout Germans the soldier. Why do it the wrong way?

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Does this count as the second stream this week?

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, see this is two and one day come on

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's a lot

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And a lot of you said of that recording studio

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
God damn it

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Fucking pistol me

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
How does this map you this is the king of the hill map?

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Which one of cough probe

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I think I'm only I think I only played on this map for like two minutes

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Where's there there's the spawns in their

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
respective corners because that guy was all the way over here. I didn't expect to see a scout back here

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's the map with engineers on it. Oh, well, that's good enough

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I got this you're right there was a century told you

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm gonna stay down

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why is the engineer your favorite German I think he's the best character

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What just hit myself that was done

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because he ate yourself

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I think he I don't know he's just like for some reason to think he's the most interesting

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, like the characters in the game spy is also really interesting to

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Ask your questions ease

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, you haven't you haven't talked about this in a while. Yeah, you haven't seemed to really care

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, I don't know bastion just seems I

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Like the easy sentient robot that is very ambiguous and let's go easy

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You like smart guys, huh, German bastion bastions like

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, they did smart the spy smart national season the robot

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Who's your favorite world of work craft character and don't say the guy that's the boss guy?

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I was gonna say I'm

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Never mind under the answer I'm gonna say it. No, oh, he's gonna say a car. Yeah, Jack in my car

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
For beer

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Time to reap no

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Maybe I don't know Hanzo's kind of cool

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're getting your buddies worth for that stock ambulance ambulance, what a Jarcha?

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah, oh, that's this neighbor that wasn't cheap

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We filmed his neighbor dying I'm there you

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Come on

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Here oh

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm healthy

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Dr. Boom

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Dr. Boom a law Dr. Boom a low-well credited in my movie. Oh

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, you did do that then

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But you're for a quest the dumbest joke ever made the end of the let's address that the amount of people not that but

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The amount of people I thought that that I should have shot that

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The amount of people I thought that that was like real oh my god

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He filmed like an ambulance outside of his house. What is he doing?

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, that's that was the stock footage

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Wasn't wasn't me filming that yeah, you know you died

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I really do like missed contracts

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Miss like having something to do get every time I walk out of this fucking spawn. There's another person here to kill me

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This is walk out was spawned and get attacked at the game

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Cough pro almost like the enemies come back after you shoot them well, they're at the spawn

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Like every time I go around this corner there's a person here

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Would adore Jerma being taken by ambulance as a running joke I think that person wants you to be injured

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Or an over I might not ever do it again

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
They'll do it again

90
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Who knows that funny joke I did back four years ago

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We're doing it again. I'm gonna buy her said that

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
constantly

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Never out of those words. You said it five minutes ago

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What actually doesn't like anyone

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You get in a group call with Ashley. I just want to start shit

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
All right, well, it's over just like the outside my mentor

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Shit, I just kneeled on here for a

98
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Secretly count Chocula goodby

99
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh, I got only strange knives shit. I forgot I had all the strange knives

100
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's just like scared me. Yeah, I did another Victor Ranner no demons holes

101
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's so weird

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Did we do it the one time with all those hexes on them? That's when the David's will talk that

103
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Maybe that doesn't crease drops

104
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Probably it Derma, what's your opinion on them?

105
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
On what

106
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
molasses on

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
on

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Coffee what like like on cheesecrumb cake

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What about she's crumb cake what's your opinion that's actually pretty good?

110
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Actually, can you get me some of that?

111
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Didn't make it for you once oh

112
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't have a memory of making it for you

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think it's end to me is not Edmunds and I don't know I just eat it. I'm gonna come over here. What the hell?

114
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Like a memory is making a crumb cake and well to make a crumb cake. Oh shit. Oh

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I didn't have anything wrote it in damn it. What the hell?

116
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, I think you might have made a crumb cake, but not a cheese crumb cake. So I always I wish I had auto reload on but

117
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It distracts me

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It always distracts the hell out of me

119
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I agree

120
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Do you use auto reload? No, and if I do I turn a view models off didn't you used to long time ago?

121
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, and I turned view models off

122
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You claim I'm being Pac-Man for Halloween again

123
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Dude I

124
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That post for all I do is wine

125
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No, I had Halloween this year. I'm not even I don't know

126
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Dude, I really want to have a Halloween video, but are you gonna make that Halloween video you were planning on doing?

127
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't know potentially maybe I'm planning on doing the next couple of days. I'm not to look into if that's even remotely interesting

128
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But that has been the plan I've had for the last year. Fuck it. Someone else will kill him so

129
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You know when you just when there's a game and you mean to play it and you don't get around to it and it turns out rates is bad

130
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I

131
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Made plenty of videos where I go. I don't like that wasn't good. I don't want well. No, I mean like

132
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
When you're gonna play like you you have a game

133
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You know you're gonna play the game and like oh yeah, I probably make a video on that and then you finally actually play it

134
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And it's just it's just awful like rake like I waited three or four months to play rake and it just

135
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Wasn't into it

136
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Maybe I should just play it from the start

137
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
How many how many hours did you how long did you play rake for?

138
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Maybe an hour and a half I mean you can kind of tell what the whole game is pretty easily

139
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Medic I think I can't even get out of the fucking area

140
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We seriously this locked in what that book

141
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm ready to get him the soldiers just standing over here

142
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hey, man, hi, dude

143
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Did you get my message there?

144
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No, I can't pause the game and I'm I'm in spider world again. I don't know why I'm doing this again

145
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Find somebody to do this to I need an invite cuz my internet job for a second

146
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let me read

147
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We have oh boy

148
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We don't have any classes I can really give this to well, okay, it looks like I can give it to this pyro

149
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Jeremy should bring back scare Saturdays man

150
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That was hilarious because you would get genuinely scared haha

151
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Scary Saturdays

152
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000

153
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Seriously though playing rake today. I fucking flipped out. I think you might have heard me scream

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It was a genuine like who seriously are you fucking kidding me scream?

155
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The jump scare dude kind of used your screams now. I know I didn't expect rake to be like a spooky game

156
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I thought it was a goofy ha ha look at this

157
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Wasn't it wasn't goofy it was scary dude. I can just let go about my day and not notice you screaming

158
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's how common it is get on the point

159
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And see me

160
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Get over here. It's up on the point with me. Yes. Nice job

161
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm not like matched. I'm not like does other streamers items scream and

162
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Dude I used to like roller coasters because they were the only place like in public where you could legit scream and you wouldn't be judged

163
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
concerts

164
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah, you can stream it a concert too

165
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What?

166
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Go watch beeps. I'm just shaking so violently right now. I

167
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Would be the listen at concerts because I was polite

168
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Who the hell is Ashley?

169
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Who the hell is that?

170
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Nice

171
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Who the heck

172
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Stars to screams like the three times a stream

173
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You know I actually have noticed something about you do you do a lot of screaming I do you do scream

174
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Don't I've become a scrimmer?

175
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Sometimes I can't hold it back, you know

176
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I used to worry about our neighbors, but not anymore because he's like a welder

177
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh

178
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I saved your life no no what no no no no

179
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Get too many medics

180
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It could be engineer guy I'll be soldier man

181
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
With my dirty ass hamburger gun I

182
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Think I'm using the battle scar one because on purpose

183
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That's priceless by I would have to my suit

184
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I agree

185
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
This is Halloween this is Halloween

186
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Where'd that guy even come from?

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Came from Halloween

188
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Shit

189
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Do I not enjoy scare Saturdays? I mean it's it's just one of those things that it did I did it for a while

190
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I played all the scary kind of games that were around at the time and

191
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I did it I did it it was it was interesting it was fun for me when I did it but

192
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Now it's all played out just like don't come at it

193
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I don't know why I went up here

194
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You

195
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Walked up oh yeah

196
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Huge century

197
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The one day germ is gonna record a game that I've been asking to make a video on for like six months

198
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
At least maybe even a year at this point who knows maybe it is potential I

199
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Got it

200
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There is potential there could a good figure out maybe a Halloween video maybe that could be it. Oh boy

201
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We're in the

202
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
In that thing there

203
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh

204
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Damn it

205
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Damn it

206
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah

207
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He's gonna be surprised when he sees a heavy

208
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh boy

209
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We got a screamer that would have been great

210
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I would have been good, but they did it like a half second earlier

211
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm gonna play that new game that Stark keeps talking about

212
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So I don't think it's necessarily a new game

213
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's actually probably quite old at this point

214
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You're gonna check it out

215
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What am I going to check it out

216
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh, I can just crit the fuck out of me

217
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I

218
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah, I do have that I think I just put this on really quickly forgot again should have that on

219
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm not sure if I'm a fan of this map a lot of people I don't mind it

220
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
No truck truckers are not a fan I just boss that off my fucking own face

221
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So I dislike it it just feels very cluttered and people can like come from every direction

222
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
They really can't though they can god this guy with the mini crit eviction notice is fucking me up big time

223
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Spray the naran like crazy

224
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
After this round I'm gonna switch to the other map

225
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Wow look at drama picking favorites

226
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You know, you know who doesn't pick favorites mothers

227
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What

228
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That

229
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
that many

230
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
that is a trip across the map with that thing

231
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
should

232
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
is the invasion update the Halloween update

233
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
step

234
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
out on the

235
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
government

236
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
dot com

237
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
as wanted to

238
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
that guy went so high

239
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
are to

240
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
really high

241
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
right when I charged and I missed it that too. I'm gonna fucking pee my pants.

242
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You always say that.

243
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I know I do.

244
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah, you always do. I've seen your pants before.

245
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Oh, I went for the greedy other guy. I got it. It's okay. We're cool.

246
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Hello.

247
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Hello.

248
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Maybe your game?

249
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
No.

250
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
No.

251
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm almost done with it that I'm done playing.

252
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm gonna wrap around.

253
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I always say that.

254
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And then I catch you playing it later.

255
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
This people shooting me.

256
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Are you becoming very untrustworthy?

257
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Whoa!

258
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Warning you.

259
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
No. What if I...

260
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Does anybody...

261
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That was really weird.

262
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I like teleported to the right somehow.

263
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm done with Cryptarch.

264
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So it was a teleportation.

265
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
An hour later.

266
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Stir and see you play Cryptarch.

267
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What a day.

268
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You're still understanding.

269
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Nope.

270
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
All right.

271
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That's not what I do.

272
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm like, a gamer grad.

273
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The worst part of that is someone living here. There's no bathroom down where I am.

274
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So if I have to go... if I have to really pee real bad, I have to go all the way up

275
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
like the stairs.

276
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Oh no.

277
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I know.

278
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
No.

279
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
My god.

280
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
He's gotta go upstairs.

281
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I need your new stairs.

282
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
There's something today.

283
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
All right.

284
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm going to a server.

285
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
This... this probed map.

286
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I am not a fan.

287
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm not a hater of this map, but I'm not really a fan of it either.

288
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I don't know if you just walk up the door like I don't know.

289
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'll tell.

290
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You gotta pee on top of his pee so you know so that he knows that you're boss.

291
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Let's go to...

292
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I read that if you pee on top of pee, it's twice the amount of pee.

293
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I think you read that.

294
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I really didn't even like hear what you said.

295
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What did you say if you pee on top of pee?

296
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It wasn't important.

297
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It really wasn't.

298
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Now sometimes I just talk.

299
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I do.

300
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah.

301
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You do that sometimes.

302
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Now sometimes I like don't listen to anything that you're saying.

303
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
No, yeah.

304
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That happens quite often as well.

305
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
All right.

306
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Give me a high coup quick about the invasion update.

307
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I would have to count my hands and I don't have a hand free.

308
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You don't have a hand free.

309
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Yeah, how many is 575?

310
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's 575 or 757.

311
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I think it's 575.

312
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That's separately 575.

313
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yes, it is.

314
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Wow.

315
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm back in middle school right now.

316
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
The most popular poem structure in the world.

317
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
How does it feel to be a high coup?

318
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
High coup.

319
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Let's go in the beam together, guys.

320
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Actually, I know how this works.

321
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
How does this actually work?

322
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We only play this with humans.

323
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
That's the beer bottle thing.

324
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What's going on right here?

325
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Like, no one is fighting.

326
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Everyone just glitching into the beam.

327
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Dude, I think the demon souls are from doing the treasure things.

328
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Get those beer bottles.

329
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You get more?

330
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
No.

331
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Do you know where it's me?

332
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
No, that he's still alive.

333
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You have to do the challenges, I think.

334
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I see.

335
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
There he is.

336
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
There he is.

337
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Don't let him get away.

338
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I get six beer bottles.

339
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That means I can heal people.

340
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I can't heal people.

341
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I can't heal people.

342
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I can't heal people.

343
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I can't heal people.

344
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I can't heal people.

345
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I can't heal people.

346
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That means I can heal people.

347
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Cool.

348
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Oh, come back here, dude.

349
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Come back here, I got you.

350
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I ain't got a got you.

351
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I don't want to lose your four.

352
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:21,000
All right, where's that soldier?

353
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You fell.

354
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Everyone's fallen.

355
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm just going to deposit my beer bottles.

356
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Hopefully I can do this without dying.

357
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Okay.

358
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Anybody, anybody, anybody?

359
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I can do this, too.

360
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Fine, you know what's going to, you know what?

361
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Let's go for it.

362
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Get that soldier.

363
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I doubt you didn't hit that.

364
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's almost healthy.

365
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I got switched.

366
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That was the funniest thing you've said so far.

367
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You have, you have to one off that far.

368
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
That was the best thing you've done.

369
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I think your whole, your whole YouTube career.

370
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
That was it.

371
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Help.

372
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Only downhill from here.

373
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Well, generally, you had so many beer bottles, too.

374
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I mean, does this guy have?

375
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
He's only going anywhere.

376
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Give me the hill.

377
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Give me the hill.

378
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Give me up there.

379
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Give me all your bottles.

380
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
How many do you have?

381
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Quite a few, but I can't do anything now.

382
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Stop sneaking up on me.

383
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Ah.

384
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Where you go?

385
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I was trying to go for some cheeky little shit there.

386
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So this is the, that's text to speech.

387
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I thought that was some guy just going, we are in the beam.

388
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That's a text to speech program.

389
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm like something to chat with, I'm using a.

390
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
That's not the first time I've heard it either.

391
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Like somebody else was saying that, too.

392
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I think Malo has enough resources to hire a guy to say.

393
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The valve didn't make it.

394
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
They outsource.

395
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:46,000
The valve didn't make it.

396
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm going to go for that guy.

397
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Where are you?

398
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I'm going to go for that guy.

399
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Wow, that guy's got 19 shit.

400
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:23,000
That guy knows I don't have any health.

401
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I don't even have, I just have like random dumb hats on the sniper.

402
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
20.

403
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Deposit those 20.

404
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Make our lead stronger.

405
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
God, every time I've aimed in, I'm going to hit with a fucking,

406
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm going to put the camp around.

407
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'll give you a 14 to refine for that sniper.

408
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Give me one.

409
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Oh, yeah, everywhere.

410
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Some little fine guy.

411
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
This guy is still here.

412
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh my god.

413
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'll do a trade.

414
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I think I was just standing there waiting for me to come out.

415
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I could have got the health.

416
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Let's do a trade.

417
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Trade for a sniper.

418
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Are you trying to seduce somebody?

419
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
What do you want to trade?

420
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Let's trade you for a 14 to refine.

421
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I hope it's not worth a night.

422
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I give you a key, Jeremy.

423
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I don't think that guy is watching the stream.

424
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I really don't think he is.

425
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I don't think so.

426
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Jeremy, you should have the HUD that takes away the people.

427
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That's right.

428
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You have that cool, funny little HUD.

429
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Yeah, I do.

430
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And you never used a custom HUD in your life.

431
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I say it.

432
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So.

433
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah, I was fun for a day.

434
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I used the Garmin HUD.

435
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I don't know how that's missing.

436
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I really don't.

437
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And I get fucking crit to shit.

438
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
All right.

439
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It's time to go.

440
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm going to go pyro.

441
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Flare gun man.

442
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm going to go to the next one.

443
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm going to go to the next one.

444
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Don't, don't, don't.

445
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
No, that was way off.

446
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh my god, fucking damn it.

447
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:26,000
They are in the big.

448
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I really like this.

449
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
What's it called?

450
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The no stromo or something genuine no straw.

451
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
What's it called?

452
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Genuine no stromo napalmer.

453
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I like how it's true.

454
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Don't you have no stradamas is playing throw.

455
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I trade him the key for it.

456
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
There's a century in there.

457
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:11,000
That's good to know.

458
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Is that like respawning in 50 seconds?

459
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Okay.

460
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
That's why.

461
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:29,000
If you trade me, I'll let you respawn 50 seconds.

462
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'll try.

463
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'll do that.

464
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I run around as a scout guy.

465
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I want to take this off though.

466
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I want to put the hand sandwich on.

467
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I just want to say real quickly that Demi God is still being sold for $10.

468
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Is it?

469
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't see.

470
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yeah.

471
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
That game that can't be played.

472
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
We can't play.

473
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
We can't play Demi Gods.

474
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
What?

475
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I tried once and I opened the game and it was like, oh, those servers are down because this game is old.

476
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Are you serious?

477
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah.

478
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:09,000
So I'm wrong about that or like they've added server again.

479
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That's strange.

480
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
No, it's strange.

481
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Is that a scattergun?

482
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm trying to.

483
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It's another one of my, you know, you can't have it.

484
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Okay.

485
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Why can't I have this?

486
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You have all the purple glowers.

487
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Yeah, it's not purple, man.

488
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It's my favorite color.

489
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,000
What level is it?

490
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Let's take a look.

491
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm not sure if it's the real test.

492
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Do I have any other ones that are?

493
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I have a factory new.

494
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
This one's strong.

495
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I don't like this one, though.

496
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
This one, you can't even really tell you're wearing it.

497
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Like, look, ready?

498
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's like when you're running around, I'll put the factory new on.

499
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Like, Broadway is hard to even know that this is a different scattergun.

500
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You have to really, especially like a world model too.

501
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Like, what is your design on that?

502
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Night terror, that's what I'm all about.

503
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You can't even really tell if it's accepted.

504
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You can see it.

505
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You have to press the inspect key all the time.

506
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Like, as you watch me run around, it's hard to even determine if I'm wearing anything.

507
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Alright, fine.

508
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Okay.

509
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You want to do that?

510
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Is that what you want to do?

511
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Turn it over.

512
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Please wear some clothes.

513
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
105.

514
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
What do you got?

515
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Let's see it.

516
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I got 10.

517
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Let's see it.

518
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I want to see how much damage you do.

519
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Alright, go beyond your merry way.

520
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
That wasn't even as much damage as I did.

521
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I only hit you once, too.

522
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I only hit you once.

523
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You hit me more than once.

524
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I just want to see what you had.

525
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I want to see what you got.

526
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Alright, that's how it's going to be.

527
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Okay, so that's the way it is.

528
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Get away from me, pyro.

529
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You're done.

530
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Looks like you're streaming Team Fortress, too, to me.

531
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I am streaming Team Fortress, too, you.

532
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And a bunch of other people that are watching.

533
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Someone says, check.

535
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Kill that dumbass.

536
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Please, Derma.

537
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And he's referring to me.

538
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm sure you'd go to jail.

539
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I might jump on this guy.

540
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I just like jumped at his sword.

541
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Pretty sure killing dumbass is illegal.

542
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I think the judge just says, oh, yeah, it was a dumbass.

543
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Well, no, if you can prove that they were dumbass, you can get away with it.

544
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I get so upset whenever I see a heavy crouch with melee.

545
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It's like I'm conditioned to become angry as soon as it happens.

546
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Well, there's a soda there.

547
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It's called soda.

548
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah, you did.

549
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Actually, truck truck always calls them soda pops.

550
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
How have you not died?

551
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It's a hit point system that the game uses.

552
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Get in it.

553
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Come on, come on.

554
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Oh, he's getting.

555
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Stay in the beam.

556
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Hooray.

557
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
So dumbass is our important resource and are protected.

558
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
So they're like migratory birds.

559
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I can't see underwater.

560
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Derma, how does it feel to be a migratory bird?

561
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Oh, no.

562
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Good one.

563
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Fuck, it is misquicked.

564
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
We are in the stream.

565
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I hit every other pellet from the gun.

566
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Unfortunately.

567
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:46,000
There's a visual novel on steam about someone becoming a Starcraft 2 Pro.

568
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It seems like the weirdest.

569
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
How can we not buy it?

570
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
It's free.

571
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's recommended by the curator.

572
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It says it's great.

573
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Curator.

574
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I've been acting so much about Starcraft 3 Pro.

575
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
That's so on.

576
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Wow, he just fucking curators.

577
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Oh, that a case.

578
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Where?

579
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I still haven't seen a invasion crate.

580
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Was that just a gun?

581
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Hold on.

582
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Was that a gun metal case?

583
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yes, it was.

584
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I haven't played in a couple of days, but I haven't gotten the invasion case drop.

585
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
That seems a little strange.

586
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
They're dropping the gun metal cases.

587
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Still?

588
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Do you think that would drop would be replaced?

589
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Thanks so.

590
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
You're not dead.

591
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I mean those beers.

592
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Holy shit, you have so many.

593
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Oh my god, if I could fucking hit you.

594
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Go with the ham.

595
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Once you can't fucking hit shit, just bring out the ham.

596
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
That's very, very important.

597
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Just strategy.

598
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:55,000
That was you.

599
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That bloody loot, hey, box.

600
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I got door cube.

601
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
That's what it was.

602
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
The door cube.

603
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Be careful, sniper.

604
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I'm not really spy.

605
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Yeah.

606
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah.

607
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Ow.

608
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
The invasion crates have a stupidly ridiculously low drop rate.

609
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
They're not more expensive after the event is over.

610
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
They're less expensive.

611
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I don't know.

612
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
What's going on?

613
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I had a Boston Bash just sticking out of his forearm.

614
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
That doesn't compute.

615
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That's a fun new glitch.

616
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It's weird.

617
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Quite a game commentary with hints of conversation tonight.

618
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Hits of conversation.

619
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Derma can't hold the conversation while he plays a game.

620
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I can't.

621
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
If I like, I'm like focusing on a video game.

622
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I cannot talk otherwise.

623
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The amount of times you've told me like, oh, like, why aren't you talking?

624
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I usually like, conversate in your stream.

625
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Same reason, right?

626
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
We are in the beam.

627
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
No, like, you've asked me to like, start up conversations before while you're streaming.

628
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And if I like, ask you questions or try and talk to you.

629
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I'd never get a response.

630
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You're just like, not there.

631
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm here.

632
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Let's see how I'm here.

633
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Hey, you want to know nothing right now?

634
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Well, come on.

635
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
What do you want to know?

636
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Auto.

637
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Auto is right behind me.

638
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You're sleeping.

639
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Oh, you.

640
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I guess I can tell the story of how I took him out today.

641
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Tell us.

642
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So I took auto out today.

643
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And we were doing the, doing the, you go to the bathroom dog.

644
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Go outside and pee and poo.

645
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
We all know how to look that slight.

646
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
The bathroom dog.

647
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So I take bathroom dog out.

648
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And we're doing fine.

649
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
He pees.

650
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
He poos.

651
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And I noticed that there's like, there's some sticky things all over his feet.

652
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
We were walking around like in the wooded area.

653
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You.

654
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Well, we were like in like a wooded path.

655
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
So he gets, ends up getting these, he must have stepped in like sap or something.

656
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Like tree sap out of no idea what the hell he could have stepped in.

657
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
He was climbing the trees, yes.

658
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And he, uh, my shit, all right.

659
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I gotta pay attention.

660
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I'm getting, I'm getting critical crate.

661
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Doesn't that count?

662
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I didn't get creepers.

663
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
All right, I was, I was kidding.

664
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So he ended up having these like flippers of leaves all over him.

665
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
He was, it was as if he was going to go scuba diving.

666
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
He had leaf scuba flippers for every single foot.

667
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And he was just like, chuch, chuch, chuch.

668
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Walking really awkwardly.

669
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And I was like, what the hell is this dog doing?

670
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And finally, I like, I looked at his hands and they were,

671
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
the ground was coming up with him.

672
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So I spent like at least 20 to 30 minutes cleaning this dog's hands and feet.

673
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And the feet.

674
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And he didn't know the hell is your dog, Dormit.

675
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
That guy just died.

676
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It might have been like a homeless man.

677
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
You found in a leaf pile.

678
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah, I confused a homeless man with a dog.

679
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
He spent 30 minutes cleaning him and there was a homeless man under it instead of your dog.

680
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I don't think that's what happened.

681
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Dog hands.

682
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It was very, it was very odd.

683
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And it's not the first time that's happened before.

684
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
That has, that's happened to this dog like at least one or two times before.

685
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I think your dog is part gecko.

686
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I don't know, he's got really, he's got really sticky hands.

687
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Sticky feet.

688
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I mean hands.

689
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Sorry.

690
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Well, both.

691
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
If you could give your dog one superpower, what would it be?

692
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I would put money obviously.

693
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
One superpower?

694
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That's actually a really, really tough question.

695
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Because one could be like poop gold.

696
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
No, me and poop it all.

697
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
There you go.

698
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
No, we're rephrasing the question.

699
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Your superpower also has to be a power that like someone from the X-Men or like a real superhero has.

700
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
You can't change their poop.

701
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
No one has.

702
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
What?

703
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Come on.

704
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It needs to have a superpower and it needs to be like a real superpower and not a real-changing power.

705
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Okay, because he has weird poops, okay?

706
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
No.

707
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Professor X.

708
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
He's just a powerfully chicken.

709
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
You're making fun of handicapped people.

710
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
For what?

711
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
For Professor X is like the most intelligent telepathic mind ever.

712
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yeah.

713
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I would just be like auto.

714
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Can he understand English?

715
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Does he have these powers?

716
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But I can't ask him to do anything.

717
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Whatever power it is, you have to pick which power you want him to have.

718
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Why is this popular?

719
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
1,000 viewers?

720
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Question mark?

721
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Team Fortress 2.

722
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Oh my gosh.

723
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Why is this popular?

724
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I mean, if he had Professor Xavier's power, he still wouldn't be able to talk because his power isn't to talk.

725
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
His power is connecting minds with other people.

726
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So like maybe auto could like be in your head.

727
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Then I would have the beast power because then the dog could talk and it'd still be a beast.

728
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I don't know.

729
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I'd probably give him like...

730
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Is there a character that can...

731
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Beast is a good choice because he's extremely like smart and he can like move around and he's...

732
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Would the dog be as big as Beast?

733
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Does the dog...

734
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
He would slowly start turning like a blue and growing.

735
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Like, would he be like huge?

736
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
He would be huge, but he'd start mutating I guess.

737
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Or you could have like a night crawler dog.

738
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
He could let himself outside.

739
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
No, he'd just keep teleporting after everything and then he'd be...

740
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Fantastic four?

741
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
What the fuck is...

742
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
How many blue people are on this other team?

743
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Fantastic four, stretchy guy.

744
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I want a stretchy dog.

745
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
No.

746
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
No, no.

747
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
There was just seven people there with no other red two people on this team.

748
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I put my foot down on a stretchy dog.

749
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I want a stretchy dog.

750
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Even that or the flame on, guys.

751
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
It would just stretch it.

752
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Yeah, come on.

753
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It's a bed and poop in the bed.

754
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
The human flame.

755
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Get his name right.

756
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Fucking idiot.

757
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Oh my god.

758
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
What's the name of the guy who stretches?

759
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Doctor Doom.

760
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Oh, not Doctor Doom.

761
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Oh, fingerless.

762
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
This is a fantastic, that's his name.

763
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It's a stupid name.

764
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It is a stupid power and it's a stupid character.

765
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
The human torch on the human flame.

766
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
The human flame.

767
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah, you fucking idiot.

768
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Fucking idiot.

769
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
The flame.

770
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
The fauverin time.

771
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I hate the fantastic four.

772
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
The worst of yours.

773
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
What?

774
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Why?

775
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
What am I stuck on?

776
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
What the fuck is happening with my life?

777
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Don't be me, why.

778
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
The face.

779
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
The name is The Thing, darling.

780
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
He's covered with rocks.

781
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I didn't know what does that.

782
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Gumby boy.

783
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And gummy boy.

784
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Dude, Gumby.

785
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Give me those gumby.

786
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Cool, players.

787
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
But he's not an X-man.

788
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
So does a cap.

789
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
All right.

790
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
If I could be an X-Men.

791
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Toad.

792
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I think if I wanted to be in all the movies, I'd be willing to.

793
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I don't want to.

794
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
You want to have the best exclusive deals.

795
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I feel like no matter how good your power is, the less screen time you're getting.

796
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Because that guy who could run really fast and slow time pretty much.

797
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
He was cut out because he made everything too easy.

798
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
But we'll read that.

799
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yeah, he had to do a really attractive man.

800
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Really vascular.

801
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
His power was too good.

802
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I'd be into that.

803
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You could live for a really long time.

804
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
What about this?

805
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Can't Jean Gray end the planet if she really wanted to?

806
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Yes, why she dies.

807
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Yeah, but she can't control it because she can't.

808
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
You don't want to be too rare.

809
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
What the fuck really?

810
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Yeah, and people get mad at you for using her in Marvel.

811
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
You call you a scrub.

812
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Yeah, maybe like four years ago on anyone here.

813
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
How come every time I go to a class, it turns into four of them.

814
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
That's where you go.

815
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I like to spy.

816
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Maybe a try spy.

817
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Pixelver was cut out because of copyright issues.

818
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
You serious?

819
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Who owns somebody else own quickseller?

820
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It wasn't the Avenger movie for some reason.

821
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Instead of the X-Men movies.

822
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Did I find this suspicious?

823
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
That's weird.

824
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And Scarlet Witch, which is a terrible name.

825
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Jesus, what the hell is I think in there?

826
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
What the fuck was I doing?

827
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
No, I was staying spy.

828
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I was just dumb.

829
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Isn't there actually supposed to be a new season of heroes coming out?

830
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Is it a spin-off?

831
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Yeah, where is it an actual hero?

832
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I think they killed some of the characters because actors aren't returning,

833
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
but heroes is hitting a new season, which I really don't think was around.

834
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
That show is so old.

835
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
The show is so random.

836
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
An in-read.

837
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
There's no continuity between anything.

838
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Each season, it's like, oh, here's a different timeline.

839
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I hear that somebody made pancakes in it.

840
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
That is the best scene in the whole show.

841
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And that makes me like, I like love that.

842
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
So that scene is one of my favorite moments in television.

843
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
That's why I mentioned it because your voice did that little thing.

844
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Wow, I got this one right.

845
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
You know, it doesn't seem siloer make pancakes for a son.

846
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
He's just like missing out.

847
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Give me the water.

848
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Who the spy has the beer stuck on him?

849
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
That's pretty funny.

850
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
It's like stuck to his head.

851
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Oh, I get to ask me, I'm a sniper on this team.

852
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
How dare you try to kill me?

853
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I want you to hype both.

854
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I want you to be better call Saul.

855
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I want it.

856
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I want it in my life.

857
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I want to call Saul.

858
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Did that just fucking have it?

859
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
He got turred.

860
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
He wasn't even trying to hit me and he cripped me in the face and I instantly died.

861
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Derma, do you watch that show?

862
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Better call Saul with Gritio.

863
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yes.

864
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yes, yeah.

865
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I hope I hope I wasn't really like a fan of how they ended that last episode.

866
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Not me neither.

867
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And I called it and you didn't believe.

868
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I really didn't believe it, yeah.

869
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I've already forgiven them who don't need to.

870
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Are you okay?

871
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Maybe I haven't forgiven them.

872
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
There are waffles on pancakes.

873
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
That's alright, that's a really late response.

874
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You probably like looked it up.

875
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I would have liked to have seen like what dragged out kind of like why that happened to him.

876
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Kind of thing.

877
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
No one knows what you're talking about.

878
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
You can't see me.

879
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
You can't see me.

880
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah, no spoilers.

881
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Spoilers?

882
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I was like that's an episode I don't pay attention.

883
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
If I'm going to be like not pay attention.

884
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Never once in a while.

885
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Last moment you've paid attention.

886
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,000
When I was just playing Spire right there that last life I was paying attention to everything people were saying.

887
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And I just walked around and just swung at medics spaces.

888
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Truck truck. Can you come in the call and laugh?

889
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Probably he has a new horse fight.

890
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You always take me seriously.

891
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I'm booting you.

892
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
You're dead.

893
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And he got me.

894
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I thought I had this on for some dumb reason.

895
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
So you're talking understand language that's what you want it.

896
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
You just screaming.

897
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Oh, die. Does he understand that you're playing a game?

898
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Wouldn't he understand context?

899
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Would he understand context or what?

900
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I don't know. Maybe he missed out on the context because he doesn't know what video games are.

901
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Like he hasn't learned that yet because he just came smart and now you're screaming die and he would like run away.

902
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Oh, damn it.

903
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I know.

904
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I was just popular.

905
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I was talking about dogs with superpowers.

906
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
That's a good question.

907
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Whenever you're in like in like when you're a small infant child, the question is always like, oh, what's super proud would you have?

908
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,000
What's the proud word you dog have because you have to consider you're not you're not direct troll that.

909
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It's very important.

910
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I think that's a question that not enough people know their answer to.

911
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Good point.

912
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Yeah, you can't answer these questions like who are you?

913
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
What's the point?

914
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Why are you even around?

915
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Why don't you have a dog?

916
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Yeah, why don't you have a dog, dude?

917
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Get with it.

918
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
How is the invasion update?

919
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
You're watching it.

920
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:37,000
My dog would be crypto the dog because he could both talk and he had all the powers of Superman, which are you could pretty much just pull out of your pocket and just pick one.

921
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Mine would be the super horse.

922
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
There was also like the power of the Superman, but it was a horse, but it couldn't talk.

923
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
It's just like a horse.

924
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
It's not real thing.

925
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Yes.

926
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I called a unicorn.

927
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
No.

928
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
There's like in love with a chick, too.

929
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
It's like, oh, I thought I could tell her I could how I feel.

930
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
There's like a horse.

931
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Do unicorns have this?

932
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Dude, that's a deep level of usually stuff.

933
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I know.

934
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Where'd he go?

935
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I can tell that guy just come.

936
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Comics, man. They're crazy.

937
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
They are crazy.

938
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Wow.

939
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I didn't hit them.

940
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Friedjack.

941
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I guess he got a fancy spellbook on.

942
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Comment to the super horse.

943
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Was that his name?

944
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
That sounds right.

945
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
That sounds really right.

946
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I don't know if I want my dog to have like Wolverine powers because that wouldn't he like

947
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
not ever mind.

948
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Wolverine's not immortal, right?

949
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
He just can't like die, right?

950
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
He feels immediately like after like a day or something.

951
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
He has a skeleton and Adam Mattinger.

952
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
That isn't part of his power.

953
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
So you're talking about that.

954
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I know you're going to say that.

955
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
That's not part of his power.

956
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Because it was built into him.

957
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
You're right.

958
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
That's why I explained it.

959
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Because Dermal would be your dog would just have like long nails, which is

960
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
sabertooth's power.

961
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Yeah.

962
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
That's the worst power ever.

963
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I don't know how they like tried to like have him be cool and also fight Wolverine.

964
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Toad.

965
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I have a long fingernails.

966
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Toad.

967
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Toad is cool.

968
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
He is cool.

969
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
He's because he's like the reject one.

970
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Yeah, but he's toad.

971
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Toad doesn't like really do anything.

972
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
He just kind of has a long tongue and jumps around.

973
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Yeah, he can shoot mucus out of his throat.

974
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Think of all the things you could do with mucus and a long tongue.

975
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I know what you can do with a lot of mucus.

976
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You have been real sick.

977
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
It sucks.

978
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
That's what he do.

979
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
You just like nothing.

980
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
You can't, what are you going to do with mucus?

981
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I'm going to do with mucus.

982
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I'm going to do it.

983
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I'm just going to do it.

984
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I'm just going to do it.

985
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
beni don't people.

986
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
That's what he does.

987
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
That's what he does.

988
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Did it.

989
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Did it.

990
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
It didn't like burn people, or is that.

991
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Oh, no.

992
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
No, it's burned people.

993
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
It's bad.

994
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
It's a real disgusting.

995
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm going to hit him with lightning.

996
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It's in the worst line in any movie ever.

997
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
when it's checked by lightning.

998
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
The same thing that happens to everything else.

999
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:19,000
You got to remember the Wolverine does have his claws even without the metal they

1000
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
were just made of bone instead.

1001
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
For no reason.

1002
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Those bone claws are like dumb.

1003
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Who is he the bone guy?

1004
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Saber 2.

1005
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
The bone, he had the extra long fingernails.

1006
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
That's what I'm saying.

1007
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Well, I want Darwin's power so there.

1008
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
He could like change his body into any shape.

1009
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
He wanted.

1010
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
How did I not hit this guy?

1011
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Like, are we fucking for real?

1012
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
He was on screen for like 10 minutes and he died.

1013
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Did you just say you changed your body into a penis?

1014
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
That's what anyone would do.

1015
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Not me.

1016
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Wow.

1017
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Okay.

1018
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Maybe I would if it was funny.

1019
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
They're really funny.

1020
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
It would be really funny.

1021
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I will use the ones.

1022
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
My family wasn't there.

1023
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I think there's been a bit of a pain in the ass.

1024
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I'm going to put that on.

1025
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Merrill, what's your favorite dog breed?

1026
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
What'd you say?

1027
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I got his almost 60.

1028
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Yeah, what's your favorite dog breed?

1029
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
They all have good qualities about them.

1030
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
They're all different.

1031
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
They're lovely.

1032
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I think a husky is like the most attractive dog.

1033
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
How to crit.

1034
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
What did you say?

1035
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
A husky is pretty nice looking, yeah.

1036
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
They're like jerks.

1037
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
You wouldn't actually want one.

1038
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Wow.

1039
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
His chat has a husky and is like upset that you said that.

1040
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Hey, my friend had huskies growing up.

1041
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
They were jerks.

1042
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Oh, so all huskies are jerks.

1043
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Yeah, pretty much.

1044
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I watched Animal Planet.

1045
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
What was your favorite show on Animal Planet?

1046
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,000
The show about dog breeds, obviously.

1047
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Is there a centred down here?

1048
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
There's probably a centred down here, right?

1049
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Has to be, right?

1050
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I guess not.

1051
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
No all the dog lower, OK?

1052
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Huskies are trained to pull things.

1053
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
So in order for her to stop them from being crazy and just

1054
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
barking all day long, she would have to get on roller blades

1055
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
and never huskies toer around the block.

1056
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I guess I guess.

1057
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It just seemed like really badly trained dogs.

1058
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
No, it's in their genetics.

1059
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Think about that.

1060
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Dogs, though, if you have a dog that's not trained well,

1061
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
dog will lead us.

1062
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Yes, I am.

1063
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,000
It's hard to really, it doesn't matter what the breed is.

1064
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
If you have a dog that's not that well trained,

1065
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
they're probably always going to be an issue unless you

1066
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
can fix it, right?

1067
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I don't.

1068
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
But their plan otherwise.

1069
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Yeah, I have to hit them often.

1070
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Hey, what the hell?

1071
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
No.

1072
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Get in there.

1073
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Deposit all 40 in these.

1074
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
That increases the dog's aggression.

1075
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
FYI.

1076
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Totally shit.

1077
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
This is a lot of beers going in here.

1078
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It also make me hate you.

1079
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Wow, that was a lot of things deposited.

1080
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Is that beer icon new?

1081
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Yeah, I don't remember that from last time.

1082
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
There were a lot of people saying, what do I even do with the beers?

1083
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
So I guess there's a floating beer and arrow icon now.

1084
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Yeah, they made it in like two minutes.

1085
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Beer goes here.

1086
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Best show on Animal Planet was the show about trying to prove Bigfoot

1087
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
was real.

1088
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
But at the end of the show, they were just like,

1089
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
we didn't find any evidence, but he could still be out there.

1090
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Dude, you just described shows on the Discovery Channel

1091
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
and the History Channel and Animal Planet.

1092
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You know, Bigfoot could be out there still.

1093
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
No.

1094
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
No.

1095
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
You never know.

1096
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Some of the episodes are cool.

1097
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Yes, I do know.

1098
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Like what was the show called, like Monster Hunter?

1099
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Try.

1100
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Monster Hunter, try.

1101
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Are you talking about a cartoon?

1102
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
No, the actual show.

1103
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
It was like a Monster Hunter show on History Channel.

1104
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Like they, I forgot what it was called, exactly.

1105
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Some of the shows were just like so bad.

1106
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Like the Bigfoot one.

1107
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
That show did an episode on the Leopard Conds.

1108
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
That's every Bigfoot thing ever.

1109
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
They tried to find the Leopard Conds.

1110
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
So we paid them to do it.

1111
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Mermaid.

1112
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
They were like.

1113
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:47,000
They were like.

1114
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
They were like, I'm getting from ear to ear for the entire

1115
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
episode.

1116
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Like, yep.

1117
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
We're looking for lepreth grants.

1118
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I'm getting such a big paycheck.

1119
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Leopard con.

1120
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
We didn't find any, but they could still be real.

1121
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
We're looking for real.

1122
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
We're all getting straight, bro.

1123
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
We're looking for real.

1124
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Yeah.

1125
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Yeah, we're going to win anyways.

1126
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
There's no reason to just go on Mate.

1127
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Like a spree right now.

1128
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Oh, come on.

1129
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Come on.

1130
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Come on.

1131
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Come on.

1132
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Come on.

1133
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Come on.

1134
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Whoa.

1135
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
It's getting scary.

1136
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Hurry up.

1137
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
All right.

1138
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I don't think we've got to fill this map.

1139
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Jersey devil is real, by the way.

1140
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I heard a story about this guy that's already got him.

1141
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
This guy.

1142
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
They didn't episode on the Jersey devil.

1143
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
And they said we'd go look for it, but we're too scared.

1144
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:44,000
We already know what's real.

1145
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
So we're not going to go to Leopard Conds.

1146
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Yeah.

1147
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Jeremy, probably need to stop staring at the UFO

1148
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
when you're in the beam.

1149
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I'm a bug, dude.

1150
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
You know, like moths, I just have to stare at it.

1151
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
What's the one that I didn't play?

1152
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
The arena map.

1153
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Brie.

1154
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It's a briar buyer.

1155
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Brie, I don't know.

1156
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Can we have a serious talk about your overlay?

1157
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
What's wrong with it?

1158
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Can I make you one?

1159
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Can it be anything else?

1160
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
If you want to make me an overlay,

1161
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
it better still have that guy's face.

1162
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Why?

1163
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Why did you just need grove on it?

1164
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Did you just ask by grove a cast to be on there?

1165
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Yes.

1166
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Huh.

1167
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I don't even know where to start.

1168
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
First of all, it just needs to be animated.

1169
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
So people know it's not like offline.

1170
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I don't know if it's talking about animated shit.

1171
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I am an animator.

1172
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I could animate the grove or face.

1173
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
You animate me grover.

1174
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I could.

1175
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Drinking a milk and being like, drink your milk, catch.

1176
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
No, because that would be a mute reference.

1177
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
That's a mute reference?

1178
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Yes.

1179
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
He says it all the time.

1180
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Well, that's a grover top of the drink.

1181
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
My milk and I drank it.

1182
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
He was on the top of the drink.

1183
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I don't think you can add sound file to it, Journal.

1184
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
What do you mean?

1185
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
No, it's a word bubble.

1186
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Add sound to what?

1187
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Forget about it.

1188
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I can envision this in my head.

1189
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Do you give any superpower to your toilet?

1190
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
What would it be?

1191
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Yeah.

1192
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
The power to there is no superpower.

1193
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
You give your toilet.

1194
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I would give my toilet in mind reading power.

1195
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
So it wouldn't know one to open and close because I need it.

1196
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Yeah, unless it was like an asshole.

1197
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Who cares, though?

1198
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
You can just that that's a one second solution.

1199
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
This is how lazy story is.

1200
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
You that lazy?

1201
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
No, I just think it would be cool to have a telepathic toilet.

1202
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Maybe like everyone's a while.

1203
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I don't want my toilet to be sentient.

1204
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
That's fucked up.

1205
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
That's some real peewee Hermann.

1206
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Like, dude, you're talking about you want your toilet to be like,

1207
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
oh, it has like superpowers or has like sentience.

1208
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Oh, please, shit in that thing.

1209
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,000
You shit in that thing.

1210
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
You want that to like know what you're doing?

1211
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
No, if I had a sentient toilet, I would do something.

1212
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Dude, what did you eat?

1213
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It would just be like, oh god, make it quick.

1214
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
OK, just go.

1215
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
God, dude.

1216
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:23,000
And then you'd flush and he'd be like, oh, no.

1217
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
You just forced me to swallow that.

1218
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
You fucking monster.

1219
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
And then you'd get out of the room.

1220
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
You'd close the door and you'd be like, fuck, my god.

1221
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
No, I would say to you.

1222
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I would get you.

1223
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Nothing you can do to stop me.

1224
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
And I'll be back later.

1225
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Does it like doesn't have arms?

1226
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
They can't move.

1227
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And I'm going to go eat the cutoff fish.

1228
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
What if they puke down here?

1229
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
That's a thing.

1230
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
But it would just be like crying at night.

1231
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
You'd be like trying to sleep and it would just be like, god.

1232
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
It's the most disgusting conversation we've ever had.

1233
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
God, no, you never.

1234
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
You've talked about like.

1235
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
He'd rip out of the wall and start fighting you.

1236
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Oh, my god.

1237
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You've talked about like bunched up packages and men's pants.

1238
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
And how like how noticeable it was.

1239
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
This conversation is like a weirder.

1240
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Bunched up package.

1241
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Yeah, see?

1242
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
You thought it was funny then, too.

1243
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Just listen to what you just said.

1244
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Bunched up packages.

1245
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I'm very funny.

1246
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah.

1247
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah.

1248
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I just think that's funny on its own.

1249
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Really ergonomic.

1250
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I'll draw a grover for you with a bunched up package

1251
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
like animated for your overlay.

1252
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
What the?

1253
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Oh, shit.

1254
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
That's so messed up.

1255
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Grover.

1256
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And it's talking to us toilet.

1257
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Oh, boy.

1258
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
No, I would not want to have superpowers.

1259
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I'm watching this while eating.

1260
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Fuck.

1261
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I'm sorry.

1262
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Sorry, Bonzi.

1263
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Have I played the game yet?

1264
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I'm like, have I done anything?

1265
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I don't think you've gotten a kill.

1266
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I'm dead serious.

1267
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Have I?

1268
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Did I just sit in the spawn?

1269
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I don't know.

1270
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I really have no idea if I was just sitting in the spawn.

1271
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Probably happened.

1272
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Oh, maybe you had to spectate this round.

1273
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Because like 12 people have to spectate.

1274
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Oh, we've got a lot of people.

1275
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Oh, that is next level.

1276
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
This changes the topic of something nicer.

1277
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Like what's your favorite plant?

1278
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Jesus.

1279
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
What's your favorite plant?

1280
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Why am I not going to hit me in the face right there?

1281
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Plant from Nukulu Throne.

1282
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Is it good answer?

1283
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
My favorite plant is probably Snapdragon.

1284
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
What?

1285
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Snapdragon.

1286
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
You don't know what a Snapdragon is?

1287
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
You answer that so quick.

1288
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Because that's my favorite plant.

1289
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I know what my favorite plant is.

1290
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Do you know what your favorite plant is?

1291
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
No.

1292
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
What her plant is, are.

1293
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Plant.

1294
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Plant.

1295
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Oh.

1296
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:24,000
My favorite plant is Snapdragon.

1297
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I can't get over it.

1298
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I can't get over the toilet thing.

1299
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
God.

1300
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
It's going to be with me for a while.

1301
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
The guy in chat asks a really good question.

1302
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
It's the toilet clog.

1303
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Is it choke and die?

1304
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
No.

1305
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
They have to pee in a dead toilet.

1306
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Jesus.

1307
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Say what chapter already.

1308
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
All right.

1309
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Now, let's what we're going to spectate.

1310
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
We're going to spectate.

1311
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Thought Jermy would say sunflower.

1312
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
You have to give your toilet.

1313
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
That is a very good point.

1314
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Very good point.

1315
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Have you mentioned sunflower before or something?

1316
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
No, no.

1317
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Like, do they're just really, really big and cool looking?

1318
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Hmm.

1319
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It's personally, always you pretty well.

1320
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Impress us, Shell.

1321
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Get this.

1322
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Come on.

1323
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Get that sniper.

1324
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
That's you or kill.

1325
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
You've got to get that.

1326
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Get this.

1327
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
The whole team right here.

1328
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
They don't even know.

1329
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
We're going to spectate.

1330
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
All right.

1331
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
This guy.

1332
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
All right.

1333
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
No, we're going to.

1334
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Okay.

1335
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
You got this.

1336
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
You're going to go in there.

1337
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
And you're going to be the laggy guy in this whole server.

1338
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
He got somebody.

1339
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
He got him.

1340
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
The chat is being silly.

1341
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
He.

1342
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
No.

1343
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Tell Star that they do make toilets with sensors that will lift the lid when you get near

1344
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
it.

1345
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I like the toilets.

1346
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I've never going to try one.

1347
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Go and go and new plan toilet that like spits in your asshole.

1348
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Oh, my God.

1349
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I'm really curious.

1350
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
That's one apartment.

1351
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
The one apartment we looked at had one of those toilets.

1352
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
It did?

1353
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
It did.

1354
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Yeah, that one that had the fish smells that had that had one of those toilets.

1355
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Oh, gross.

1356
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I'm so glad we didn't go there then.

1357
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
You have to do it.

1358
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Yes, you do.

1359
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
You have to do it at least once.

1360
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
You do.

1361
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
You really do.

1362
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
You really do.

1363
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
You really do.

1364
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Oh.

1365
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Oh.

1366
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
We got it.

1367
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Shaking that off there.

1368
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I'm so glad I avoided that.

1369
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I know.

1370
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I don't think I mean fish apartment.

1371
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I don't know.

1372
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I'm trying to think of like if it wasn't Snapdragon.

1373
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Cactus.

1374
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And I'm not talking like the little cactus that your doctor has in his office.

1375
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I'm talking about the big ass Wily Coyote cactus.

1376
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
The Super Mario cactus with the arms that stick up.

1377
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
That's my second favorite plan.

1378
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I like how long between talking about plants you brought it back up again.

1379
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
So sunflower is number three.

1380
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Nice walk to right into a heavy by the way.

1381
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Oh, you're a love walk right.

1382
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Snaptragons and cactus and he's a really big plank guy.

1383
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
How do redwoods factor in your plant discussion?

1384
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Redwoods?

1385
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Yes.

1386
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
The tree redwood?

1387
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Yes, it is a plant actually.

1388
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
We had the largest plant on the planet.

1389
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Yeah, that's what I think about them.

1390
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I thought that would have been.

1391
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Well, it's your favorite animal.

1392
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Non domestic animal.

1393
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
You're going to say like dog.

1394
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I got it.

1395
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I'm a good one.

1396
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
That's a really good one.

1397
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Do you have an armadillo as a pet if you could?

1398
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
If it was like legal and they weren't like a wild animal maybe.

1399
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Okay.

1400
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Yes.

1401
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
And it has the flame on powers.

1402
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Just get a headshot.

1403
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Like this thing.

1404
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
What the human flame?

1405
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Do you tell me it's got human flame powers?

1406
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I need to stop talking so I can get a kill.

1407
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
It's so many lengths of fiction.

1408
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
One for any toilet.

1409
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
That's not I would not want that toilet.

1410
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Can I should I click on it or no?

1411
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Yes, should.

1412
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Okay.

1413
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
You're almost should click on it too.

1414
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Ew, what the fuck?

1415
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Oh my god.

1416
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
That guy again.

1417
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Ew.

1418
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Give me a break.

1419
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Ew, ew, ew.

1420
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Oh, I am seeing that.

1421
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
It all of my dreams.

1422
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I'm not clicking on any of that shit.

1423
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Ah.

1424
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
It's terrible.

1425
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I'm clicking on it.

1426
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
She's overreacting.

1427
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
She's trying to get more subscribers.

1428
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Never clicking on that.

1429
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Don't try to get me to click on that.

1430
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Who linked that?

1431
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
No, it's really it's not gory.

1432
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
It's not.

1433
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Okay.

1434
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
All right.

1435
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
This is a G-rated stream.

1436
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
More like a bunch of.

1437
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Yes.

1438
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
More like a bunch of.

1439
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
No G-rated, audience stream.

1440
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Okay.

1441
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I don't want to see that shit.

1442
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Get that fucking dumb shit out of here.

1443
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
G-rated.

1444
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Come on, guys.

1445
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Is you saying the word shit?

1446
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
That's what Jokey's trying to make.

1447
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
He really stressed it.

1448
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,000
You really want to make sure people call onto the joke there.

1449
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Okay.

1450
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Can I play again?

1451
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
No.

1452
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I'm going to show you guys my.

1453
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Why are you playing arena on the stream?

1454
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Because it gives me, you know why?

1455
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Because it gives me a chance to talk.

1456
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
You're always dead.

1457
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
When I'm dead, I can just be like, all right, let's talk about plants.

1458
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
All right.

1459
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Did you see my last round?

1460
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I got like three or four people in the last round.

1461
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
But you like surviving arena.

1462
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
It's different.

1463
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I did you just see the round that I just played in scout?

1464
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I got like four people.

1465
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Who's your favorite?

1466
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Are you watching the stream?

1467
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Right now you're equipping a sniper loadout.

1468
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I know.

1469
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Isn't it different than wacky?

1470
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Or...

1471
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Hotspin sniper.

1472
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
You know it.

1473
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Say we did it.

1474
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Look at that.

1475
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
You know it sucks.

1476
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I was the final shot.

1477
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I knew it would be a good shot.

1478
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I knew it would be a good shot.

1479
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I had some cool enemies.

1480
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
That's some cool designs.

1481
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
What was it for?

1482
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
PlayStation.

1483
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
The PS.

1484
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
The PS.

1485
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Nice.

1486
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
PS1 and PS2 and PS3.

1487
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
The PS1.

1488
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
The first.

1489
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:45,000
There were a lot of cool games for PS1.

1490
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
That was the most random thought.

1491
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Hell, it was going on with this guy.

1492
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I felt pretty confused.

1493
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I was confused as you could be.

1494
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I'm not sure.

1495
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I blamed that on that medic.

1496
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
That was civilianing around.

1497
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I probably would have...

1498
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
If I didn't freak out at that, that was weird.

1499
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
What is more than a good PlayStation 1 classics?

1500
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I was talking to Ashley the other day about a vagrant story.

1501
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
That's not one of my old time favorites.

1502
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I'm a little less unknown like JP Koon.

1503
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Let's watch this guy.

1504
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
The old Resident Evil games were pretty good.

1505
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Wow, did we just both?

1506
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Wow, Jinx you owe me a Coca-Cola classic.

1507
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Yeah, I'll fuck you.

1508
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Oh.

1509
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
You did not just say that, did you?

1510
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
On my G-rated stream.

1511
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
It would have been a G-rated thing.

1512
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Like, you know, they don't show anything.

1513
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
It's just like a fight.

1514
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:12,000
On my G-rated stream, you're going to bring that up.

1515
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Thanks.

1516
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Okay, well, moving on.

1517
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
You're okay, the old...

1518
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
The old, um...

1519
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I figured what they were called.

1520
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Turn-based mech games.

1521
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
It was like, it wasn't mech warrior.

1522
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Turn-based mech game.

1523
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Yeah, those are really good.

1524
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Did I do it in time?

1525
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Apparently not.

1526
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
No, the mech warrior?

1527
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I think it was mech warrior.

1528
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
That was a old PC game.

1529
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Is that no gear?

1530
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:56,000
It has like seven games.

1531
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Oh.

1532
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Front mission.

1533
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
That guy got it.

1534
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
That guy wins.

1535
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
You have to give them all.

1536
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Okay, why is this shooting out regular pills?

1537
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Everyone who said Front Mission was a winner.

1538
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
There's a lot of weird shit going on in this server.

1539
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
This is the Iron Bomber.

1540
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Why is this shooting regular...

1541
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Regular demo mails.

1542
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
That's just gonna be tough.

1543
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Okay.

1544
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Alrighty then.

1545
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Should shoot chickens.

1546
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
What does it do?

1547
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Armored core as well, actually.

1548
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
You know Dark Souls people.

1549
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Armored core.

1550
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
It's quite the good game.

1551
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I do remember Armored core.

1552
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I would actually freaking love to like PvP you in Armored core.

1553
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
It'd probably fun.

1554
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
You should get it.

1555
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
I'll come over.

1556
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I would have to unlock all this stuff too.

1557
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
You have to make a neck.

1558
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
But then I play...

1559
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
You are coming over though, right, Jeremy?

1560
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
You better come over early so we can do something.

1561
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Someday.

1562
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
What?

1563
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
This doesn't sound like a commitment.

1564
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I'll come over like Friday.

1565
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Someday.

1566
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Friday.

1567
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Yeah, I'm gonna go...

1568
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I'm gonna go new server.

1569
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
This time I'm just gonna do...

1570
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
I'm just gonna do like regular payload, man.

1571
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Oh, I'm not convinced.

1572
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Then I'm gonna go to payload upward.

1573
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Oh, they are coming over.

1574
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I'll be there in like three days.

1575
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Is that allowing the traffic? It's gonna take you.

1576
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Yeah, leaving tomorrow.

1577
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
You two non-drivers.

1578
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Hey.

1579
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
You two non-vehicle operators.

1580
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I have my driver's license.

1581
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Actually, that's a good question.

1582
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
What do you...

1583
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
You gonna leave your car in like the train station parking lot for like three days?

1584
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,000
That's what you do when you do something.

1585
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Do they charge you money? Like a lot of money?

1586
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
It's like $1,000.

1587
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Yeah, just like...

1588
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
You come back and it's like full of...

1589
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
$1,000?

1590
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Yeah.

1591
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Yeah, I know.

1592
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
What the heck?

1593
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
What's going on here?

1594
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
All right, we are on a Borneo server now, and I'm gonna play...

1595
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Looks like cart heavy.

1596
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Oh, the heavy that sits on the cart.

1597
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Is Grover still on?

1598
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Shhh. Ow.

1599
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
On Sesame Street?

1600
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Yeah.

1601
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Do they still do Grover segments?

1602
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
You're asking us?

1603
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Yeah.

1604
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
They still do Sesame Street?

1605
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Yeah, did she hear the news?

1606
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Well, it's a news.

1607
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Kermit got a new girlfriend.

1608
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Kermit's taking...

1609
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Wow! Kermit's got a new GF.

1610
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I read like a forum post that's like,

1611
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
it was good because she was like a domestic up user.

1612
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Gladly left her.

1613
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
She was kind of like into...

1614
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
BDS subway.

1615
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Talking about like the...

1616
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Hiya!

1617
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
She did the high up high.

1618
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Yeah.

1619
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Yeah.

1620
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Hiya!

1621
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
A lot of people.

1622
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Frankaz.

1623
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
The old Frankaz.

1624
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
That's a big century can I?

1625
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Cheeseball.

1626
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Let's find out later.

1627
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
That's a good point, Mute Kermit is not Sesame Street.

1628
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
That's a little muffins.

1629
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Wow!

1630
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Okay.

1631
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
It's been a while.

1632
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Now.

1633
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Kermit's on.

1634
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Kermit's on.

1635
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
That's worth three sometimes.

1636
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Is it?

1637
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Yeah.

1638
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Is Sesame Street the gym-handsome company?

1639
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Well, nothing.

1640
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
They're all on play.

1641
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Frank, Frank, that's the connection my brain was making.

1642
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I don't think it was count.

1643
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I'm so if this is count, it doesn't count.

1644
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I'm all caught up in my chill.

1645
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I told you I was a show's.

1646
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Can I do a Kermit impression?

1647
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Everybody has a Kermit impression.

1648
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
You don't need to hear mine.

1649
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Mind here mine.

1650
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Yes.

1651
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Yeah.

1652
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Good.

1653
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Got him.

1654
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Good!

1655
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Ah!

1656
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
You can't have shoving?

1657
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Catch his bell down.

1658
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Ah!

1659
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Oh, man.

1660
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Oh, man.

1661
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:42,000
There's a chapter in a book I read about a lady that hallucinated an image of Kermit the Frog in the corner of her vision for three months.

1662
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
It was just like a stationary image of Kermit.

1663
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
It was just there forever.

1664
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Like overlayed on top of what she was looking at.

1665
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Was she doing some hard drugs?

1666
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
No!

1667
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
It was like a brain condition.

1668
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Really?

1669
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Yeah.

1670
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
That's pretty insane.

1671
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Jeez.

1672
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
She's like, I don't even like that character.

1673
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I don't even watch that show.

1674
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Why am I seeing that?

1675
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,000
It's really weird what like the brain does when you're like not like unconscious mind.

1676
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
It's really weird.

1677
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
She said that sometimes he changed like emotions, but like for no discernible reason.

1678
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
She had a Kermit HUD?

1679
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Pretty much.

1680
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
No, that's what this guy just said.

1681
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
A Kermit HUD.

1682
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Yep.

1683
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
That she couldn't uninstall.

1684
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I do I read it's a book called hallucinations.

1685
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Those are really cool.

1686
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And she wasn't lying.

1687
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Which was proved to how.

1688
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Was there a case where some lady woke up one day and knew French and she never started

1689
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
it and never knew it before?

1690
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
She just like had something happen.

1691
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Wow, that sounded like an internet thing.

1692
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
No, I think that that was a real thing.

1693
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Like somebody like had either a brain condition or something and they ended up like learning a language

1694
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
that they didn't know somehow.

1695
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Swear.

1696
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Sounds legit.

1697
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Somebody somebody will figure that out.

1698
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Sounds legit like a Kermit HUD.

1699
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Kermit HUD?

1700
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Why am I so cynic, dude, when you've seen as much battle as me?

1701
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
This guy's gonna hit me.

1702
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It's not gonna be nice.

1703
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Just go around and have so speed being card heavy, but I'm gonna be punch heavy now.

1704
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,000
It's easy to transition.

1705
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Hey, remember I was gonna be punch heavy just kidding.

1706
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Oh, aw.

1707
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
The person just got a French accent.

1708
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Oh, I see.

1709
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Thank you, Chad.

1710
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,000
So she just woke up one day with a French accent.

1711
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
That she never had before and she just was still interested.

1712
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Yeah, yeah, no, just so just miraculously like God on the news and was popular.

1713
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Fuckin' loser.

1714
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
You don't know.

1715
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
There's like the amount of difference in those two versions of the story.

1716
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Bigfoot can be put bigfoot.

1717
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
They didn't find him last season, but they might next season.

1718
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
There's a million snipers that way.

1719
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I'm gonna go this way.

1720
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I heard that someone had like a big foot hand in like some monk.

1721
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
That he sold it and then they lost it.

1722
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Dramatic.

1723
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Oh, that's weird.

1724
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,000
But if me and you ever hit like rock bottom, like just everything falls apart.

1725
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Do you really want to like dress up and go be bigfoot with me?

1726
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Yeah.

1727
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Like spend our last amount of money on like a bigfoot costume and just go bigfoot.

1728
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
One that costs at least like 15 to $20,000 right?

1729
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
With like fully animatronic face.

1730
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Like the old-missed little move.

1731
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Yeah, and like stills on the legs so you can be like nine feet tall.

1732
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yeah, but we need two of us in the costume for it to work.

1733
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
But yeah, no, no.

1734
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,000
We don't have two Sasquatches so people would feel overwhelmed and they wouldn't attack us.

1735
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Because I mean you shoot you would shoot one Sasquatch, but when you see another one that can come kill you, you second guess it.

1736
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Oh, and like little fake Sasquatch babies so people would like no like one better say we've been Sasquatch babies.

1737
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I can't even comprehend.

1738
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I thought I got backstabbed.

1739
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
We just shot me in a face.

1740
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
German, we're making important plan here.

1741
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I'm already showing it.

1742
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Yes, I will be the two horse person for Halloween this season.

1743
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
No, this is not a two horse.

1744
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
This is your big foot and I'm big foot.

1745
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
We're two big foots together out in the woods.

1746
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
No, that's horrible.

1747
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
We're doing a two horse person.

1748
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Oh my god, I'm not doing that.

1749
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
This isn't going to work.

1750
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Which one of you is going to be the butt?

1751
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I ain't being the butt.

1752
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I'll tell you right now.

1753
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I'm going to be the brain.

1754
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,000
You don't know the Sasquatch and I mean maybe the brain is in the butt.

1755
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
You're going to be like a cat dog Sasquatch with like two ends to it and no butt.

1756
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Two faces.

1757
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
No, you're no.

1758
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Dude.

1759
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Okay, so if we do hit rock bottom, obviously you're not in on the Sasquatch thing.

1760
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
What do we do?

1761
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Do we hit rock bottom?

1762
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Is that what you're asking?

1763
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
There is nowhere else left for us to go.

1764
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Everything is falling apart.

1765
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
They all have blackmail on us.

1766
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
There's footage of us killing nuns or something.

1767
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Well, then we go be a Sasquatch.

1768
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
That's my strength.

1769
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Okay.

1770
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
That's the good part.

1771
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Like people that try and run and like, oh, I don't know what's ever going to catch me.

1772
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
I'm never going to jail.

1773
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
They never tried to be Sasquatch before.

1774
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,000
All right, so I think then I'm going to just go work it.

1775
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I don't know.

1776
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Do I still get to like work it like a regular just to make it hard work or something?

1777
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
No, rock bottom is like if people find you, you will go to jail.

1778
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:39,000
You owe so much money to like the government like you will be in prison to like the IRS wants you.

1779
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Because you could not pay all these debts and everything.

1780
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I would just I would make a video and be like, guys, I've been at rock bottom and I'll tell you how my plan to get out.

1781
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And I would tell like a detailed plan of how I was going to get out of it.

1782
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
And I'd be like, I'm going to do this.

1783
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I'm going to get my life together.

1784
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I'm going to do this.

1785
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And what do you want me to say?

1786
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I want you to say yes, I'll be Sasquatch with you.

1787
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
That's not going to happen unless we do the two Sasquatch.

1788
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I'm not doing two man like you're not going to get a yes from you.

1789
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
You'd be living the rest of your life in a suit with me.

1790
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
You really want that.

1791
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
With a suit with no butt.

1792
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Think about that.

1793
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Heck, I not die.

1794
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I go.

1795
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I really feel like our friendships being tested right now.

1796
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:29,000
No, but we could who said we couldn't get out of the costume.

1797
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Well, someone sees us getting out of the costume and it's all blown.

1798
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
The whole thing is done.

1799
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
We have to live in the woods.

1800
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
We have to live in the woods.

1801
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
What are you saying?

1802
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Yeah, we're pretty much harmits, but we're also dressed as Sasquatches to continue the lore of Sasquatch.

1803
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Maybe like someone will accidentally shoot us too with like a hunting rifle.

1804
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Unless one person in the chat said if you had a male one in a female one, then make one kill you.

1805
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
That's right.

1806
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,000
As you know, there's like hope for the species.

1807
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And then maybe your financial trouble would be solved because you could suit or shot you.

1808
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Get on that car.

1809
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Your Sasquatches don't have rights, but people in the Sasquatches do.

1810
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I have an idea.

1811
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,000
How about we talk about something else?

1812
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
You can talk about living toilets again.

1813
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
How about that?

1814
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
How about we talk about something else?

1815
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Way more important than any of this shit that you guys are bringing out.

1816
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Where the fuck is Grova?

1817
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
If we can't talk about Sasquatches costumes, I think my knight's over here and I have to go.

1818
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
You can do what Sasquatch does.

1819
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Excuse me.

1820
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Alright, how fast do you think I can do the flight, Grova?

1821
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I'm gonna be in fast.

1822
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Yeah, let's talk about that.

1823
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
You could make a YouTube channel pretend to be homeless.

1824
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
But one guy already did that.

1825
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,000
How about I just just keep doing what we do.

1826
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
We're just hanging out playing games and chilling.

1827
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
And then at a number, we hit rock bottom and we...

1828
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:13,000
We just like film themselves laying in dumpsters like, guys, please.

1829
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:18,000
How do you have a computer to upload these videos to a homeless guy?

1830
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Don't ask.

1831
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
You go to the library.

1832
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Don't tell.

1833
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
And then after that, he would upload videos of him eating sushi.

1834
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Like, haha, you mad.

1835
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Fastest clicker in the West.

1836
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
See me in Cookie Clicker.

1837
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
It's trying to be popular.

1838
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I really recommend that a HUD German.

1839
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
A Kermit HUD.

1840
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
It's a picture of Kermit and like, no other information.

1841
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I clicked way too many times and I lost my ability to click.

1842
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
What's your favorite fast food?

1843
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Like McDonald's hamburger world burger king.

1844
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I'm gonna read you a burger burger.

1845
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
What?

1846
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
It's...it's...

1847
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Fingles doesn't really strike me as what you call fast food.

1848
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
That is faster than hell, dude.

1849
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
It is a Fingles bagel.

1850
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Fingles bagel is fast food.

1851
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Oh shit.

1852
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Oh, I don't have it equipped.

1853
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Right now, Fingles bagel is my favorite place to like eat in the world.

1854
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
So then I guess yes.

1855
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Got my wisdom teeth removed.

1856
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Got some oxy so I'm high.

1857
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
What?

1858
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I just fucking...

1859
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
What is...

1860
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Are you serious?

1861
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
That was the quickest my guys ever died turning a corner.

1862
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
They take...

1863
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
They crack eggs beforehand and they put them in a drawer.

1864
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
And they take out the eggs and put them on sandwich.

1865
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Hey, be careful with those things, man.

1866
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
They put eggs in a drawer.

1867
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
What is it?

1868
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
We're doing real talk for a second.

1869
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Be careful with that shit.

1870
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Look shit.

1871
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Like, taking like the medicine from, you know, the dentist when you get wisdom teeth out.

1872
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Be careful.

1873
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Just...

1874
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
There's no...no what it is.

1875
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Be educated on it.

1876
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
And just be...

1877
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Take care of yourself, you know?

1878
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
My mom had to cut me off of my pain, miss.

1879
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
All right, that's the second time that's happened.

1880
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I was like, blah, it's still hurt.

1881
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
That's the second time I've insta died by this guy.

1882
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Shit, no mercy.

1883
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Holy shit.

1884
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I don't know.

1885
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I don't think that one would benefit.

1886
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
What, which hunt, you're the one that you use?

1887
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Just getting some hunt vibes.

1888
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,000
A lot of people over there.

1889
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Dude, cheesecake factory.

1890
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Cheesecake factory blows.

1891
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I know, that's why you're not the perfect man.

1892
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Why? You don't like cheesecake?

1893
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Because he doesn't like it.

1894
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
The cheesecake's gonna cheesecake factory.

1895
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I'm not gonna contest that.

1896
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I haven't tried it. Maybe it is.

1897
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1898
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Back up a second.

1899
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
You just said cheesecake, the cheesecake factory blows.

1900
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,000
And you have not eaten the cheesecake from the cheesecake factory.

1901
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,000
As a restaurant experience where you sit down and eat and have food,

1902
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
it's extremely mediocre.

1903
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Do you remember why it's mediocre?

1904
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Do you know what the name of the restaurant is?

1905
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Cheesecake factory.

1906
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Okay.

1907
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
No, no, do you remember why you didn't like the restaurant?

1908
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Because all of the food is extremely mediocre.

1909
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
No, no, because the decoration was too fancy

1910
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
and it made you feel self-conscious.

1911
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
That's the decoration.

1912
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Okay, I don't like that cheesecake factory usually is a fancy establishment

1913
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
for how bad their food is.

1914
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
How am I goodness?

1915
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
All right.

1916
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Red conning it to have something to do with the actual food.

1917
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
And no, because the first time we went to one,

1918
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
it was really fancy and I was like in a t-shirt and it was weird.

1919
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
So, yes, I was self-conscious.

1920
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I was like, maybe I should have worn some clothes.

1921
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
But you didn't put my pants on me, so I didn't.

1922
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Yep.

1923
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Sorry.

1924
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Well, every day I keep forgetting to put your pants on you.

1925
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I want to just go without...

1926
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I don't think of it like my, uh...

1927
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
It's my favorite restaurant.

1928
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
That's like a chain restaurant.

1929
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I don't know.

1930
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Is it Mose?

1931
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
No, no, no, no.

1932
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I mean like a sys down restaurant.

1933
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
You know what I mean?

1934
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
You're sitting down with friends and family.

1935
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Friends?

1936
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I don't know why I spilled that teleport when we were all the way up here.

1937
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I can't even think of one.

1938
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I feel like I'm in a remote room with two friends.

1939
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Phillips.

1940
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I think is the name of the place.

1941
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Phillips?

1942
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
What?

1943
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Phillips.

1944
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
It's like a seafood place.

1945
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
There's a couple of them.

1946
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I think that would count as a chain.

1947
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
There's one in the airport.

1948
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Whoa, I did not expect there to be that many people here.

1949
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
What about the Phillips?

1950
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
You like it?

1951
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Yeah, Phillips is awesome.

1952
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
That dude, that dude's killed me every time I've been alive.

1953
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Dude, I hop.

1954
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
That's another good answer.

1955
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
This is the first reference to ever liking seafood.

1956
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
That was it lobster macaroni I've ever heard.

1957
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Well, maybe you'll hear me say Phillips is good if we're ever, ever knew him.

1958
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Weird.

1959
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I'm like married to you.

1960
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I didn't, I never heard about this Phillips guy.

1961
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I don't know.

1962
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I don't know where any are besides there's one in Ocean City, Maryland.

1963
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
And I went to a lot.

1964
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I guess it's like rocker with those peets.

1965
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I don't know how to solve.

1966
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
It's a calamari.

1967
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
You like calamari.

1968
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
No.

1969
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:40,000
And what's lobster macaroni?

1970
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
It's too many people.

1971
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Delicious is what it is.

1972
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
It's an Uber.

1973
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Yeah.

1974
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Phillips sold out.

1975
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Only experience I really do have with Phillips is from Ocean City, Maryland, which is probably

1976
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,000
their best establishment just based on a location standpoint.

1977
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I was by a hero here.

1978
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I was in one of us during Ocean City.

1979
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Didn't you go a lot?

1980
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
For every year for three years.

1981
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I went like every year for three years vacation.

1982
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
What the fuck is that?

1983
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:12,000
As a young and because you can't say no to family vacations.

1984
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Yep.

1985
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I want to play on.

1986
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I want to play on upward.

1987
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I'd go again.

1988
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I actually reallyidal like Ocean City.

1989
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Does it have dip in dots?

1990
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Has the Guinness Book of World Records like museum?

1991
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:34,000
There's a window at the beginning where it makes you look at the window or this mirror or something.

1992
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
It's like a mirror.

1993
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
You have to give you some instruction.

1994
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
You have to squint at it or something.

1995
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And when you get all the way to the end of the museum, you come all the way around and you get to look at the idiots in the mirror.

1996
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Because you can see through it.

1997
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Now you're in it for me.

1998
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Thanks.

1999
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Why would I go into Ocean City?

2000
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I wouldn't let you be the person, the idiot, looking in the mirror.

2001
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Oh, that's nice.

2002
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I just said you.

2003
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I just said you.

2004
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I'm going to be on.

2005
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I'm going to be on.

2006
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Oh, yeah, it is Ripley's.

2007
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
We're on.

2008
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Bad water.

2009
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I don't think I ever actually went in it.

2010
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I just heard a lot of people who had gone in it.

2011
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Dip in dots.

2012
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Dip in dots, please.

2013
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Dude, I'm in the ready for a yearly serving.

2014
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,000
My yearly spoonful of dip in dots.

2015
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I cousin ate dip in dots one dot of the time and I just...

2016
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I can't contain myself when I have dip in dots.

2017
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
I'm so fast.

2018
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I know.

2019
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I could eat that all day.

2020
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Remember when we were looking into ordering dip in dots from the internet and the whole day?

2021
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Where you could get it was like...

2022
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
It's that free is dried and everything.

2023
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
In dry ice crates.

2024
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
You end up by like five gallons of...

2025
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Or your birthday party.

2026
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
What's your birthday party?

2027
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Two and a half people.

2028
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
It's so worth it.

2029
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
What's dip in dots?

2030
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
What's dip in dots?

2031
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
It's like three bucks a dot.

2032
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Oh, they are.

2033
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Actually, that ice cream you got.

2034
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
It's also very, very popular ice cream.

2035
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Really?

2036
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
It's comparable to dip in dots.

2037
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:03,000
It's comparable to maybe the best ice cream I've had.

2038
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:08,000
The best ice cream I've ever had probably really was...

2039
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I don't know.

2040
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I want to say it's like...

2041
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:16,000
If you go to like an actual Ben and Jerry's store, not like go to the supermarket and get the pint.

2042
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
If there's like a Ben and Jerry's ice cream place.

2043
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
There.

2044
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:26,000
There are double fudge like fudge chocolate brownie ice cream.

2045
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Oh my god.

2046
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
With a huge fudge chunks.

2047
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:38,000
It's like hitting a brownie in like a milkshake and it's just everything that's amazing about the world in life in general.

2048
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I think very shot, pink very.

2049
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
It's sponsored me.

2050
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
It's cool.

2051
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:51,000
What if like Mr. Pinkberry wouldn't chat right now?

2052
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Did you freak out?

2053
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I would decline the sponsorship and say what's important.

2054
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Because not Pinkberry?

2055
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I'm not gonna sell out to you, Pinkberry.

2056
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I'm gonna have to do a new stuff.

2057
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Is there another century over there?

2058
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
But what if you can have like a personal Pinkberry guy?

2059
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Or just like server to you anytime you want to?

2060
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Yes.

2061
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Yes.

2062
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I'd sell out root for that.

2063
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Oh my god.

2064
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
There's so many people.

2065
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I wish there was a demo right now.

2066
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I can like, I'm hallucinating.

2067
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Dipping dots right now.

2068
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Let's take this in here.

2069
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Just think about sesame chicken instead.

2070
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Oh, I'm now hallucinating that.

2071
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Very suggestible.

2072
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I'm feeling hungry.

2073
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
There's a game going on.

2074
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I might even over it soon.

2075
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I guess I am.

2076
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Dipping dots about the ice cream of the future for 20 years.

2077
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:04,000
This is the team of fucking engineers, holy shit.

2078
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
This is like watching the stirs old streams.

2079
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
You have two medics.

2080
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Everyone is cagga and ing in spawn.

2081
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Everyone's trying to high five you.

2082
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:22,000
This is like when I stop streaming TF2.

2083
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
When are you thinking of dipping dots in Boston?

2084
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Thanks so.

2085
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Oh, he's so low and I didn't get the last couple hits.

2086
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
We got to go to that place one of these days.

2087
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
We get the lobster mac and cheese.

2088
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
We do.

2089
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Lobster mac and cheese.

2090
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I still don't remember the name of that place.

2091
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Oshiana.

2092
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Who did I kill?

2093
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Corporate headquarters for dip and dots is in Massachusetts.

2094
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Is it really?

2095
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Yes.

2096
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
The headquarters of dip and dots.

2097
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
We let's see.

2098
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I'll send them a message and ask for a tour.

2099
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
The corporate office.

2100
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I think they do tours.

2101
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
If they do, let's do it.

2102
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
That would be so fun.

2103
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:13,000
We probably would be only people there over like 12.

2104
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
The dip and dots factory.

2105
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Wait, no, I think this is Rhode Island actually.

2106
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
It's just south of the messages.

2107
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
I was wrong.

2108
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
I didn't see the little dots in the mess.

2109
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I already get our like our hopes up.

2110
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I don't know if this one is right.

2111
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Rhode Island is tiny.

2112
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Actually, yeah, the train does go right.

2113
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
I smell a road trip.

2114
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Road trip.

2115
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Wow.

2116
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Yeah, we're not driving people.

2117
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
We wouldn't understand.

2118
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Let's rent a bus and just pick up.

2119
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Let's rent a bus and pick up the whole chat.

2120
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Yeah.

2121
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
That's a really long bus.

2122
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Oh.

2123
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Would you even be able to turn that bus?

2124
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
It would be like playing a real life game with snake.

2125
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Or you know, that way you can start a biker gang.

2126
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
You know whenever you see like a whole bunch of biker stridebuck.

2127
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
It's like, oh, whoa, who are those guys?

2128
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
That's cool.

2129
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Guys, it's so awesome.

2130
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Please make really loud noises.

2131
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Oh, this is awesome.

2132
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,000
And then we just all be the chat going to dip and dump.

2133
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,000
There is a different place that is 1.3 miles away.

2134
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Go run heavy.

2135
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Run.

2136
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
You have the power of speed.

2137
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Dude.

2138
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I wouldn't recommend people use speed.

2139
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,000
The power of speed.

2140
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
That's a drug, Jabba.

2141
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,000
No, like fast going moving fast speed.

2142
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Yeah, that's how they get you to take it.

2143
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I want to get in here and get everybody with a credit.

2144
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Oh.

2145
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:12,000
This don't work like snake.

2146
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Let's die a re-adults.

2147
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Yeah.

2148
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:23,000
I could actually really go for some fried calamari.

2149
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Yeah, not really a fan of calamari.

2150
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
It's a little too salty for me.

2151
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Yeah, well then get it less salty.

2152
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
I couldn't do that.

2153
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
No, you got to build up your salt tolerance.

2154
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,000
You're like just eat raw chunks of salt every day.

2155
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
You.

2156
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Talking about salt makes me want to be like really lazy and eat like four cups of

2157
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
cup ramen noodle thingy.

2158
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
That's what salt always makes me think of.

2159
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
That's so many of those things are salty.

2160
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
That's a very average.

2161
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Come on.

2162
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
You don't say that.

2163
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Ramen like the cup noodle stuff.

2164
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
It's such a great when it's really cold out.

2165
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
You just sit there and you got the broth and you sip it and ship.

2166
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
You get to the very bottom.

2167
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Stir has seen a mind of a chef which like went back to the origins of ramen.

2168
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:22,000
No, he just talked about why ramen was cool and opened my mind and then I had a really good ramen at that place.

2169
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
We go and it's like my.

2170
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,000
I think it's been blown by a good ramen can be there.

2171
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
But you come and visit we're going to go to that place and we're going to.

2172
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
We are while you're ramen mind.

2173
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Actually, I don't know.

2174
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Maybe on the day we come back.

2175
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
You can go.

2176
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I'll go.

2177
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,000
You will have at least two of the best things you've ever eaten.

2178
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Sounds good.

2179
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I like things that I like to eat.

2180
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Sounds like a point.

2181
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Wow, controversial.

2182
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,000
I like things that I like to eat.

2183
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I actually have a lot of things that I like to eat.

2184
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Wow.

2185
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
There's many things that I like to eat.

2186
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
How old is mine?

2187
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Only a few things that I don't like the rest I would eat.

2188
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Like I don't like shellfish.

2189
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Other than that though.

2190
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I like pretty much everything else.

2191
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,000
I thought you were a spy.

2192
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Like all other food except shellfish.

2193
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Pretty much that's the only thing I would like.

2194
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
I'm like, I don't want that.

2195
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
I don't want that.

2196
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Yes, cargo.

2197
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
It's snail, right?

2198
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Yes.

2199
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I don't know.

2200
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
It'd be tough.

2201
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Oh, shit.

2202
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,000
It's this guy again.

2203
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Is this snail almost like a shellfish?

2204
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
It's like a shell.

2205
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Not fish.

2206
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
It does it.

2207
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
It's just like the whole idea.

2208
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I just don't like it.

2209
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Lobster macaroni.

2210
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Do you like raw bugs?

2211
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Bugs.

2212
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Do you like bugs?

2213
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Also raw.

2214
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,000
They're not cooking these bugs.

2215
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,000
You.

2216
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,000
I swear there was some study.

2217
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I'm going to say that when I don't know what the hell I'm talking about, I'm just going to say that it was.

2218
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:23,000
You were paying so little attention, you went the whole way out of spawn by the way.

2219
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Yes, I did.

2220
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I know.

2221
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
I'm aware of this.

2222
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
I figured that out.

2223
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Don't run shooting rocket.

2224
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Yeah, I'm doing something.

2225
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
My brain is trying to piece together the thing.

2226
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I was just going to say.

2227
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
And I don't even what was it?

2228
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
What was the last three words I said?

2229
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Do you remember?

2230
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
There was some research that.

2231
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,000
I was talking about the same people who.

2232
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
The shellfish.

2233
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
I don't know.

2234
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
It's the kids gone.

2235
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
It's just gone.

2236
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
All right.

2237
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Some of my Bob bugs.

2238
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Oh shit, that's not a shotgun.

2239
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Here was a study that's the end of the story.

2240
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I know that there's a study down at one point.

2241
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
I think it involved shellfish.

2242
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
It'll come to me.

2243
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
I think it involved shellfish.

2244
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
It'll come to me.

2245
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I think your team is winning.

2246
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
I hope so.

2247
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Winning.

2248
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:26,000
That's like what do I like the least favorite thing?

2249
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Winning?

2250
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Yeah.

2251
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Winning.

2252
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,000
It just said it.

2253
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Winning.

2254
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
I'm charging here.

2255
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
I watched that interview live.

2256
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
You know, don't know why.

2257
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
I don't want to.

2258
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
And then the meme came out and I was like,

2259
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I was there, man.

2260
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
It was there when it was winning.

2261
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Oh my god.

2262
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:54,000
This fucking guy.

2263
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Can I have like a brain shield?

2264
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Can I put a thing on my, can I put like a fucking astronaut helmet on me to steal?

2265
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Is this like the medic amulet?

2266
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Yeah, I could really use the medic amulet right now.

2267
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:14,000
That would be fantastic if I had that equipped.

2268
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Studies are usually inherently flawed.

2269
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
I want some of that rummaging.

2270
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Not usually.

2271
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Ah-ha!

2272
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Ooh, I spoke to you.

2273
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Ooh, is Bullin the call?

2274
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Trying to scare that guy.

2275
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Poor Bull, he has no idea.

2276
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Where is Bullin?

2277
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Yeah, what's he doing?

2278
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
What do you think?

2279
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Sleeping.

2280
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Probably playing Rocket League.

2281
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
He's gotten very good at it and he plays it a lot.

2282
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I talked to him earlier.

2283
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
And he said he was going to bed.

2284
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Thank you.

2285
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
But how reliable is he?

2286
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Or reliable in German.

2287
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,000
What is with the telephoto?

2288
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Not a high standard.

2289
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,000
That easy.

2290
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I have to go to the potty.

2291
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:24,000
You view better not.

2292
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
I went to it three times during the stream.

2293
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
That means it's mine.

2294
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,000
I don't want to cause any trouble down there.

2295
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Let's see about that when I talk to him.

2296
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Where is he?

2297
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
One day I'm going to wake up from a dead sleep.

2298
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I should have done the same thing.

2299
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
When you see a spy in a tight corridor like that,

2300
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
you just start swinging in every single direction.

2301
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
And one of you will win.

2302
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
I didn't do that.

2303
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I pulled out the revolver, which was a mistake.

2304
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
That was a smart idea.

2305
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
You just handled it very poorly.

2306
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
He just went into the chaos tab.

2307
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I should have done that.

2308
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I didn't do it.

2309
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
The chaos tab.

2310
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,000
That's right.

2311
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:15,000
I broke my own rule.

2312
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Oh, shit.

2313
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Shit.

2314
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Shit.

2315
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Get well, bomb.

2316
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
He's looking for me.

2317
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
I wasn't a headshot apparently.

2318
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I think based on that scenario, I know that I could beat you in a night fight.

2319
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Oh, come on.

2320
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I wonder how many times this guy has killed me?

2321
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Probably like 12.

2322
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Nice fight.

2323
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
I know escaping through that.

2324
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Nice fight.

2325
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
To be fair, he didn't swing in every single direction.

2326
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,000
He swung in a very specific direction, specifically at you.

2327
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Yeah, that's true.

2328
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I did not.

2329
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I did not do that.

2330
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Dude, let's play the drawing game.

2331
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I've been running for that for months.

2332
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Turn him up.

2333
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Is it a draw game?

2334
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
The drawing game.

2335
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Remember?

2336
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,000
The vomit shield?

2337
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I do remember drawing game.

2338
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
The vomit shield.

2339
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Caja.

2340
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
You were paying attention back then.

2341
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
That was.

2342
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Not anymore.

2343
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Now I'm trying to take out a century with his engineer over here.

2344
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Hey.

2345
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,000
I don't think you just get, I don't think you get how this works.

2346
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Get what?

2347
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,000
You're like flanged spy on a server where everyone's dream's looking.

2348
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I don't think you like get this.

2349
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,000
I can't do anything to combat it anyway, so who cares?

2350
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Who cares, mate?

2351
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Who cares, mate?

2352
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,000
And oh, he knew, he knew, he knew, he knew.

2353
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
I'm co-hosting your stream and not a mod in your chat.

2354
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
I just kept like, blocked by the slow mode.

2355
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:19,000
There's a lot of people who aren't mod in your chat and it's really rubbing on them.

2356
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Rubbing on them.

2357
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Do the drawing game.

2358
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
See?

2359
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
That's what the people are.

2360
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
The drawing game.

2361
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Back to the drawing game.

2362
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Oh, I'll pull out.

2363
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Holy shit, am I going to be able to stab this guy?

2364
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,000
But only 10 seconds.

2365
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Ow.

2366
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
I'm telling my top scorn.

2367
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Stir just said, ow, as he went to the bathroom.

2368
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Maybe he stabbed his twitsy.

2369
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
His twitsy.

2370
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
It's possible.

2371
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,000
It is very possible.

2372
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I like how his soldier looks.

2373
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Looks very wise.

2374
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
It's just the travelosity.

2375
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
No, it's really all of this.

2376
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I see it now again.

2377
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Are you shitin' me, dude?

2378
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,000
What the fuck is this?

2379
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
What is going on?

2380
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Does that guy have like 5500 HP?

2381
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Has the robot fucking medic again?

2382
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
What is going on in this game?

2383
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Wow, that was a voice-up.

2384
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
I don't even know why I'm trying to attack this guy.

2385
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
He was flexing hard there.

2386
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
The bolter is bouncing hard.

2387
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
It might be time to change games.

2388
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Games to the drawing game.

2389
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Did you just see what just happened?

2390
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Yeah, the medic took...it was a tank.

2391
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Something's fishy in here.

2392
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Stinks.

2393
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Something's stinky.

2394
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Something stinks in here.

2395
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
They're really stinky.

2396
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Look at my rocket jumping skills.

2397
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
They don't exist.

2398
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
There he is again.

2399
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
There's the robot tank.

2400
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Maybe he's the alien, Jerma.

2401
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Maybe he's the invader.

2402
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Did they get invaded by civilian medic robot tanks?

2403
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
2000 HP.

2404
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Yes.

2405
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:10,000
See?

2406
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:16,000
They put fun to this update after all.

2407
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2408
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
One more life.

2409
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:26,000
One more life and then I'm going to go play something else.

2410
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
There's going to be a pyro life.

2411
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,000
You know, we're going to end out the TF2 run with a flag pyro run.

2412
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
You're the bottom.

2413
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:39,000
It's time to get in that Sasquatch costume.

2414
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Yep.

2415
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
The medic comes back over here.

2416
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I'm just going to feed off him and then go crit people.

2417
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Feed her.

2418
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
He missed the robot medic.

2419
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:56,000
There he is.

2420
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Things do not add up.

2421
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I'm going to feed him.

2422
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,000
He's just trying to have no.

2423
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Oh, but.

2424
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,000
But he was right there.

2425
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,000
I'm going to play the dragon.

2426
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
There he is.

2427
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Now, I got to get one flock.

2428
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I got to get one turn the corner and flock.

2429
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Don't worry.

2430
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Everyone is stream sniping you.

2431
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
So they'll know to stay back.

2432
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Well,

2433
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
shit happens, right?

2434
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
No, it doesn't.

2435
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Not to me.

2436
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
And not to me either, dude.

2437
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Shit happens.

2438
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Ha ha.

2439
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:55,000
So after this, we're going to, well, you want, are you awake to play drawing game?

2440
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I am.

2441
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,000
I'm going to play with the monster.

2442
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Starry you.

2443
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Is that what you post pointing that for another day?

2444
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
What did they come on?

2445
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Come on.

2446
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,000
That was about to do it, too.

2447
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Would you actually draw a game?

2448
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Didn't we need more people?

2449
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
That was the issue.

2450
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I can't go all the way like that.

2451
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Okay, Jordan.

2452
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Okay, he's in the stream.

2453
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Do we need boo?

2454
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:21,000
We can boo.

2455
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Just want to play TF2.

2456
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Yeah, we can't do that.

2457
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
So we can't do that.

2458
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Yeah, we can't do that.

2459
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I can't do that.

2460
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
I can't do that.

2461
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I can't do that.

2462
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
No, you can't do that.

2463
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
I can't do that.

2464
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I can't do that.

2465
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
There's a couple of things you can actually do.

2466
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Well, I could.

2467
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Another all going actually.

2468
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,000
That medic.

2469
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Hypothomatic.

2470
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
No, this is not the rope.

2471
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
No, no.

2472
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
You do talking about robo medic.

2473
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Yeah.

2474
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,000
There are like five people chasing around trying to overstop.

2475
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Oh, fag-istinator.

2476
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Yeah, keep me over it.

2477
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Keep me over it so I can like actually get out of spawn and hurt someone.

2478
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Fuck horropo medic.

2479
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Everyone, why don't you have subs?

2480
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Oh, shit.

2481
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Dude, big Walees.

2482
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
I

2483
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,000
You see some of that the name of it. I think it is truffle

2484
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Stir

2485
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
We need another guy

2486
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:41,000
You know, not I am tired and we're gonna we need to get boys for it one day all right

2487
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,000
We'll get some boys look look look look. We'll get some some gentlemen look at some

2488
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
I don't lock gentlemen. I want boys

2489
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Suggestible boys

2490
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
So that was it what I'm gonna do

2491
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
See what am I gonna do right now

2492
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Banny

2493
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Banny you know banny someone said I think he was suggesting a boy

2494
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Sure, Banny would play it on blocks and invasion crate. I don't have an invasion crate. I

2495
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Probably would

2496
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Nothing dropped

2497
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:25,000
All right, I'm going to use the restroom I'm gonna rest a little bit in the restroom

2498
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:31,000
And then I'm gonna figure out I might stop streaming I might move to something else. Oh

2499
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
I'd recommend

2500
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I think I might go you're leaving

2501
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Possibly this dog is looking at speed. I think that means it's time for bed. Oh she's sleepy

2502
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
That's gonna be

2503
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Yeah, this is live streamer bathroom time

2504
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:55,000
You know how we need to have one of streamer's like cameras everywhere for any room you go

2505
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
And it has some all live at any time

2506
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:03,000
So I'm gonna have like a nine camera shoot inside my bathroom. Yeah, swing galaxy style

2507
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,000
There's just gonna be one in every corner on everywhere. Yeah

2508
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:12,000
That way you can you can cut it into a montage when you're done with multiple angles

2509
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Make a frag movie out of it

2510
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
That would be pretty

2511
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Pretty stupid

2512
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,000
All right guys, I'm back. You two are leaving. I'm assuming

2513
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
I guess all right, we're losing these two chumps

2514
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Good night everybody. Thanks. Thanks for hanging out in the stream guys. It was fun. Oh no problem. Be here Friday

2515
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,000
He's he just killed come on didn't you get to say a formal goodbye?

2516
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Unbelievable

2517
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
You

2518
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Tell her germa he needs to eat the cheese

2519
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
What cheese?

2520
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:58,000
I actually would play Mario maker right now if this room was set up to be able to play it

2521
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I don't have my Wii U in this room

2522
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:07,000
But hang tight. I will be back in a couple minutes. I'm gonna grab a drink. I'm gonna take the take the bathroom

2523
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,000
I'm gonna take the bathroom out of my bathroom and use it in my living room. Have you right back?

2524
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Hold on a second

2525
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,000
You

2526
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,000
You

2527
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,000
You

2528
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:15,000
You

2529
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
You

2530
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
You

2531
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Okay, I got some lemonade

2532
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I

2533
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,000
What can I do right now just to kind of chill for a little bit

2534
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,000
I don't know let's see what do I got what do I got on the steam library

2535
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Good play I

2536
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Can play more cryptarch but that requires a ton of my focus

2537
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:46,000
I'd rather just chill for the remaining like however long I'm gonna stream for

2538
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
So many games in liat nothing to play

2539
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
You

2540
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Mind sweeper

2541
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
I'll start actually went to bed. I think

2542
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
All right, maybe I'll do this

2543
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Give me a second I will load it up

2544
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Yeah, that's a game. That's really easy just to turn your brain off and I'll you know we'll do how about this

2545
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:53,000
For the last like I'm gonna be 30 minutes. I'm gonna play Diablo 3

2546
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Just kind of run around and swirl in people maybe

2547
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,000
And maybe I'll play like a hardstone and be terrible

2548
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,000
All right, hold on a second. I want to get this like to see

2549
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:09,000
What would you guys would rather see here?

2550
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Oh, whoops, there is no game

2551
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
I don't have a game to show you

2552
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:30,000
All right, gonna either play a hardstone and be terrible binding of Isaac or Diablo

2553
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Which one

2554
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,000
And I'm gonna warn you guys

2555
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Watching me play hardstone is going to drive a ton of you crazy

2556
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Let's do a let's do a poll

2557
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
I'm gonna do one of those fancy polls that you see from time to time

2558
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Hmm

2559
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Stop changing

2560
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Yeah, this is gonna be very simple straw poll

2561
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Okay, I'm gonna put it in the chat why not

2562
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:45,000
And we have you have 30 seconds to vote by the way

2563
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
You have 30 seconds to vote on this poll

2564
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Well, binding of Isaac seems to be destroying everything else right now

2565
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:11,000
All right, we're gonna we're closing this out in like less than 30 seconds

2566
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Play wonder book that is actually not a terrible idea

2567
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Not tonight. I definitely can't do it tonight

2568
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
But

2569
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Damn, that would be really cool

2570
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Because those games that are really funny and really crazy, but they're actually pretty interesting

2571
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:48,000
All right, it's very clear binding of Isaac is winning by way too much for anything else to win

2572
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:56,000
So yeah, where the poll is now closed. I'm gonna play binding of Isaac is he gonna be

2573
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:02,000
binding of Isaac and I'm just gonna answer questions. He may questions and answers binding of Isaac time

2574
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
So let's load that up

2575
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Oh

2576
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Go play a real game

2577
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Yeah, binding of Isaac won by like it like it was like 60 percent or something or 50 something percent

2578
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I

2579
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Need to change my stream title to make sense

2580
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
So I'm not playing to you anymore

2581
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:55,000
To make sense. Oh, no, I can hear my voice. She keeps you presents messin with Sasquatch

2582
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
No, there's like an ad playing now, too

2583
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Hey guys. Oh, thanks big and a sasquatch messin with Sasquatch

2584
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I'm getting a messing with Sasquatch ad

2585
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Here you go, fella. Try this one

2586
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Why

2587
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Why do I think that's so funny?

2588
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
We were talking about Sasquatch this whole time

2589
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I applied wish I please tell you guys heard that

2590
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
He's real Sasquatch is real

2591
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I'm at rock bottom. I hit it. I hit rock bottom

2592
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Perfect

2593
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Okay

2594
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Close that

2595
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
And I need to change this

2596
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
That's not right

2597
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
binding of Isaac rebirth

2598
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
There it is

2599
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:23,000
So for the remainder, this is I'm just gonna be chilling and I'm gonna answer questions

2600
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
How does that sound we're gonna do some questions and answers and answers

2601
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Currently on a minus two not doing hard. This is just hanging out

2602
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Take a sip of my lemonade. This is delicious

2603
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Are we gonna get a germa rumble this holiday? I really sincerely hope so

2604
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:54,000
But I can't guarantee it. I'm going to do everything in my power to do this particular video

2605
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Hopefully it happens. It's gonna be hard. I'm gonna do king

2606
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
I

2607
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Would have inspired me to create grandpa

2608
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Well grandpa I think I've actually answered this before

2609
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:21,000
It's based on my grandmother that voice and that like whole character is pretty much just my biological grandmother

2610
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
She used to talk just like that. I would imitate her

2611
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,000
She lived with us in the house when I was growing up

2612
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
And that's kind of how it worked

2613
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I'm ever gonna get real platinum god absolutely no

2614
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Well, it depends if the new

2615
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Isaac expansion is really really awesome and really fun

2616
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Maybe I'll play this shit out of that I don't know

2617
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
I can't guarantee anything

2618
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Dude, guys, here's another thing. I don't even know what I'm gonna have for breakfast tomorrow

2619
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,000
And like videos and and and all this stuff. I don't I have no idea

2620
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I'm gonna try to make whatever I can make and do whatever I can do

2621
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,000
But I seriously don't even know what I'm gonna do tomorrow. It's always a mystery

2622
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I'm using a controller right now. Yes

2623
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
I find it easier for me to use a controller

2624
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Oh shit, I'm stuck in here

2625
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Before I die from this guy

2626
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Did you go to college? Yes, I did I did go to college

2627
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I have I have a bachelor's degree

2628
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
And what do you know I'm also a young bachelor

2629
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Hey, buddy

2630
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
I

2631
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Tremble why are you bad at this game

2632
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Well, I

2633
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Have not particularly great at any particular game

2634
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Maybe maybe I was in my my wonder years kind of

2635
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:20,000
But was my reaction with star beat kryptalk in a few hours

2636
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
That's just what he does

2637
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
That's just what he does

2638
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Stodges beats every game and it plays it to its utmost like he plays the shit out of it and beats everything

2639
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Before I even like have a chance to even download the game

2640
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
That's just what he does

2641
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
I'm pretty good mobile game player

2642
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
I wait with the secret room B

2643
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:53,000
I'm gonna guess right here

2644
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
And please be right

2645
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Shit

2646
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Are you still doing volunteer work or did that magical idea for rarry? No, I actually actually oh

2647
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,000
I'll talk about that for a minute or two. I'm just gonna go. I'm not going in there

2648
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:16,000
I did that where I was at a volunteer at an animal shelter for eight months

2649
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,000
I stopped a while back before I moved

2650
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:25,000
It was really interesting experience. I will gotta say

2651
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
I walked to dogs

2652
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
That was a dog walker

2653
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Sometimes there were a lot of dogs in the kennels sometimes there were like none

2654
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:40,000
So some days you'd be kind of boring you'd go in and they'd be like really nothing to do

2655
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
They'd be like maybe one real dog there, but then

2656
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:47,000
There was a very large amount of dogs that came in

2657
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
And for a while

2658
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:53,000
They was a lot to do in fact after actually the last like

2659
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Let's say like a full like good seven months or something like when I first got there the it was

2660
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I don't know hard to explain

2661
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
But there was uh

2662
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
It was definitely cool experience if you like dogs I would do it

2663
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:11,000
If you like animals why not you don't have to do it forever

2664
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Let's do it for as long as you can

2665
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Or just you don't dump

2666
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Kittens are puppies. Well, I just said I was a dog walker so fucking dogs puppies

2667
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Oh dog walker would have lame dude

2668
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
It's volunteer work man

2669
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
It wasn't lame

2670
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:47,000
I was still doing YouTube and stuff at the time and I've been doing YouTube for like five years

2671
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I also did wedding videos and stuff like I've been doing things. I don't do that anymore, but I did

2672
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
No, I'm never gonna do that with a cigar

2673
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Will you get out of there?

2674
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Get out of there dude

2675
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Oh my goodness, please come out of there

2676
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
I want to explore

2677
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,000
I'm everyone you were making a game. I think you talked about it. No, I wanted to write a book

2678
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Then I did start it, but

2679
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Came to the extremely quick conclusion that writing books is extremely difficult

2680
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
So I wrote a bunch of stuff

2681
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
and then

2682
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Life got in the way and I became too busy to even have enough like free time to care about that

2683
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
unfortunately

2684
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,000
I can't ever keep talking about undertale. What is undertale?

2685
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
This is a new game again on

2686
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:06,000
How come you lagged on insane aquarium?

2687
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:11,000
You mean like the third video I ever uploaded to YouTube?

2688
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I don't know

2689
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Probably because I was on like a shitty like dog shit laptop that had like less than like two gigahertz of the CPU speed

2690
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Really it's not there

2691
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Did I just miss that or something?

2692
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Hmm, I don't have enough money

2693
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

2694
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
That's what I get for not paying attention

2695
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Too bad

2696
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Undertale's a game is that it's mixed reviews and it's one of those games that is good because people say so but I'm not saying it's bad

2697
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Well, every game is subjectively bad to air somebody, you know

2698
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
I don't want to go in there. Let's just get the boss

2699
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Do I watch anime? I used to not really anymore

2700
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Back when I was in college. I was really like into it. I thought it was really cool and I can't like what the fuck am I doing

2701
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:33,000
One coin

2702
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
I

2703
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Don't I'm confused of what actually just happened. I thought if that was a troll bomb and the troll bomb spawned after that

2704
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Apparently

2705
02:20:50,000 --> 02:21:02,000
No, I mean really I started to watch the anime back when I was in college because my TV was pretty much permanently on adult swim and

2706
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Saturdays I believe is when they did their like big anime block and about some of those shows are pretty good

2707
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Oh

2708
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
I want to read this one. Let's see if I can answer it

2709
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
After I've monstrosized

2710
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Over the years of YouTube and life and all that other shit in the mix was the biggest thing that's changed for you

2711
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Or just what have you noticed that changed you?

2712
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Um

2713
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:53,000
That's a that's a good question because I really feel like over the last at least a couple of years

2714
02:21:53,000 --> 02:22:00,000
I've started to grow up and started to see really see a lot. I've been asking myself the questions of fuck

2715
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:06,000
I'm being like the old person, you know, I'm like oh back then it wasn't like that. It was so much

2716
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:10,000
We back when we were kids. I've been doing that a lot lately

2717
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
And I'd never ever used to do that

2718
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:19,000
But like I am seeing things now like in video games or in TV and movies and I'm just like what fuck is this?

2719
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:23,000
You know, I was like 19 so much cooler

2720
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,000
but

2721
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
You come to realize

2722
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Literally that's every single person when they get older has that conversation with themselves

2723
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:36,000
And also getting older too like turning 30 was kind of

2724
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
It's got scary you know what I mean

2725
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Who's a scary thing when you get over that age you're just kind of like okay

2726
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,000
I am 30 years old what the fuck is going on in my life

2727
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:58,000
You start to reevaluate things that you're doing you start to re-evaluate like where you are and where you want to be

2728
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
I wouldn't say it's depressing. It's kind of like

2729
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Almost like eye opening that you see you you start to see things you like differently

2730
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:15,000
I have like a bunch of kids in my family now like my brother and sister both have kids

2731
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
And it's just really weird

2732
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,000
You start to see that your parents start to get way older and it's

2733
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Like wow life just kind of keeps going doesn't it

2734
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Let it go

2735
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Yeah, you when you turn 30 you have that kind of you have to let it go a conversation. I've let it go

2736
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
You

2737
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Turn but looks eight

2738
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
That is I guess one thing that I have gone for myself

2739
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:00,000
I don't I don't like look like I'm 30 plus

2740
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:10,000
When I look in the mirror I don't see like a 35 year old even I'm not 35 but you know you get the idea

2741
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
You

2742
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Technology oh no no no this is this thing shit. I didn't want this

2743
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I actually don't like this at all. I thought it was one of the technologies

2744
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Favorite band is a gorilla's for sure

2745
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Since doing this whole move and everything no I've not been working out at all

2746
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Even a little bit before I moved like the last like four months or five months. I probably haven't been to the gym

2747
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Which that's I can get back there I gotta do that again

2748
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Open your face

2749
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Open your face

2750
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:06,000
In my fat now I don't think so I just made a video where you can see my whole body

2751
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
I don't think I'm fat

2752
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
All right, where am I going here

2753
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Oh, and I'm Kane what

2754
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
What the fuck

2755
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Oh my goodness gracious

2756
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
None of those were any good

2757
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Okay

2758
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Alrighty

2759
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:59,000
But I want to join a racing league for Isaac. I don't think I'm good enough at the game to be frank

2760
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:03,000
I would lose every time you probably fun to do it

2761
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Yeah

2762
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:11,000
But now I'm not I love watching people speedrun and race

2763
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
It's actually one of my favorite things to watch on twitch

2764
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,000
A lot of the speedrunners that do their streams

2765
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:24,000
I've been really into Mario maker been really into watching Mario maker streams

2766
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Now people that are like go to the game and like know what they're doing

2767
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Really like that a lot

2768
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
You

2769
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Shit

2770
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Yeah

2771
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Almost my favorite noise or sound

2772
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Uh

2773
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Okay

2774
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
probably

2775
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Rain hitting a roof

2776
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:14,000
That extremely distinctive rain hitting your roof sound

2777
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Yeah, you know what I'm like that like

2778
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
That

2779
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:29,000
If I could make it rain like that just that gentle heavy kind of big water droplet rain every night

2780
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
I'd probably do it

2781
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Give my dog those superpowers

2782
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Shot speed up helps a little bit doesn't it

2783
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
The

2784
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:57,000
The brain hitting your roof people's brains smash into my roof

2785
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:05,000
If you could go back in time what point would you go to I wouldn't I

2786
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Would not I would not go back

2787
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
And I can explain why I wouldn't go back

2788
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Go look if you ask me if I'd rather go backwards in time or forwards in time

2789
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
I would probably say forwards in time

2790
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Like if you have it was like oh you could go forward 10 years or backwards 10 years

2791
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:33,000
I don't know man like when growing up you

2792
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Like all the things that you can't do when you're the younger like oh yeah

2793
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I go back to when you're like 15 again or like 12 again or something

2794
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
This so much shit you can't do

2795
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
That you have to like wait again to be able to do

2796
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Nobody trusts you with anything you're like younger, you know what I mean like it's it's hard

2797
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Like the teenage years can be I mean they're a great time

2798
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:03,000
I bet you a lot of you guys are probably like in your teens. I would assume probably half you guys are like in like that

2799
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:08,000
You know 15 16 plus maybe college days. I don't know how old all all you guys are

2800
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:12,000
But with special when you're I wouldn't want to go back and like do it all again

2801
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Oh, but you could go back and you could change everything and do it so differently

2802
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:22,000
But I've ended up where I am right now and I'm the person I am right now because of the way that I already did it

2803
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
You know what I mean

2804
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Like what if I went back and I like changed something would I have ever done half the stuff that I'm doing

2805
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
You know, no

2806
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
You

2807
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Teen 24 18 that's what I expected

2808
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Sound like the late high school early college

2809
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
20 like the median something like 20 I can see that yeah

2810
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:55,000
28 with a with a fail the phase palm dude don't I'm 30 man

2811
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:01,000
It's not it's not it's not it's not old the world has changed

2812
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:07,000
30 is the new 25 in my opinion

2813
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
This room sucks

2814
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Hurry up get over here get that bet

2815
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
How the fuck are you 30

2816
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Hey, I wake up and ask myself that question a lot it just happened

2817
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:39,000
I graduated college and then I turned 30

2818
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:44,000
What was that was a rock back here which room was the rocket

2819
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
There

2820
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Now I can't do it there wait hold on could it be right here

2821
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Nope

2822
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Time seriously flies don't play MMOs I played World of Warcraft for a long time that took a lot of my time

2823
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
I played that game for years

2824
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Yes, the more germ of wrestling the more wrestling's on the way

2825
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Don't worry

2826
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:42,000
I'm I'm trying as hard as I possibly can

2827
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
To be able to make this next one

2828
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
There it is being worked on

2829
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Fuck where's my tear it's like all in the corner

2830
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Oh

2831
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:06,000
For the love of all that is sacred

2832
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Oh about to just cramp as the son of a bitch here we go

2833
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Find a fancy 11

2834
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Well, you'll be opening up subs and donations soon. Oh no

2835
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
No

2836
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Subs

2837
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Yes, but donations now

2838
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Now go go down to eight

2839
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Damn it. Why have both of these have to have bombs like that?

2840
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I mean if at some point I decide to do donations

2841
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:07,000
I don't I don't know it's it's one of those things that I don't think I'm ever going to do it

2842
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
What do that just do to me?

2843
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Well not that

2844
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Will your TF2 server ever come back? No, I don't think so

2845
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
I don't think so

2846
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:34,000
To be completely and totally honest it was kind of just a money sink that I had I had to just sort of get rid of

2847
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:44,000
And I didn't have like very many good like I have one good admin and he was really reliable and he was always around

2848
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:48,000
But I I don't know I don't feel like I need to have one

2849
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:55,000
I had it for a while that was a great I made a ton of videos on that server

2850
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Some of you guys might have even been in those videos where I did like the weird like event type stuff

2851
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Did I forget to get that I did

2852
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Like two floors ago I didn't get that I need to remember that one

2853
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Let's go back this way

2854
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Do I still enjoy TF2 after all these years? I mean I was just playing it

2855
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:39,000
The core game of team fortress two is does that do anything to this?

2856
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
It does

2857
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:48,000
That makes this arguably worse because it stutters

2858
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:54,000
The core game of TF2 will always be like one of the best games I've ever played

2859
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
But but there's always a but

2860
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,000
You

2861
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Has only so much you can say or do about anything

2862
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:10,000
If you guys are wondering why I like haven't really been making TF2 videos

2863
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
So because I don't like the game

2864
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:18,000
It's because I want something to say I want to like do something in those videos

2865
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:25,000
And it's lately it's been like uh there's not really a whole lot I can say or do

2866
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
Oh

2867
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
I

2868
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Don't die here

2869
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Go over there you slow as ball

2870
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:42,000
That doesn't mean that doesn't mean I don't like the game

2871
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
Forget what the Joker does we're just gonna use it

2872
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Wonderful

2873
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
I don't even wanted to get the key I'd rather just go in

2874
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:59,000
You can't drop the trinket what is it but button is it

2875
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
It's not that

2876
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Hold control I don't know what is on gamepad

2877
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:26,000
I don't think I have it set up for this

2878
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Does anyone know what it is on a gamepad is it even bound anything on a game

2879
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Of course of course I hit the button that I'm going to need right now

2880
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,000
There it is

2881
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
It's right trigger

2882
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
The brain just leaked

2883
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Are you a fan of Bernie Sanders um I'm just gonna say it I

2884
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
I don't like talking politics

2885
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:15,000
I don't I don't know enough about politics to

2886
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Really want to get into like a discussion about it

2887
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:23,000
But if you want to know if you'd like to know if you if you need to know where I um

2888
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Where am I low you chaotic neutral are you neutral lawful are you lawful good?

2889
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
I am right in the middle

2890
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
There are I am as in the middle as you probably could be

2891
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
But let's go

2892
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Any more hearts. I yeah this one

2893
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:48,000
But I don't like talking to even with my friends

2894
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:55,000
It's just like everyone has their opinions on things and you just don't want to get into like fights and debates with people about it

2895
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Because that's how it always happens where am I going

2896
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:09,000
I don't know like like Benjamin Franklin once said the great Benjamin Franklin

2897
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Oh, it's in a secret room. That's why

2898
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
The great Benjamin Franklin what's what the f

2899
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Which I'm just gonna go

2900
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Well donate the rest the great Benjamin Franklin one said

2901
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Error all things in moderation

2902
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
If you're too extreme with anything

2903
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:46,000
You're not following Benjamin Franklin the greatest president of the United States

2904
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Even though he wasn't a president

2905
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,000
He still felt like one and he's on the hungry

2906
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Oh

2907
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Andrew Jackson's on on the 20 oh Abraham Lincoln's on the five but Benjamin Franklin is on 100

2908
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
He's on the hundred

2909
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Like did we really have to have this discussion

2910
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Is George Washington on the hundred? I

2911
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Rest my case

2912
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
It's probably things they can do but do I care

2913
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Give me that heart

2914
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Do I follow any sports?

2915
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Not really I used to follow the red socks religiously

2916
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
The red socks were

2917
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:51,000
Like my life especially but what it was so awesome

2918
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:57,000
That 2004 and 2007 World Series. I got to see both of them like they're not live but

2919
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Watching that team win the World Series in 2004

2920
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Was awesome

2921
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:09,000
They haven't won it in like 90 years or like 86 years or something crazy

2922
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
And I was in my dorm room

2923
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Oh, no wait, where was I when was that 2004?

2924
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:25,000
No, I was in my two was I in college in 2004? I was right no

2925
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:30,000
No, I think I just barely was like a freshman in college

2926
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Yeah, yeah, I definitely was in college for that

2927
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
I am 30 sometimes you forget things

2928
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Oh god, this is gonna be annoying

2929
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Get away from me

2930
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
You

2931
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:02,000
See do any role models or people you'll look up to

2932
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Well, I mean Benjamin Franklin has got to be like the but not uh-huh

2933
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Well when I was younger when I was like in my teens it was Jim Carrey

2934
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:18,000
I like loved everything about Jim Carrey. I thought he was like the funniest

2935
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Most awesome the amazing dude ever

2936
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
But as of right now, I mean I

2937
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:35,000
I don't know I don't really have like a role model anymore

2938
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Will you stream FTL and the follow-up question is who question

2939
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Will you stream FTL and get a girlfriend

2940
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Uh, no one the first one because I I'm not that great at that game

2941
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:11,000
And the second one I don't know I don't know. I don't know who knows

2942
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
I

2943
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:23,000
What do I want to be when I grow up? Well, I've already grown up

2944
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:29,000
I wanted to be a magic wand maker when I was in preschool. That's what I said. I wanted to be

2945
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
They asked all the kids what they wanted to be when they grew up

2946
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:36,000
And you had the typical fire fighter doctor

2947
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Magic wand maker

2948
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:44,000
I wanted to I didn't want to be a magician. I wanted to make the magic ones

2949
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
What the

2950
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Why

2951
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Who cares? I do nobody nobody cares about the magic wand maker

2952
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
People want to see the magician

2953
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Magic wand maker I bet to the audience probably all laughed

2954
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Oh my god this game is fucked

2955
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:27,000
My little teddy wants to be an astronaut my little Jacob want to be a policeman and you're telling me your little shit child

2956
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:30,000
What to be a magical wand maker. It's imagination. All right

2957
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Imagination is really important. Don't have a lose it

2958
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Doesn't matter how old you get

2959
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Don't have a loser imagination

2960
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
What do you see yourself on your 30?

2961
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Well

2962
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Sitting right here right now doing this because that's where I currently am at 30. What does this thing mean?

2963
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
I

2964
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Don't think I've ever seen that before

2965
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
What is this

2966
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Well, okay, was it wasted bomb

2967
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:30,000
No one cares about the guy that makes the plans stuff and lucky charms

2968
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
I

2969
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Fuck lucky charms lucky charms is only good to get to the end of the marshmallows and then you don't want to eat it anymore

2970
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
You just eat and soggy bread

2971
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
I

2972
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:03,000
That was the first grade I was asking my favorite book was and I said Harry Potter because it's real

2973
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
Hey, like that. That's

2974
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:13,000
That's awesome. I hope you ashamed of that

2975
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
I thought Santa Claus was real until 12 months ago

2976
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Santa Claus is real that's what you guys don't understand

2977
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Give me something good

2978
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
I don't want just a bomb give me something good

2979
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Dog food yes

2980

I'm sorry that's the answer

2989
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:36,000

02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Oh, it's fucking stupid

02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Home alone is also extremely good that's the one you can't forget

2994
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:00,000
Muppet Christmas Carol home alone or jingle all the way

2995
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:06,000
I don't I don't even like why did I say jingle all the way

2996
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
I don't like that movie

2997
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
There was no reason for me to say jingle all the way I just said it

2998
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:19,000
All right jingle all the way because I don't I can't think of my favorite movies

2999
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000

Well, I'm just here man. I'm just here chilling

3015
02:48:53,000 --> 02:49:03,000

Took me a whole week to listen to all the music on my computer

3022
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
I know like you know I kind of envy

3023

Hi Poe envy people like you I

3024
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Wish I cared a lot about music

3025
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Because it's so music is something you can just kind of turn on and like care about it and listen to it

3026
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:52,000
No, that was a great song that's a great song out of my

3027
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
5,000 song collection

3028
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
I don't have that

3029
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:04,000
I like put on plastic beach for 20 minutes and that's it and then I've gotten then I'm done

3030
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
But I wish I cared more about music

3031
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Oh hey

3032
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Hey

3033
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:34,000
If you were a giant sick how long would you be

3034
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
I'm assuming that you're trying to say stick

3035
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
I don't know it the yardstick

3036
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Yeah, I'd be like a yardstick. I don't know

3037
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
What I study in college communication

3038
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Film TV radio

3039
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
I don't know why I was walking towards that guy

3040
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Oh

3041
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
You learned how to talk in college

3042
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
No, I learned how to

3043
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Well, I'm not being learned is pretty subjective

3044
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:31,000
I was

3045
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:38,000
Shown how like radio life is and going to studios and working on demo reels and

3046
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:43,000
How to use editing programs and more like shops and stuff like that and

3047
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:51,000
Media marketing and relation public relations. I was it was was that stuff whole thing

3048
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:01,000
But the thing I when I was in college what I wanted to do oh fuck

3049
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Damn it

3050
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:13,000
I've wanted to do like voice work voice acting acting in general

3051
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:15,000
I

3052
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:20,000
After being a magic wand maker I wanted to uh not to be like an actor

3053
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:34,000
Where did I meet star shoot many a tournament

3054
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:39,000
That's like the first time we ever saw each other in real life

3055
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
I

3056
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:44,000
Think like we needed another person for the shoot mania team and

3057
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Him and I just barely kind of started talking like just barely and I was like oh

3058
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:55,000
I know the perfect guy for the shoot mania team. He's like we could go to like a quake style games and TF2 and

3059
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
Oh, his name is his name star

3060
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:02,000
I like it. Of course. Oh my god you fucker. Oh

3061
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
My goodness

3062
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
crap

3063
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
Yeah, and it was me orb

3064
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
mlc stealth

3065
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:19,000
And star and I think it was orb couldn't play

3066
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Because it was a us only tournament you couldn't be from anywhere else around the world or something

3067
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:30,000
So orb was like oh shit. I can't play in this tournament

3068
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:35,000
And originally I think we're gonna get shibi was gonna fill but then it was like star and I think shibi

3069
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
No, it was it could be either one of them was who was gonna be

3070
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:40,000
But started up

3071
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Filling that spot and him and mlc stealth well mlc stealth just carried that entire time we played

3072
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
That was so cool

3073
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:52,000
I will go down as one of my favorite things like in like my gaming quote how long have been playing games

3074
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:57,000
Was like winning that tournament like being on that team and like being able to go to e3

3075
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Was like I just I had to do that. I was gonna get hit thousand times

3076
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
You

3077
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:20,000
You realize you have a entire two-hour stream posted where you do will calm the star

3078
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Yeah, but I mean we weren't like we weren't like friends and we didn't really hang out

3079
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:31,000
I thought the question was like when did I like meet and like start hanging out with star like we talked

3080
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:40,000
Not a whole lot like it was sometimes we were talked but it was really that like shoot mania tournament is when we started to become like real friends

3081
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:48,000
Everything before that was kind of like I kind of know you a little bit. I don't really know yet all but you know hi

3082
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
That was when our friendship started

3083
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
He locked in

3084
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Any regrets

3085
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
Everybody has regrets

3086
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Not really but I mean like yeah, I like shouldn't have eaten that taco in college when I was like had like colitis

3087
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
Yeah, that's a pretty best of regret

3088
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
You

3089
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000

3090
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000

3091
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
You

3092
02:55:56,000 --> 02:56:01,000
How does it feel to be a washed up gamer? Hey, I didn't make the washed up gamer washed up youtuber video

3093
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000

Washed up I can't see my health

3095
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:18,000
I just I just got I'm just a look at I'm the washed up gamer. I just got hit like three times in this room. I accept that terminology now

3096
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:26,000

3097
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:36,000
You forced start to make that no, I didn't

3098
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
We had a conversation

3099
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:50,000
About how funny it would be if in two months his in like next video is like another mod video

3100
02:56:53,000 --> 02:57:00,000
And then the ideas spiraled out and he started talking about like oh yeah, what if I I do this and then we could do that well not we him

3101
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Now you know a lot of you hear something you guys need to realize right a lot of the videos that star or I make I

3102
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Would say like half the time

3103
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
So I gotta like focus here

3104
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
Okay

3105
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Okay, that sucked um a lot of our videos or stem from us talking in a call

3106
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
About just random dumb shit

3107
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:57,000
And sometimes it's like I like it'd be really funny if you did that

3108
02:57:57,000 --> 02:58:01,000
And then one of us does it and we go oh wow that's funny

3109
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:07,000
Let me think maybe some of you guys think it's funny too or maybe interesting or whatever

3110
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:14,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't want that

3112
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000

Really didn't want to do that, but I may not have been made into this room

3138
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000

That tip of the hat started and even like the morning of tip of the hats

3192
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:43,000

03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
And like I came and late

03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:11,000
But yeah, I definitely like wanted to go

3200
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:15,000
There's just a bad time personally to be able to go

3201
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
Well

3202
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:26,000

What

3204
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
What I

3205
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,000

03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
Oh, that was the

3207
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,000
The shuffle crap

3208
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
The name of the pizza it's doctor oat curse

03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:10,000

3214

3216
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:04,000
Favorite water bottle brand uh

3217
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:08,000
Whatever one is the cheapest at the supermarket

3218
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:12,000
Fuck

3219
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:16,000

3220
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:19,000
Just got got just clipped on that wall that shouldn't have happened

3221
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:23,000
I can't let this run go to shit. I have monstero

3222
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:26,000
I'll be ashamed if I let this go to shit

3223
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:30,000
Do not let this go to shit

3224
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:33,000
Do I like dr pepper yes

3225
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:36,000
Although I don't really drink it that often anymore

3226
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
I just got the shot away from uh

3227
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:42,000
From soda

3228
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:44,000
Recently last couple of years years so

3229
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:52,000
What does he do doesn't he do something specific if he gets hit or something

3230
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:54,000
I don't know

3231
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:56,000
I don't know

3232
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:58,000
I don't know

3233
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:00,000
Doesn't he do something specific if he gets hit or something

3234
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:18,000
Oh

3235
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:25,000
I mean soda can be good like I don't know I die

3236
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:30,000
I used to drink a lot of soda

3237
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:35,000
And I still do it occasionally I'm at like the restaurant or something I'll get like a coke

3238
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:40,000
Out of the glass, you know you drink it out of the glass. It's just oh I'm drinking a coke out of the glass

3239
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:45,000
Something about a coke out of the glass at a restaurant is just good

3240
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:55,000
Yay

3241
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:01,000
I

3242
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:04,000
Shoot two different tiers each time the same as two of you

3243
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
So if I have familiar as it'll do it

3244
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:15,000
Hmm okay I'm here about the secret road

3245
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:33,000
Hey, thank goodness and the devil room

3246
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:41,000
Huh

3247
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,000
Well, I could this could be real interesting

3248
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,000
If I get baby brimstone

3249
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:52,000
We could have a lot of uh

3250
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:56,000
A lot of fun, but I would also be down to one heart

3251
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:04,000
Is it worth is the words doing it

3252
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:14,000
Yeah, I know I got to get the eternal heart to

3253
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:23,000
Oh, I could I could do this, but I would have no heart

3254
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:31,000
Oh

3255
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:43,000
I'm gonna die

3256
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:51,000
Okay, let's go for it

3257
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:55,000
Let's do it

3258
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:05,000
And how can he didn't do it? Why is he not doing it?

3259
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:12,000
Did I just get fucking

3260
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:17,000
What he's not doing anything

3261
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:19,000
I

3262
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:27,000
Just I

3263
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:30,000
How come he's not shooting anything

3264
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:41,000
Always doing flies but that's not I didn't want I wanted them to shoot out the

3265
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:44,000
Second double brimstone

3266
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:54,000
Where is it? It's down here

3267
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:06,000
All right place your bets am I gonna get hit before I can uh use this in this room. I'm gonna hit five times

3268
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:08,000
Oh

3269
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
Oh he doesn't he doesn't copy brimstone

3270
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:22,000
Okay

3271
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:29,000
Well, you just instantly insta died

3272
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000
Figure what answers does

3273
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:35,000
I

3274
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:39,000
I feel like I shouldn't take that because doesn't that make everything a uh

3275
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:44,000
The bad bloody chest

3276
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:53,000
He's got to kind of get him in a way

3277
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:55,000
Oh

3278
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:01,000
He should tag of the flies

3279
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:14,000
That doesn't do anything does it

3280
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:17,000
Oh

3281
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:19,000
Look at how long that is now

3282
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:33,000
But does does that do me no does no synergy there I don't think

3283
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:40,000
Damn it I thought that was gonna be synergizing

3284
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:47,000
Is it more

3285
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:50,000
Maybe it is

3286
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:55,000
I

3287
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:58,000
Can do the pa again if I really wanted to

3288
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:04,000
How much of this game have I played like maybe 70 or 75 hours

3289
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:10,000
The problem with Isaac though is if you don't I I'd never played

3290
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:15,000
All my time in Isaac was when it first came out

3291
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:21,000
So it's bit literally up until like a couple weeks ago or so was it's been like probably like a year since I played it

3292
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:24,000
So I just forget everything that's in the game

3293
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:30,000
And even still I was one of those wiki people I needed to use the wiki because I just didn't know every that I always forgot what stuff did

3294
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:43,000
Come on that was blinking I did it

3295
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:54,000
Oh

3296
03:16:57,000 --> 03:16:59,000
Not 4.50

3297
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:04,000
Yeah, at least the flies will kill things while I'm charging that is correct

3298
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:18,000
Most flies really are doing work

3299
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,000
Oh

3300
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:28,000
Just go oh no no no no way way

3301
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:40,000
And shit to you

3302
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:54,000
Getting all my hearts back that's a good thing

3303
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:06,000
If I find the broken remote with the pa take it infinite teleports

3304
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:09,000
Could go down and explore but whatever

3305
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:31,000
Well you hit him oh my god thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you

3306
03:18:33,000 --> 03:18:35,000
Nothing in this room

3307
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:38,000
Oh

3308
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:49,000
How's auto doing fantastic he's right behind me

3309
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:55,000
Sleeping being a good boy if you heard me say his name so he looked up over here

3310
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:59,000
He's a good dog

3311
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:01,000
He's my little buddy

3312
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:15,000
This is really really good though

3313
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:23,000
The only bad part about this is besides the flies it takes me forever to I it takes me forever to do a ton of damage

3314
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:27,000
Gonna make sure I'm hitting things

3315
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:31,000
This is pretty sweet

3316
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:34,000
Oh

3317
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:37,000
Oh boy

3318
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:39,000
Oh boy

3319
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:43,000
Would you look at that now we're talking

3320
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:53,000
Shit's gonna uh

3321
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:58,000
Shit's gonna really start to uh hit the fan if I get the familiar upgrade

3322
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:03,000
I

3323
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:17,000
Yeah

3324
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:23,000
Oh

I did I really I just did that I actually just did that

3326
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:33,000
I waited so long and everything

3327
03:20:43,000 --> 03:20:45,000
Even more health

3328
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:48,000
But

3329
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:52,000
Hmm

3330
03:20:53,000 --> 03:20:58,000
I could do the pa again and then take the book

3331
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:03,000
I

3332
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:10,000

3333
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:13,000
What do you think

3334
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:24,000

Get the cat you have nothing to lose I don't know if I want to get the cat

3337
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:47,000
We're at least getting the book up a lot of

3338
03:21:48,000 --> 03:21:50,000
Because that's just it's just outrageous

3339
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:52,000

03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:58,000

3341
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:01,000
I really don't like the cat item

3342
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:04,000
I'm gonna go on our merry way I'll just take the book

3343
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:12,000
I still need to go into

3344
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:16,000
I didn't miss the item rum

3345
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:19,000
Yeah, I don't care we're just gonna go

3346
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:22,000

03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:45,000
Now I now I got nine lives and it's gonna I'm gonna get too confident

3351
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:48,000
And I'm gonna die nine times

3352
03:22:52,000 --> 03:22:54,000
Oh the cat gives you a heart

3353
03:22:57,000 --> 03:22:59,000
Whoops

3354
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:06,000
What a washed out what a what a washed up video game player

3355
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:14,000
I

3356
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:20,000
Everyone's saying to go back to the putt I want it. I want the book of I want the book

3357
03:23:21,000 --> 03:23:23,000
Do you know how much damage I want to be doing

3358
03:23:25,000 --> 03:23:27,000
I don't care about it. It's a guppy

3359
03:23:28,000 --> 03:23:30,000
Say I want to be able to go like this

3360
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:33,000
See now I go

3361
03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:44,000
I want a shit room

3362
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:51,000
I want the shit room that was

3363
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:10,000
If this was original Isaac yeah, I maybe I'm putting two together

3364
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:13,000
You

3365
03:24:18,000 --> 03:24:20,000
Watch out everybody don't get blown up

3366
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:33,000
Fill up your mouth let's go

3367
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:36,000
Hmm

3368
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:46,000
Rang up I'll take it

3369
03:24:49,000 --> 03:24:51,000
It's definitely to find some stuff

3370
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:59,000
I don't know the chant like the chances of me getting more guppy. I mean what is the actual chances here

3371
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:09,000
If it happens it happens, you know, but I don't know I never want to rely you can never read the lie on something dropping in this game

3372
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:12,000
Because it's everything is just random

3373
03:25:15,000 --> 03:25:17,000
If I think just randomized it's a randomized dungeon

3374
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:32,000
Oh god. Oh god damn it

3375
03:25:34,000 --> 03:25:36,000
Come on

3376
03:25:36,000 --> 03:25:38,000
I fucking hate these things

3377
03:25:40,000 --> 03:25:42,000
Especially when they're this close

3378
03:25:50,000 --> 03:25:52,000
spiderbox

3379
03:25:55,000 --> 03:25:57,000
Not that not as good as book of the lie

3380
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:03,000
I could go in the coin shop today

3381
03:26:10,000 --> 03:26:14,000
I'm gonna scream I'm gonna just scream at the top of my lungs

3382
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:26,000
Gonna fucking start screaming

3383
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:31,000
You

3384
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:46,000
Okay, so I have one heart right for two hearts

3385
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:51,000
Shit

3386
03:27:00,000 --> 03:27:02,000
It's pretty handy

3387
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:10,000
Now I get two hearts

3388
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:15,000
I really have just been kind of skipping the secret rooms unfortunately

3389
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:20,000
But we're just trying to go

3390
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:25,000
You know we're just going

3391
03:27:30,000 --> 03:27:36,000
You're gonna give me another one of these you're gonna give me another one of these with an obstacle in the way I

3392
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:39,000
Have to go around that

3393
03:27:40,000 --> 03:27:43,000
You know I have to I have to go around that how annoying

3394
03:27:49,000 --> 03:27:51,000
Well

3395
03:27:52,000 --> 03:27:55,000
Come on I might go it's good

3396
03:27:55,000 --> 03:27:57,000
I

3397
03:27:58,000 --> 03:28:03,000
Have to go back. Oh, I hate those rooms with a passion

3398
03:28:07,000 --> 03:28:09,000
Here we go, let's go again

3399
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:27,000
Oh

3400
03:28:29,000 --> 03:28:31,000
Let's jump in all over the place if you stop moving do

3401
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:36,000
Just have some hearts okay

3402
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:46,000
Okay

3403
03:28:49,000 --> 03:28:53,000
What's your favorite flavor of ice cream pretty much just standard chocolate

3404
03:28:54,000 --> 03:28:59,000
If it's not standard chocolate then it's what I said earlier like the fudge brownie ice cream from Ben and Jerry's

3405
03:29:00,000 --> 03:29:02,000
This is crazy

3406
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:08,000
Actually, I don't remember the name of it. It's like double fudge ultra fudge brownie guy mode. I don't know something

3407
03:29:08,000 --> 03:29:12,000
It's got a weird name all Ben and Jerry's ice cream has weird screwy Louis names

3408
03:29:15,000 --> 03:29:18,000
Like chip and Dale's rescue Ranger raspberry lime Ricky

3409
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:24,000
Okay, could just call it raspberry ice cream

3410
03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:40,000
Where's the last one there you are

3411
03:29:42,000 --> 03:29:45,000
Fish food your fish food's good that's more than marshmallow, right?

3412
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:47,000
The

3413
03:29:47,000 --> 03:29:49,000
Chocolate pieces

3414
03:29:50,000 --> 03:29:54,000
Half baked is good almost all of the Ben and Jerry's ice cream is good

3415
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:06,000
All right

3416
03:30:12,000 --> 03:30:14,000
Is that do anything

3417
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:22,000
How does that pulses it does it does that's neat

3418
03:30:29,000 --> 03:30:31,000
That's a real neat

3419
03:30:31,000 --> 03:30:33,000
Oh

3420
03:30:42,000 --> 03:30:44,000
Just hit that kind of thing

3421
03:30:52,000 --> 03:30:54,000
Trying just to make one of them hit them

3422
03:31:01,000 --> 03:31:03,000
you

3423
03:31:15,000 --> 03:31:17,000
no

3424
03:31:28,000 --> 03:31:30,000
oh

3425
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:45,000
I got money to spend we're going in here. Can I see the chat? Of course I can. Of course I can see the chat.

3426
03:32:01,000 --> 03:32:03,000
Blackheart.

3427
03:32:07,000 --> 03:32:13,000
I'm getting so many HP ops. This game really wants me to stay alive with the current build that I have.

3428
03:32:17,000 --> 03:32:21,000
I'll just take that for this room and then I'm going to throw it away.

3429
03:32:21,000 --> 03:32:23,000
I'm going to throw it away.

3430
03:32:29,000 --> 03:32:33,000
Thank you for the numerous hilarious videos of Brighton in my life.

3431
03:32:33,000 --> 03:32:39,000
You're welcome, dude. Thanks for even carrying about them in the first place.

3432
03:32:39,000 --> 03:32:43,000
I should be thanking you.

3433
03:32:43,000 --> 03:32:45,000
Oh!

3434
03:32:45,000 --> 03:32:47,000
Oh!

3435
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:51,000
There it is. There's the item.

3436
03:32:53,000 --> 03:32:55,000
There it is.

3437
03:32:57,000 --> 03:32:59,000
That's what we like to call a good game.

3438
03:33:03,000 --> 03:33:05,000
Look at this troop I got now.

3439
03:33:09,000 --> 03:33:13,000
Nice. Oh wow, that's amazing.

3440
03:33:15,000 --> 03:33:17,000
Well, I'm going to just take this for fun.

3441
03:33:21,000 --> 03:33:23,000
Whatever.

3442
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:25,000
Whatever.

3443
03:33:27,000 --> 03:33:29,000
All right, let's go ahead and win this one.

3444
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:35,000
If you don't know what that does, that makes all of my familiars do more damage. They're just even better.

3445
03:33:35,000 --> 03:33:41,000
They grow stronger and they get probably more powerful. It's just, it's for what I'm doing right now, this is unbelievable.

3446
03:33:45,000 --> 03:33:51,000
I guess I could start hurting. No, I don't even.

3447
03:33:51,000 --> 03:33:57,000
Luck up. All right. Just I don't even care.

3448
03:33:57,000 --> 03:34:01,000
I could just like farm all this, but I have plenty of items.

3449
03:34:01,000 --> 03:34:05,000
I have plenty of bombs, plenty of keys.

3450
03:34:05,000 --> 03:34:09,000
I could get the blood bag or something, but you know, who really cares?

3451
03:34:09,000 --> 03:34:17,000
Do I have donations set up? No, I answered this before. I'll answer it again.

3452
03:34:17,000 --> 03:34:21,000
I'm not doing donations.

3453
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:27,000
At least at least for the foreseeable future.

3454
03:34:31,000 --> 03:34:35,000
And that did a lot.

3455
03:34:39,000 --> 03:34:47,000
See you later, Mom.

3456
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:57,000
Okay, did I win? I think I won.

3457
03:34:57,000 --> 03:34:59,000
Did I win?

3458
03:34:59,000 --> 03:35:01,000
Does I won? I did it.

3459
03:35:01,000 --> 03:35:03,000
I did it, guys.

3460
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:05,000
I did it.

3461
03:35:05,000 --> 03:35:07,000
Yeah.

3462
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:11,000
What the fuck?

3463
03:35:17,000 --> 03:35:19,000
I won the video game.

3464
03:35:19,000 --> 03:35:23,000
I won the video game.

3465
03:35:29,000 --> 03:35:31,000
Look at me.

3466
03:35:31,000 --> 03:35:39,000
If I lose this game, I'm going to uninstall Isaac.

3467
03:35:45,000 --> 03:35:55,000
If I don't at least beat like mom's heart, something's wrong.

3468
03:35:55,000 --> 03:35:57,000
Now let's take the book.

3469
03:36:05,000 --> 03:36:09,000
Okay, I'm not going to take that. That's too much.

3470
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:13,000
Look at a little cat.

3471
03:36:15,000 --> 03:36:19,000
All right. Oh, that was the end.

3472
03:36:19,000 --> 03:36:23,000
It's almost physically impossible for me not to at least get to Isaac.

3473
03:36:23,000 --> 03:36:25,000
Right?

3474
03:36:25,000 --> 03:36:31,000
If you don't understand what happened, if you pick up, it's three items in the guppy,

3475
03:36:31,000 --> 03:36:39,000
quote, guppy line, if you will, you turn into a guppy of the cat and you just

3476
03:36:39,000 --> 03:36:41,000
steamroll every single room.

3477
03:36:41,000 --> 03:36:45,000
Pretty much.

3478
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:51,000
All right, let's go.

3479
03:36:53,000 --> 03:36:59,000
Let's see. Let's see what a guppy can do.

3480
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:01,000
Let's move.

3481
03:37:01,000 --> 03:37:05,000
Whoops. Uninstall hype.

3482
03:37:05,000 --> 03:37:09,000
Uninstall hype, guys.

3483
03:37:09,000 --> 03:37:13,000
I just took that damage I should not have taken.

3484
03:37:13,000 --> 03:37:15,000
Uninstall hype.

3485
03:37:15,000 --> 03:37:17,000
Got these flies.

3486
03:37:17,000 --> 03:37:21,000
Oh, there's so many of them.

3487
03:37:21,000 --> 03:37:27,000
I think this is actually only the second time I've ever had guppy.

3488
03:37:27,000 --> 03:37:33,000
Come and get me.

3489
03:37:33,000 --> 03:37:37,000
Now we just pull out through the whole game.

3490
03:37:37,000 --> 03:37:39,000
I'm just going through every room out of the care.

3491
03:37:39,000 --> 03:37:43,000
We're not even like stopping. I'm only going to stop to charge before I go in a room.

3492
03:37:43,000 --> 03:37:47,000
Okay, no, hold on. We're going to stop here.

3493
03:37:47,000 --> 03:37:51,000
I'm just going to just range up.

3494
03:37:51,000 --> 03:37:55,000
Okay, the rest of those are paralysis.

3495
03:37:55,000 --> 03:37:57,000
You can fly over objects too.

3496
03:37:57,000 --> 03:38:01,000
What an unbeatable item.

3497
03:38:01,000 --> 03:38:05,000
I'll just take the case I need it for some reason.

3498
03:38:05,000 --> 03:38:07,000
Oh, thanks. Thanks for the heart.

3499
03:38:07,000 --> 03:38:11,000
Thanks for more free stuff.

3500
03:38:11,000 --> 03:38:15,000
Ha.

3501
03:38:15,000 --> 03:38:23,000
Turn on what is your real name?

3502
03:38:23,000 --> 03:38:27,000
It's uh, Arnold, Ellbertson.

3503
03:38:27,000 --> 03:38:31,000
Uninstall. Uninstall in the game.

3504
03:38:31,000 --> 03:38:33,000
Took another hit.

3505
03:38:33,000 --> 03:38:35,000
I should be taking zero hits.

3506
03:38:35,000 --> 03:38:39,000
I think I'm just getting overconfident.

3507
03:38:39,000 --> 03:38:45,000
Oh, overconfidence, man.

3508
03:38:45,000 --> 03:38:53,000
It's going to be the death of me.

3509
03:38:53,000 --> 03:38:55,000
At least I know those things will never touch me.

3510
03:38:55,000 --> 03:39:03,000
What boss isn't here that's going to insta die?

3511
03:39:03,000 --> 03:39:05,000
See you.

3512
03:39:05,000 --> 03:39:09,000
Another another devorow.

3513
03:39:09,000 --> 03:39:11,000
Oh my god.

3514
03:39:11,000 --> 03:39:15,000
Another one. Another one.

3515
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:19,000
I'm not even going to be able to see.

3516
03:39:19,000 --> 03:39:21,000
There's so many people.

3517
03:39:21,000 --> 03:39:29,000
There's too many people on the screen.

3518
03:39:29,000 --> 03:39:35,000
My friends.

3519
03:39:35,000 --> 03:39:39,000
I mean, I didn't have to do that, but you kind of have to.

3520
03:39:39,000 --> 03:39:41,000
If you have this setup, don't you?

3521
03:39:41,000 --> 03:39:45,000
Why not? Take another one.

3522
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:47,000
I'm not doing brimstone.

3523
03:39:47,000 --> 03:39:49,000
I already have this.

3524
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:51,000
And I already have guppy.

3525
03:39:51,000 --> 03:39:55,000
So I'm not taking two full hearts for no reason.

3526
03:39:55,000 --> 03:39:57,000
I like the super spit.

3527
03:39:57,000 --> 03:39:59,000
I'm not taking this.

3528
03:39:59,000 --> 03:40:01,000
I can go like this and fly.

3529
03:40:01,000 --> 03:40:03,000
But there's no reason to have that.

3530
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:07,000
I'm going to keep the book.

3531
03:40:07,000 --> 03:40:09,000
I'm not getting brimstone.

3532
03:40:09,000 --> 03:40:13,000
We want to have like a party.

3533
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:17,000
Oh, the book of a lot of the book of bliles doing that.

3534
03:40:17,000 --> 03:40:19,000
Okay, let's go.

3535
03:40:19,000 --> 03:40:21,000
Oh, that's not brimstone.

3536
03:40:21,000 --> 03:40:25,000
Now, brimstone has the two lines in it, right?

3537
03:40:25,000 --> 03:40:27,000
Curse of darkness.

3538
03:40:27,000 --> 03:40:29,000
Oh, no.

3539
03:40:29,000 --> 03:40:31,000
Whatever will I do.

3540
03:40:31,000 --> 03:40:33,000
Whatever will I do.

3541
03:40:33,000 --> 03:40:37,000
I can't see, but it doesn't matter.

3542
03:40:37,000 --> 03:40:41,000
It just doesn't matter.

3543
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:47,000
I have a machine gun of flies.

3544
03:40:47,000 --> 03:40:51,000
Nothing can stop me.

3545
03:40:51,000 --> 03:40:57,000
Just going, y'all, give me that key.

3546
03:40:57,000 --> 03:41:07,000
The flies.

3547
03:41:07,000 --> 03:41:09,000
This is so awesome.

3548
03:41:09,000 --> 03:41:13,000
Remember I said what was the percentage of me actually getting guppy?

3549
03:41:13,000 --> 03:41:17,000
And I got it.

3550
03:41:17,000 --> 03:41:21,000
Is it the getter you don't, right?

3551
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:25,000
It was hide over here too.

3552
03:41:25,000 --> 03:41:29,000
Is this such a joke?

3553
03:41:39,000 --> 03:41:41,000
Have I played the eternal mode?

3554
03:41:41,000 --> 03:41:43,000
Then Binding Visek 1?

3555
03:41:43,000 --> 03:41:45,000
No.

3556
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:47,000
Did they, the original?

3557
03:41:47,000 --> 03:41:49,000
Didn't they add stuff to it or something?

3558
03:41:49,000 --> 03:41:53,000
Is that what they added?

3559
03:42:03,000 --> 03:42:05,000
And here we go.

3560
03:42:05,000 --> 03:42:09,000
Well, let's do it.

3561
03:42:15,000 --> 03:42:23,000
Hmm.

3562
03:42:23,000 --> 03:42:27,000
Melting.

3563
03:42:27,000 --> 03:42:29,000
Melded.

3564
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:31,000
Jeez.

3565
03:42:31,000 --> 03:42:33,000
That is so awesome.

3566
03:42:33,000 --> 03:42:35,000
Although, hold on a second.

3567
03:42:35,000 --> 03:42:39,000
Did I not, I don't think I got the Polaroid.

3568
03:42:39,000 --> 03:42:43,000
Did I get the Polaroid in mom?

3569
03:42:43,000 --> 03:42:45,000
Did I just go try to be taken?

3570
03:42:45,000 --> 03:42:47,000
Or just be Isaac?

3571
03:42:47,000 --> 03:42:49,000
The Polaroid is for...

3572
03:42:49,000 --> 03:42:53,000
I don't even remember.

3573
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:57,000
The eternal mode really isn't that fun, just some new boss effects that happen sometimes.

3574
03:42:57,000 --> 03:42:59,000
I did get it, yeah, I got it.

3575
03:42:59,000 --> 03:43:01,000
Let's go.

3576
03:43:01,000 --> 03:43:07,000
Let's go to the cathedral.

3577
03:43:07,000 --> 03:43:09,000
Okay.

3578
03:43:09,000 --> 03:43:11,000
Are we uninstalling the game?

3579
03:43:11,000 --> 03:43:13,000
I don't know, very soon.

3580
03:43:31,000 --> 03:43:35,000
You got it, Jeremy, where me?

3581
03:43:35,000 --> 03:43:37,000
Jeremy, where me?

3582
03:43:41,000 --> 03:43:45,000
Oh, it's that guy.

3583
03:43:45,000 --> 03:43:49,000
The reason why I got hit is I didn't realize it was one of those green guys.

3584
03:43:49,000 --> 03:43:53,000
I wouldn't have gotten hit if I didn't though.

3585
03:44:03,000 --> 03:44:07,000
It's weird to see the Polaroid unlock before the negative.

3586
03:44:07,000 --> 03:44:11,000
What is the criteria for unlocking the negative?

3587
03:44:11,000 --> 03:44:15,000
I don't think I have it.

3588
03:44:15,000 --> 03:44:17,000
Can you spend your 50 gerbobox on that question?

3589
03:44:17,000 --> 03:44:19,000
You sure can?

3590
03:44:19,000 --> 03:44:21,000
But that was your question.

3591
03:44:21,000 --> 03:44:23,000
So, there it is.

3592
03:44:23,000 --> 03:44:25,000
Tented rock.

3593
03:44:25,000 --> 03:44:27,000
I missed it, but I'll get it.

3594
03:44:27,000 --> 03:44:29,000
I'll go get it.

3595
03:44:29,000 --> 03:44:31,000
Can't give up a tinted rocket.

3596
03:44:31,000 --> 03:44:33,000
This is a good one.

3597
03:44:33,000 --> 03:44:37,000
Can't give up a tinted rocket.

3598
03:44:37,000 --> 03:44:41,000
This point in the game.

3599
03:44:41,000 --> 03:44:43,000
Satan five times.

3600
03:44:43,000 --> 03:44:45,000
I've beaten megastatin, I think two or three times.

3601
03:44:45,000 --> 03:44:47,000
Have I just not even...

3602
03:44:47,000 --> 03:44:51,000
You know what? I might have just kept going to the cathedral.

3603
03:44:51,000 --> 03:44:53,000
I'm pretty sure that's what's going on.

3604
03:44:53,000 --> 03:44:55,000
I don't like go fight Satan ever.

3605
03:44:55,000 --> 03:44:57,000
I always go to fight Isaac.

3606
03:44:57,000 --> 03:45:01,000
Whenever I get there, I don't know how many times it's been.

3607
03:45:03,000 --> 03:45:13,000
I hate these chump characters.

3608
03:45:13,000 --> 03:45:23,000
Okay.

3609
03:45:23,000 --> 03:45:31,000
Let's do it.

3610
03:45:31,000 --> 03:45:55,000
I'm gonna stall the game.

3611
03:45:55,000 --> 03:45:57,000
There are a good idea.

3612
03:45:57,000 --> 03:46:03,000
I don't have to uninstall the game.

3613
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:13,000
I do not have to uninstall the biting of Isaac.

3614
03:46:13,000 --> 03:46:17,000
Oh my god.

3615
03:46:17,000 --> 03:46:19,000
Toad.

3616
03:46:19,000 --> 03:46:23,000
There's too many people.

3617
03:46:23,000 --> 03:46:25,000
This is...

3618
03:46:25,000 --> 03:46:33,000
I've never seen this many familiar.

3619
03:46:33,000 --> 03:46:35,000
I'm...

3620
03:46:35,000 --> 03:46:37,000
This is gonna confuse me now.

3621
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:39,000
Try to just get the orbit thing too.

3622
03:46:39,000 --> 03:46:45,000
Try to just get orbit.

3623
03:46:45,000 --> 03:46:49,000
Do cares, right?

3624
03:46:49,000 --> 03:46:51,000
Don't pick up that.

3625
03:46:51,000 --> 03:46:53,000
Do not pick up that.

3626
03:46:53,000 --> 03:46:55,000
Okay, fine.

3627
03:46:55,000 --> 03:46:57,000
We'll just...

3628
03:46:57,000 --> 03:47:03,000
We'll just lose here.

3629
03:47:03,000 --> 03:47:05,000
I honestly might lose to...

3630
03:47:05,000 --> 03:47:07,000
Is it Blue Baby?

3631
03:47:07,000 --> 03:47:17,000
I don't... I don't like him remember what he does.

3632
03:47:17,000 --> 03:47:29,000
I might just lose here.

3633
03:47:29,000 --> 03:47:31,000
I'm not gonna lie.

3634
03:47:31,000 --> 03:47:33,000
That technology baby is kind of freaking me out.

3635
03:47:33,000 --> 03:47:43,000
Like I keep seeing it and I keep thinking it's an enemy of some sort.

3636
03:47:43,000 --> 03:47:47,000
Can I hurt this fucking dude?

3637
03:47:47,000 --> 03:47:51,000
What the fuck?

3638
03:47:51,000 --> 03:47:59,000
Get the contact.

3639
03:47:59,000 --> 03:48:05,000
Oh, you asshole.

3640
03:48:05,000 --> 03:48:15,000
Even more flies.

3641
03:48:15,000 --> 03:48:25,000
Get in my fly, brethren.

3642
03:48:25,000 --> 03:48:45,000
I hope this is the right way.

3643
03:48:45,000 --> 03:48:47,000
What the fuck?

3644
03:48:47,000 --> 03:48:49,000
Oh, come on.

3645
03:48:49,000 --> 03:48:51,000
You didn't just really do that to me, baby.

3646
03:48:51,000 --> 03:48:53,000
Oh fuck.

3647
03:48:53,000 --> 03:48:57,000
What the hell?

3648
03:48:57,000 --> 03:49:01,000
Uh-oh.

3649
03:49:01,000 --> 03:49:07,000
Uh-oh.

3650
03:49:07,000 --> 03:49:13,000
The baby is ended up screwing me over there, guys.

3651
03:49:13,000 --> 03:49:17,000
Don't, don't, don't, don't do that.

3652
03:49:17,000 --> 03:49:19,000
Oh my fucking god.

3653
03:49:19,000 --> 03:49:21,000
Come on.

3654
03:49:21,000 --> 03:49:25,000
Slow down.

3655
03:49:25,000 --> 03:49:29,000
Slow the fuck down.

3656
03:49:29,000 --> 03:49:33,000
Why am I getting hit by these?

3657
03:49:33,000 --> 03:49:37,000
Why am I getting hit by these?

3658
03:49:37,000 --> 03:49:39,000
Holy shit.

3659
03:49:39,000 --> 03:49:41,000
Slow down.

3660
03:49:41,000 --> 03:49:47,000
I was moving too fast.

3661
03:49:47,000 --> 03:49:55,000
I was just going too fast and I forgot that I had to slow down right there.

3662
03:49:55,000 --> 03:50:03,000
No, I think that's probably the right way.

3663
03:50:03,000 --> 03:50:05,000
Not like this.

3664
03:50:05,000 --> 03:50:07,000
Not like this.

3665
03:50:07,000 --> 03:50:09,000
I've been on that room.

3666
03:50:09,000 --> 03:50:13,000
Hey, by the way, what the fuck dude?

3667
03:50:13,000 --> 03:50:15,000
Why? What the fuck?

3668
03:50:15,000 --> 03:50:17,000
I went in the room.

3669
03:50:17,000 --> 03:50:19,000
I opened the door and died.

3670
03:50:19,000 --> 03:50:21,000
It was like, legit.

3671
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:23,000
I, you guys saw, I didn't even move.

3672
03:50:23,000 --> 03:50:27,000
I didn't go anywhere.

3673
03:50:27,000 --> 03:50:29,000
Come here, break.

3674
03:50:29,000 --> 03:50:33,000
Am I just like getting blocked out from all my dudes?

3675
03:50:33,000 --> 03:50:37,000
I'm fucking terrified to walk right here.

3676
03:50:45,000 --> 03:50:47,000
It wasn't this way.

3677
03:50:47,000 --> 03:50:49,000
Shit.

3678
03:50:49,000 --> 03:50:57,000
I gotta go back through that stupid ass rum.

3679
03:50:57,000 --> 03:51:05,000
Oh my god.

3680
03:51:05,000 --> 03:51:09,000
I keep god of kidding me.

3681
03:51:09,000 --> 03:51:13,000
This is the rum that's going to end this whole thing.

3682
03:51:13,000 --> 03:51:23,000
This dumbass fucking room that I'm hitting the hitboxes on these things.

3683
03:51:23,000 --> 03:51:29,000
Go in, please.

3684
03:51:29,000 --> 03:51:33,000
Probably down on it soon.

3685
03:51:43,000 --> 03:51:53,000
Okay, then.

3686
03:51:53,000 --> 03:51:57,000
I don't know.

3687
03:51:57,000 --> 03:52:09,000
I really use the spirit heart right now.

3688
03:52:09,000 --> 03:52:11,000
Shit.

3689
03:52:11,000 --> 03:52:19,000
I forgot what these guys do.

3690
03:52:19,000 --> 03:52:21,000
Oh, damn it.

3691
03:52:21,000 --> 03:52:25,000
They spawn those things.

3692
03:52:25,000 --> 03:52:27,000
Oh, hey, by the way, uninstall hype was for Isaac.

3693
03:52:27,000 --> 03:52:29,000
Was for killing Isaac.

3694
03:52:29,000 --> 03:52:31,000
Not this.

3695
03:52:31,000 --> 03:52:35,000
This is nothing to do with uninstall hype.

3696
03:52:35,000 --> 03:52:37,000
Fuck.

3697
03:52:37,000 --> 03:52:43,000
This is why we game over.

3698
03:52:43,000 --> 03:52:57,000
This room is so hard with one heart.

3699
03:52:57,000 --> 03:53:13,000
No, time to uninstall the game.

3700
03:53:13,000 --> 03:53:15,000
No.

3701
03:53:15,000 --> 03:53:21,000
Ugh.

3702
03:53:21,000 --> 03:53:23,000
There's so many directions where you could die.

3703
03:53:23,000 --> 03:53:25,000
One heart.

3704
03:53:25,000 --> 03:53:29,000
I could have just bombed the door.

3705
03:53:29,000 --> 03:53:31,000
Hey, well, it was beating the...

3706
03:53:31,000 --> 03:53:33,000
It was getting to Isaac.

3707
03:53:33,000 --> 03:53:35,000
It beating Isaac.

3708
03:53:35,000 --> 03:53:39,000
I even said I don't think I was going to be able to beat this with like two hearts.

3709
03:53:39,000 --> 03:53:49,000
All I needed to prove was beating Isaac.

3710
03:53:49,000 --> 03:53:55,000
I should have used the fucking orb, but that was the problem.

3711
03:53:55,000 --> 03:54:01,000
Oh, you can't even bomb through rooms in the chest.

3712
03:54:01,000 --> 03:54:03,000
Honestly, let's be like real here.

3713
03:54:03,000 --> 03:54:11,000
Trying to beat the chest with one or two hearts is pretty much impossible as it is.

3714
03:54:11,000 --> 03:54:17,000
What really screwed me was the fucking stupid ass hitboxes on the red poo.

3715
03:54:17,000 --> 03:54:21,000
Like, what the fuck was that?

3716
03:54:21,000 --> 03:54:27,000
Like, I would walk in the door like this and die without even touching my controller.

3717
03:54:27,000 --> 03:54:29,000
I would just walk in and insta-die.

3718
03:54:29,000 --> 03:54:37,000
It happened like three times, at least.

3719
03:54:37,000 --> 03:54:45,000
That was really, really, really annoying.

3720
03:54:45,000 --> 03:54:53,000
Red poo pit boxes are extremely lame, especially when there's three of them in the only area you can move as your character.

3721
03:54:53,000 --> 03:54:57,000
I lost like three hearts there.

3722
03:54:57,000 --> 03:55:01,000
Like, it's legit. Let's be totally real here.

3723
03:55:01,000 --> 03:55:03,000
I went like this and died.

3724
03:55:03,000 --> 03:55:05,000
I didn't even move in.

3725
03:55:05,000 --> 03:55:07,000
I don't touch in anything.

3726
03:55:07,000 --> 03:55:09,000
Just, ugh!

3727
03:55:09,000 --> 03:55:13,000
That was what happened.

3728
03:55:13,000 --> 03:55:21,000
And that brought me down to one, which if I even had more than one hit I could take, that would be great.

3729
03:55:21,000 --> 03:55:25,000
That would have been fine.

3730
03:55:25,000 --> 03:55:33,000
Damn it.

3731
03:55:33,000 --> 03:55:35,000
I wanted to beat Isaac.

3732
03:55:35,000 --> 03:55:37,000
I was just chilling.

3733
03:55:37,000 --> 03:55:41,000
That wasn't a- that was a very, very incredible build, but I will say it.

3734
03:55:41,000 --> 03:55:43,000
I will say it. I said it before, I'll say it again.

3735
03:55:43,000 --> 03:55:47,000
Going into the chest with less than like two or three hearts, you're pre-

3736
03:55:47,000 --> 03:55:53,000
It's- it's- you have a huge, huge, huge percentage that you're just going to lose.

3737
03:55:53,000 --> 03:56:03,000
Especially those- those rooms with like two or three of those big horrible bosses.

3738
03:56:03,000 --> 03:56:05,000
They're very, very hard.

3739
03:56:05,000 --> 03:56:13,000
Especially those two. It had to be that fucking guy who spawns the turkeys that shoot in fucking four directions.

3740
03:56:21,000 --> 03:56:25,000
I didn't forget about it in third year.

3741
03:56:25,000 --> 03:56:27,000
I'm taking broom baby.

3742
03:56:27,000 --> 03:56:31,000
I'm not even- this is not even a real run. This is a fake run.

3743
03:56:31,000 --> 03:56:37,000
I'm just venting my frustrations about the red poo hit boxes.

3744
03:56:41,000 --> 03:56:43,000
If we all saw- we all saw it.

3745
03:56:43,000 --> 03:56:47,000
I don't have to pretend like something happened. We all saw what happened.

3746
03:56:49,000 --> 03:56:53,000
I'm going to call the gamer police on- on those guys.

3747
03:56:55,000 --> 03:56:59,000
I'm going to- I'm going to call Ed.

3748
03:56:59,000 --> 03:57:03,000
He can be like, Ed, just go on out those hit boxes man.

3749
03:57:05,000 --> 03:57:09,000
I'm upset about it. He's going to go, okay.

3750
03:57:09,000 --> 03:57:13,000
And then we're going to the hit. I'm going to hit. We're going to hang up.

3751
03:57:13,000 --> 03:57:23,000
This is not even- this is a fake run.

3752
03:57:23,000 --> 03:57:37,000
This is- I'm pissed off run. I'm very upset right now. I couldn't be more angry.

3753
03:57:43,000 --> 03:57:49,000
I just haven't really been streaming for the second time for four hours.

3754
03:57:49,000 --> 03:57:51,000
Really?

3755
03:57:55,000 --> 03:57:57,000
This is a fake run.

3756
03:58:05,000 --> 03:58:09,000
Don't wish little, but you know I can't wish little. You're going to mock me like that.

3757
03:58:09,000 --> 03:58:11,000
He's only doing that because he knows I can't do it.

3758
03:58:11,000 --> 03:58:13,000
I haven't even fucking real.

3759
03:58:31,000 --> 03:58:35,000
The term is very irritated right now.

3760
03:58:35,000 --> 03:58:45,000
I'm going to uninstall Isaac, but I never said I couldn't reinstall it immediately after.

3761
03:58:45,000 --> 03:58:51,000
I can uninstall Isaac and then immediately reinstall it.

3762
03:58:51,000 --> 03:58:55,000
I can take the game or license test again.

3763
03:58:55,000 --> 03:58:59,000
So what? So I failed- oh yeah, you failed your driver's ed test.

3764
03:58:59,000 --> 03:59:03,000
You can go- you try it again in like another six months.

3765
03:59:03,000 --> 03:59:07,000
You can pass it. I can get my game or license back.

3766
03:59:07,000 --> 03:59:11,000
I'm just going to take the test again.

3767
03:59:23,000 --> 03:59:25,000
Fair enough.

3768
03:59:25,000 --> 03:59:33,000
There's a great response. Fair enough.

3769
03:59:55,000 --> 03:59:57,000
I'm sorry.

3770
03:59:57,000 --> 03:59:59,000
Fuck.

3771
03:59:59,000 --> 04:00:03,000
So much stuff.

3772
04:00:03,000 --> 04:00:07,000
So much shit just fucked out of it.

3773
04:00:15,000 --> 04:00:19,000
I knew that was going to happen.

3774
04:00:19,000 --> 04:00:23,000
I did that on purpose. You guys were going to go, oh you should have done me.

3775
04:00:23,000 --> 04:00:25,000
I can kill you.

3776
04:00:27,000 --> 04:00:31,000
I did- there was a joke.

3777
04:00:35,000 --> 04:00:37,000
Hold on a second.

3778
04:00:37,000 --> 04:00:39,000
I'm going to get my game or license back.

3779
04:00:39,000 --> 04:00:43,000
I'm going to go take my game or test again.

3780
04:00:43,000 --> 04:00:47,000
Hold on a second. I'm going to take my game or license test.

3781
04:00:53,000 --> 04:00:57,000
I can't believe you just unlocked the scissors.

3782
04:00:57,000 --> 04:01:01,000
Why did I not have the scissors?

3783
04:01:01,000 --> 04:01:03,000
I have like 75 hours in this game.

3784
04:01:03,000 --> 04:01:07,000
How do I not have the scissors?

3785
04:01:07,000 --> 04:01:11,000
That's frickin- I don't know how that's possible.

3786
04:01:13,000 --> 04:01:17,000
That was a fake run, guys.

3787
04:01:17,000 --> 04:01:19,000
There's no real run.

3788
04:01:29,000 --> 04:01:35,000
I need to do something to get my game or license back.

3789
04:01:35,000 --> 04:01:37,000
Let's see. What can I do?

3790
04:01:37,000 --> 04:01:41,000
I can go to prove to you guys that I can get my game or license back.

3791
04:01:41,000 --> 04:01:45,000
After just getting it revoked.

3792
04:01:45,000 --> 04:01:49,000
I just crashed into a mailbox and they took away my license.

3793
04:02:03,000 --> 04:02:05,000
You alright, if I?

3794
04:02:09,000 --> 04:02:13,000
Your license has been revoked.

3795
04:02:15,000 --> 04:02:25,000
I just tried to parallel park and I drove over the curb four times.

3796
04:02:25,000 --> 04:02:29,000
I tried to play it off like it didn't happen.

3797
04:02:31,000 --> 04:02:35,000
The guy doing that was doing my driver's ed test.

3798
04:02:35,000 --> 04:02:39,000
He kept on going, okay, just squicked it out.

3799
04:02:39,000 --> 04:02:41,000
You know what exactly what he's thinking.

3800
04:02:41,000 --> 04:02:43,000
This dude failed the test.

3801
04:02:43,000 --> 04:02:47,000
You know, like, you go over the curb and he's just like, it's okay.

3802
04:02:47,000 --> 04:02:49,000
Just took straight knit out, please.

3803
04:02:49,000 --> 04:02:53,000
And the whole time he's sitting there going, I failed.

3804
04:02:53,000 --> 04:02:55,000
I failed it.

3805
04:02:55,000 --> 04:02:57,000
And then you really get an all worked up about it.

3806
04:02:57,000 --> 04:02:59,000
So you straighten out and you back over the curb again.

3807
04:02:59,000 --> 04:03:01,000
And then he hits the brake that he has on his car.

3808
04:03:01,000 --> 04:03:05,000
You know, like I can put the brake on whenever I want on his passenger side.

3809
04:03:05,000 --> 04:03:09,000
And he makes you get out of the car and then he does it for you.

3810
04:03:09,000 --> 04:03:11,000
And then he's like, okay, that was all right.

3811
04:03:11,000 --> 04:03:13,000
Up until that point.

3812
04:03:13,000 --> 04:03:15,000
Yeah.

3813
04:03:15,000 --> 04:03:17,000
All right.

3814
04:03:17,000 --> 04:03:19,000
Let me see.

3815
04:03:19,000 --> 04:03:23,000
Give me a second, guys.

3816
04:03:23,000 --> 04:03:27,000
I think I know just the way to get my gamer license back.

3817
04:03:31,000 --> 04:03:33,000
There's just a second here.

3818
04:03:33,000 --> 04:03:35,000
Just one second here.

3819
04:03:41,000 --> 04:03:45,000
Submit a urine sample to Janet.

3820
04:03:45,000 --> 04:03:47,000
Yeah, I'm going to piss in a jar.

3821
04:03:47,000 --> 04:03:49,000
And you guys could test it, Steve.

3822
04:03:49,000 --> 04:03:51,000
Does that get a gaming plasma in it?

3823
04:03:51,000 --> 04:03:53,000
I think you guys are going to hear this.

3824
04:03:53,000 --> 04:03:57,000
And you're going to know how we're going to get our gamer license back.

3825
04:03:57,000 --> 04:03:59,000
That's right.

3826
04:04:13,000 --> 04:04:15,000
That's right.

3827
04:04:19,000 --> 04:04:21,000
Super 8 Boy.

3828
04:04:23,000 --> 04:04:25,000
Let's go.

3829
04:04:25,000 --> 04:04:30,000
All I gotta do to get my gamer license back all I gotta do I

3830
04:04:32,000 --> 04:04:36,000
Just got a beat the first level of meat boy

3831
04:04:38,000 --> 04:04:40,000
In ten seconds

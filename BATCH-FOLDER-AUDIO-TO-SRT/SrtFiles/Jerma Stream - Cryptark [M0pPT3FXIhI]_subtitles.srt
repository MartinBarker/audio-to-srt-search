1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey, good afternoon guys. How you doing? Good afternoon.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I think we're ready to go.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello. So I got to apologize right off the bat. This I'm in my new office kind of area in this place.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And I'm in the process of putting up like sound panels, but it's still a little echoey in here. So I got to, uh, gotta say sorry.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Until that's all done, it's going to be a little roomy in here by you know, whatever.

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:24,000
My new, yeah, my this is the office where I get new it is my new office. I just get new in here.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Alright, so today, what's tonight? We're going to play a cryptarch. It's a game that came out in early access. Not that long ago a couple days ago or so.

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a kind of rogue like space shooter sort of twin stick bullet hell type game. That's kind of a weird way to describe it. It's not really that it's more like a try to take money from spaceship game.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I actually really don't even know I have no idea. I just know what I've read about it.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But apparently very good things I've heard extremely good things about this game. And there's no reason why we'll play in this game too. This is another very specific reason why we're going to play this game.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You'll see very soon.

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Do you like my hold on a second screen?

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I did literally drew this in less than 15 seconds.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So we'll let some people trickle in before we do this.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Can I sell your DNA on the internet for money?

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, no.

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, that's it. That's pretty fucked up.

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My initial question, would you get it? Where the hell did you get this?

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm not playing sticks. No, I'm not playing sticks.

20
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay, let me get this up.

21
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I actually have heard of keep talking. Nobody explodes seems really, really fun.

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't you need like three or four people to play that game though?

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a game we have like at least three people, right?

24
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Sometimes it's 1130 right now. 1126.

25
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Only two. You only need two people? That's pretty sweet.

26
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Maybe me and Stark have played at some point. Or somebody else who doesn't matter who it is.

27
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
007, I remember that 007 was such a good game.

28
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
First time, that was way ahead of its time.

29
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That FPS multiplayer type game that was never, it was the first of its kind really.

30
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It definitely matters who it is. Well, it doesn't really matter.

31
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You don't think that would be equally as entertaining with like boo or MLC stuff?

32
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Doesn't always have to be star guys. Plus star is in prison.

33
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
How am I going to play with them?

34
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Pax East is not till next year, man. Not till like April or something next year.

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
From March or whatever.

36
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, well, I'm going to get going.

37
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I just want to give it a minute or two so we can kind of trickle in.

38
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We're going to open this game up. This game is apparently very hard, so please don't be mad at me if I can't do this well.

39
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So let's do it.

40
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Let's see if I can get the hold on the second screen off.

41
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hey, look at that. There's a video game on the screen now.

42
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
All right. So let's play it. I don't know a whole lot.

43
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I know it's a shooter kind of side-scrolling top-down.

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Break in, steal the stuff, take the core, get out.

45
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I actually have played this game for like 30 seconds.

46
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't really know a whole lot, but I do know this.

47
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's take the last shot. Let's go ahead and do the tutorial.

48
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You know, sometimes when you start a new game up, how are you supposed to know how to play?

49
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You got to do the god damn tutorial.

50
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's watch.

51
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Look at those characters.

52
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let's go.

53
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Let's go.

54
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah, we are.

55
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't know nothing about this game.

56
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I just know like the first 30 seconds.

57
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So we're going to take over this ship.

58
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Difficulty 1 class envoy, goal time 407.

59
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's go ahead and launch.

60
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's load up this first level.

61
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Who the fuck's that?

62
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Who's this one?

63
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Who's this one?

64
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Who's this one?

65
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Who's this one?

66
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Alright, so this is what it looks like.

67
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's me.

68
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hold, eat open doors.

69
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Easy.

70
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The old gun handy is got four weapon hard points and four item brackets.

71
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, yeah, move the mouse to aim.

72
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The controls, it's pretty smooth.

73
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's pretty cool.

74
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's awkward.

75
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hard to even see where I'm going.

76
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Alright, grenade is F.

77
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I might rewind that.

78
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And that's the shield.

79
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Alright.

80
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The dash, the shield.

81
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Interesting.

82
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Why didn't you actually learn an extra terrestrial language to prepare for your role?

83
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Shameful display.

84
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay, let's see what we're looking at here.

85
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Now let's figure out a plan of attack.

86
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What about the map?

87
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is all important information that I'm learning for the first time.

88
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
First, this active shield system will have to be taken offline.

89
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It looks to be protective of core with some sort of energy field.

90
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Take out the shield.

91
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is kind of like the swindle.

92
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Right?

93
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
By the way, this is all procedurally generated, I believe.

94
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We can just take a look at this shield.

95
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It protects a single system with an impenetrable energy shield.

96
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So this is blocking this.

97
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Okay, so this has to go down before the core can be destroyed.

98
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Controls the multitude of interior defense turrets.

99
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So if I destroy this, there's turrets that are going to be here.

100
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This is locked.

101
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
All right, let's just go.

102
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Let's just play.

103
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Let's do it.

104
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
There's nothing else I can really do here.

105
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's my shield.

106
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I want to turn F.

107
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't want to make it something else if I can.

108
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I have a different button I'd like to do.

109
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No, I'm apparently going to need to use my other mouse.

110
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let's see, mouse 4.

111
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That works for me.

112
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Did I do it?

113
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Should have done it right.

114
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm going to reset it.

115
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah, I don't know why that didn't do it.

116
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Did I use all the grenades?

117
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Maybe I don't have any grenades left.

118
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Where's the indicator?

119
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Because that's mouse 4.

120
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's not working.

121
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Uh-oh.

122
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Now I'll just put it back to F.

123
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Whatever.

124
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'll put it down to Q.

125
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Maybe Q is probably easier.

126
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh, whoops.

127
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Q is my like change scene button.

128
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh shit.

129
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, I got to...

130
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Well, we definitely can't make it Q.

131
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, I don't know.

132
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I guess I just may have to deal with it.

133
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Because I can't get it to be mouse 4.

134
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Alright, let's just play.

135
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I've sit and have sat here long enough.

136
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Pioneer away.

137
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hey, equipment expenses logged.

138
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Start mission clock.

139
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Now, I believe there's a timer, yeah.

140
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh, shit.

141
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's going right now.

142
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Alright, I got it.

143
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I didn't even...

144
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I didn't even plan my attack.

145
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We're just going on the right in the front door.

146
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Okay, I get...

147
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The shield is up to the top left, right?

148
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Repair supply.

149
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't need to do that.

150
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Whoa, okay, they can't hurt you.

151
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
These are tarots.

152
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
These tarots aren't here, for sure.

153
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I got 1,400 of my machine gun, which is good.

154
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Here's the shield.

155
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh.

156
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Whoa.

157
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

158
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, it's a reflector.

159
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That's a reflector.

160
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay, I got it.

161
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You got to be real careful.

162
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm going to shoot some grenades in there.

163
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's the way to do it.

164
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I need to see that guy to the left.

165
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This is pretty damn cool though.

166
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What is that?

167
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's a piece of...

168
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I got to look at the Metroid mini map.

169
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Key terminal.

170
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I guess I got a key.

171
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Apparently.

172
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Is that another key?

173
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Let's open it up.

174
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Ooh, I can now open that.

175
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Okay, I got it, I get it.

176
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Help is in the bottom.

177
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The brain is up here, but I have like two minutes.

178
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Hey, I should go down and...

179
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay, tech advance.

180
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What does this do?

181
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay.

182
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So I pick these up to get better shit.

183
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Thanks me.

184
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Thanks for telling me how to play.

185
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I am running out of time.

186
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
No.

187
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't get anymore ammo after this.

188
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I probably should just try to do the first little tutorial area first.

189
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Up here, right?

190
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah, there it is.

191
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Here's the brain.

192
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I only got a minute and 40 seconds left.

193
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I gotta get these little shits out of their parts.

194
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's his port.

195
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is like quadrants of the brain.

196
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That's pretty sick.

197
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Ow.

198
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

199
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh boy, not good, not good, not good.

200
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Probably should have taken out the turret system.

201
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh boy.

202
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You're getting lit up like a white ball!

203
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Activate one of those repair kits.

204
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll get you a repair pod and patch up my shoot.

205
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Oh shit, I'm getting yelled at.

206
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So I gotta go to...

207
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Okay, repair pod.

208
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Are these things spawning from somewhere?

209
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I thought I killed these guys.

210
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Okay, I have one on me.

211
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Okay, I gotta get it.

212
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
There we go.

213
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Now I got free reign to kill the brain.

214
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Boink.

215
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Got the code.

216
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah, I just scoled him by self.

217
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's the next level scoled him.

218
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
All right.

219
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
We've got a starting budget of 500k for equipment and weapons.

220
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But we'll pull in more funds for each boat we capture.

221
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Just don't get sloppy.

222
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You crash and burn out there and we'll get slapped with the expenses.

223
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If we go into the red, our contract gets torched.

224
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
All right.

225
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So it costs money to attack.

226
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Difficulty one.

227
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
These are all fairly simple except for that one.

228
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
These are both harder.

229
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No supply pods.

230
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
These are those little bonuses.

231
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's cool.

232
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
They use dollars instead of galactic credits.

233
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh, this is unrealistic.

234
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
94,000.

235
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm gonna stay with the baby ships because I'm still learning the game.

236
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Tech advances for what was the discode that the cheapest one.

237
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I got about five minutes to beat it.

238
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
All along don't highly guarded multiple factory systems.

239
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
All right.

240
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Hey, look at us.

241
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
We got a bit of new equipment licenses.

242
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We're getting a load on right here and I'll get you all cared up, Sunny.

243
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, that part was adlib.

244
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You see there was no sunny there.

245
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Whatever the actor over the brilliant actor was, added that little part of the end there.

246
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Just a little bit of an insight.

247
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
All right.

248
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Let's get down to business.

249
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You got four weapon points.

250
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I can carry whatever hardware we got licenses for.

251
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I can modify the amount of whole durability your suit has as well.

252
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Polternaut and extra plating can get pricey though.

253
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I can't wait to see the item bracket.

254
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's gonna be loaded up with whatever good news you think might come in handy.

255
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So humble.

256
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm just kidding.

257
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's a joke.

258
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
We're just joking here.

259
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Okay.

260
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So what do I have here?

261
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
This is 36,000.

262
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I can...

263
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Where's my money?

264
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I can also...

265
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Can I sell it too?

266
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm just gonna go with default now.

267
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So this is what I can put here.

268
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I got all the elements catalog by type.

269
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Be sure to let me know how much ammo you want for each gun too.

270
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
These things get hungry out there.

271
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm trying to just let you die.

272
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So I can get keys.

273
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I can bring a nuke.

274
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm gonna keep the fix.

275
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Two fixes.

276
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What's the key?

277
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So I can get through one key and it's $8,000.

278
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't think I can do one fix.

279
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I should be all right.

280
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What else we got here?

281
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh geez.

282
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
There's even more weapons.

283
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The spike is cool, but...

284
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Okay, shotgun.

285
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
224K.

286
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Let me try the shotgun.

287
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We'll go with 200.

288
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Now we're gonna go with 100.

289
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Just to guess I don't like it.

290
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah, 50.

291
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Just in case I hate it.

292
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So the machine gun that's fine, although maybe...

293
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
1500 is fine.

294
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Shield should probably stay there.

295
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It helps.

296
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Bombs.

297
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We're gonna stake the shield.

298
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Here are the grenades.

299
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Sticky grenades.

300
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I was barely using these, so I'm just gonna...

301
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm gonna say zero.

302
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm gonna save a little more.

303
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm gonna get more bang for a buck.

304
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm gonna try the shotgun and I will put on another thing of health.

305
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Maybe two more things to help.

306
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I get $500,000.

307
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I get $69,000 for beating this.

308
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So maybe I shouldn't be doing that.

309
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm just gonna be in the red.

310
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Fuck it, whatever.

311
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Who cares?

312
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's the way we're gonna do it.

313
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Where did I go?

314
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
There it is.

315
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh, cool.

316
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So I can just use them.

317
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Ooh, I like the shotgun.

318
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Shotguns actually pretty damn cool.

319
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I think I'm liking this.

320
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I think I am.

321
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I like the shotgun.

322
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm gonna try shotgun shotty guy.

323
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What the fuck is this?

324
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What the fuck is this?

325
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm gonna try shotgun shotty guy.

326
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What the fuck is this?

327
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
What the fuck is this?

328
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
How did I get connected with this game?

329
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
This is actually made by the same people that made a Pothion.

330
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Alien trap.

331
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And the guy that was the casting director for Pothion is a guy that I have to know from the old voice acting communities.

332
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And he got me in touch again.

333
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
He I auditioned.

334
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And they liked it.

335
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So I'm in the game.

336
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's pretty much it.

337
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Let's go steal some stuff.

338
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Let's go blow up a core.

339
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Alright, let's look at this.

340
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I mean, this is important.

341
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Here's the core.

342
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Alarm system.

343
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So that protects the core.

344
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
This is gonna be kind of harder.

345
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Well, this is tiny.

346
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This is a little one, huh?

347
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
This is a little baby ship.

348
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I forgot.

349
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So if I go in this door, no, no.

350
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
If I go in this door.

351
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
This is the thing that spawns enemies.

352
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm gonna come in the back door, destroy the thing that spawns the enemies.

353
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Then, wrap around this way, come up to destroy the alarm system.

354
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And then, core gets taken out.

355
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Nothing but net.

356
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Let's go.

357
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay, confirm loadout.

358
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
88,000.

359
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I feel like this is very wasteful.

360
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But I'll learn that as we go.

361
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I only have four and a half minutes.

362
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Right in the back door.

363
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Oh, lots of people down here.

364
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Holy shit, everybody.

365
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
This thing up above has hit me.

366
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm freaking out.

367
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I calm down.

368
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I gotta calm down here.

369
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I went way too fast.

370
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I should've just slowed down.

371
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That's a good amount of health.

372
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh shit, alarm triggered.

373
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
What?

374
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What am I?

375
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Careful about tripping those alarm sensors.

376
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I see multiple contacts converging on your position.

377
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah, I did all those laser effects.

378
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah, all these sound effects in here I did them with my mouth.

379
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
No, that's not true.

380
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
They're very talented sound designs on this game.

381
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
That's what they're actors.

382
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm taking away too many hits here.

383
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
There goes that.

384
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Whoa, what the fuck is happening to my character?

385
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm getting pulled in and I just got sucked in.

386
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
All right, note this out.

387
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
They suck you in.

388
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Don't turn off.

389
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Tech.

390
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Key.

391
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Fuck.

392
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Give me that heal.

393
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Damn.

394
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh, I can't hurt the brain, but it triggers the alarm.

395
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm out of repairs.

396
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So maybe I should have brought.

397
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I thought that was five.

398
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
No, okay, I get enough.

399
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That's five health points, not five in the slot.

400
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I don't think there's so many enemies there are.

401
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Quick hit, get that tech upgrade.

402
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
That's what I should have just said right there.

403
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I think we're just gonna go for it.

404
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I think we're just gonna go for it.

405
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Just destroy it.

406
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Pull it out.

407
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm dead.

408
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Okay, all right, get it.

409
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I just lost a budget.

410
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I just lost 100 grand.

411
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Shit.

412
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
That was cool, though.

413
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Now that I know how that works and now we're back here,

414
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and I believe these are all generated again.

415
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
We're gonna go with the baby one again.

416
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
This time I'm gonna put multiple heals in.

417
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Now I know, triggering that, that the alarm switches,

418
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
it's pretty planned, didn't work.

419
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Okay, let's go down, get another heal.

420
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That's $10,000.

421
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I think in an upgrade, what is this sensor?

422
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Deepwave Red Arverse Scepter is in advance.

423
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Mold-Bat, tunneling processor, a lot of the sensor package

424
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
to reveal a lighter area.

425
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I don't think I need that yet.

426
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
15 grand for a nuke, I don't know.

427
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'd rather just get another heal just because I'm a fucking shitty.

428
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I might as well reset.

429
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
By the way, this is kind of like a rogue like.

430
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
When you're out of money, I believe the game is over.

431
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm already down 100k.

432
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Still have the shotgun.

433
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Still have the shield.

434
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And we'll go with that.

435
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
This time I'm gonna be a little bit more careful.

436
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
God, that was a lot of money.

437
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
This one's the layout is a little different.

438
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Brain is down here at this time.

439
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Alright, I'm just gonna be more, I got way too gong-ho.

440
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I just went straight in.

441
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's locked.

442
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Just gotta be careful.

443
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You just slow it down.

444
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It's kind of like binding a Isaac.

445
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You don't just run in the room and run around like a fucking psychopath.

446
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Couple of tech upgrades here.

447
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Key.

448
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
There you go.

449
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Let's open his door.

450
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
This is where the turrets are being shot.

451
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Clear out the little, clear out the trash.

452
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Have you learned anything from World of Warcraft?

453
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Clear out the trash.

454
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Okay, that's gonna pully.

455
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
That's gonna be hard to do.

456
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
This is scary.

457
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Alright, Sentry systems are now destroyed.

458
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I can move freely without getting aggro from them.

459
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
That's tech upgrade in here.

460
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I don't have key though.

461
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Is it now?

462
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Oh, no I do.

463
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Only a minute and a half left, I gotta keep going.

464
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm running out of time.

465
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm running out of time.

466
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's have and have not.

467
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
This is a game of halves and have nots.

468
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Am I going the right way?

469
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Nope.

470
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Not even close.

471
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm just letting go through here.

472
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Is there a way to get in this back way?

473
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I would pull a planning.

474
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
One minute.

475
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
No, there's no way I'm gonna do this in one minute.

476
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Fuck it.

477
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
We gotta go.

478
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I have 45 seconds to kill the brain.

479
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Wow, time is not on your side in this game.

480
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Go soundly alone, don't give a shit.

481
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
30 seconds.

482
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
45 seconds, go on.

483
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Thank God.

484
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Phew.

485
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Damn.

486
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So my revenue was 100 and how much did I spend?

487
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
100 and something thousand?

488
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So my actual net like actual gain was like 30 thousand dollars.

489
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
This is pretty cool.

490
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
This is pretty cool.

491
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I will say I am.

492
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, would you look at that?

493
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
That's why this is cool.

494
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So you have a choice between four ships.

495
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You can either spend a little bit more money

496
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
do the really hard ones.

497
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Because you have to go through these five slots.

498
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You can do one, two, three, four, five.

499
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And then you get to the crypt.

500
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Let's go with the hard one.

501
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Let's just see.

502
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm just curious.

503
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Now I'm gonna get my ass kicked.

504
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But I'm curious to see what like a three difficulty one is like.

505
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm sure they go up to 10 or something.

506
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Think of all the slabs of granite you could have bought with that money.

507
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Quite a few.

508
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
We're gonna do the really, really ultra super level two hard one.

509
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
This one looks pretty big too.

510
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Six and a half minutes.

511
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Destroy the sensor jammers for an extra 34k.

512
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Let's just go for it.

513
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:13,000
We got another, we got another tutorial.

514
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Oh no, we don't.

515
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:31,000
What do I have for this heavy machine gun ricochet?

516
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Lots of recoil but they ricochet the bullets ricochet.

517
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
How much is the price difference?

518
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
The machine gun burst smart.

519
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Ooh.

520
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The advanced smart gun.

521
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The zip gun?

522
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Let's go with the zip gun.

523
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
How much money is the zip gun comparison?

524
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
No, if I have much more zip gun.

525
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:17,000
3000 bolts.

526
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Am I gonna stay with the shotgun?

527
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yeah, it's kind of tried and true, right?

528
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Probably bolts 50, 50's been working pretty well.

529
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
You could probably even go lower.

530
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
No, you can only go 50.

531
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Actually, I wanna put this on.

532
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Okay, let's do 10 grenades on mouse three.

533
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Most two, no, no, no, no, no, no.

534
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
That shield is too good.

535
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You can't take this off.

536
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
What does this do?

537
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Blaster?

538
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,000
If the zip gun isn't voice acted by Jermami, I'm gonna stay with the shield for now.

539
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I should take grenades but I wish I could just change the key bind.

540
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
F is kind of awkward to press when most 90% of the stuff you're doing is on the mouse.

541
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But whatever.

542
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Didn't I find something else here?

543
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
No.

544
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Now that I know what the hell's going on, I think I'm okay with having one of these fixers.

545
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I barely took any damage that last run.

546
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Now that I know, not to be a psychopath about everything.

547
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You can even take this down.

548
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Okay, so if you were confident enough, you could save yourself like $40,000 if you knew you were gonna hit more than one time.

549
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Or two times.

550
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Where's it gonna go with, you know what I'm gonna go with eight?

551
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
This is a $74,000 mission.

552
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I get 141 if I beat it and the bonuses.

553
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Let's just get our asses kicked, why not?

554
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Let's take a look at what we're dealing with.

555
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Oh fuck.

556
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Oh, that's evil.

557
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So I guess I could take one of those sensors, right?

558
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I don't have those things.

559
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I don't have those things.

560
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I gotta do.

561
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
$8,000 to be able to see not that far in front of me.

562
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Let's try it.

563
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
We'll go for it.

564
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I think does that mean I can see things now?

565
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Okay, so this thing will repair other things that I destroyed.

566
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So that thing's gotta go.

567
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
What is this? That's the jammer.

568
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:32,000
If there's a way to get in right here, or like here, I can grab the intel, take out the drone factory, repair system, come around.

569
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Poke the thing in the eye.

570
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Rip around, get rid of the turret system, swoop, shoot, bang, shield, generate it down, and the alarm system down.

571
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Thank you very much. I'll take my 200 rent.

572
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You heard it here first.

573
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So that's what that does.

574
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Is it door right here? What do you know?

575
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
We're gonna be good to go.

576
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
We're gonna be good to go.

577
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
At least that's loud.

578
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm sorry, everybody. That's very loud.

579
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Say it's the dip gun.

580
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Oh god, forgot. I forgot where am I.

581
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Oh, that just totally ruined my whole plan.

582
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Get me out of here.

583
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Fuck that.

584
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Bye. I'm going back to my original plan.

585
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Can I?

586
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Shit. Come on. There's got to be like a secret entrance up here I can break through, right?

587
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
There it is.

588
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Ow!

589
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,000
This is dip gun is sick.

590
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We're going for speed.

591
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:13,000
French gun.

592
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Hard to shoot the zip gun in here because it's so inaccurate.

593
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
There it goes. Where's the brain?

594
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Okay, brain.

595
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Fuck.

596
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Easy, easy careful.

597
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I got five minutes to do this.

598
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I can probably...

599
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I might not... I don't think I'm going to get the brain just yet.

600
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I got... I went through the secret entrance.

601
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Throwing factory... oh shit.

602
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
No, we're gonna go.

603
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Is that gonna shield me?

604
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Hope not.

605
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I think I can hurt you this side yet.

606
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,000
That's not good.

607
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,000
No, now it's good.

608
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
All right.

609
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
No, I got three health.

610
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Three HP in no way.

611
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yeah, I didn't take out the repair thing because my everything got all screwed up.

612
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Look at that money.

613
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
No supply pods. I didn't destroy the jammers.

614
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
297K.

615
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I'll take it.

616
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Attention crew. We're moving deeper into the flotilla and getting closer to the cryptarch.

617
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Expect higher resistance.

618
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
All right, I'm messing around.

619
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm pretty sure the only reason why I'm alive is he probably dude.

620
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
That's probably true.

621
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
These are bigger.

622
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I don't know man.

623
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
What's the difference between these?

624
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
These ones more money but...

625
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
There must just be more stuff.

626
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:49,000
See, all those icons in the lower right, I don't even know what the hell any of those mean.

627
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
We'll play this one a little bit safer.

628
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Three, five, five.

629
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Would Benjamin Franklin have taken this like a safe the safe way?

630
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
No, he would have people to start off the fucking goddamn revolution and been like the best president we've ever had.

631
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
We're going with the danger of five.

632
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
How do you think he got on that hundred?

633
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Did he get got on that hundred by like taking a bath?

634
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,000
No, he was the best electric president we've ever had.

635
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Benjamin Franklin wasn't a president.

636
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
He, but who cares?

637
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Only damn president on the money that's not on the money, you know, that's all the money.

638
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Yeah.

639
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I got a new weapon. Let's take a look at what it is.

640
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I do like the zip gun.

641
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Trench gun.

642
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Sawed off double-barrowed shotgun.

643
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Slowed or reload?

644
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Nothing compares to a brutal one-two punch.

645
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
What if I do double shotgun?

646
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That sounds kind of fun, right?

647
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
If we're doing a hard one, no, I don't know.

648
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
That doesn't seem like a good idea.

649
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Try the other guns. Advanced smart gun.

650
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It's too expensive.

651
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Is it really worth it to have like a home, this one's homing.

652
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And it's almost fifteen thousand twelve thousand dollars less expensive for more bullets.

653
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
We'll get a try.

654
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I feel like that's not enough though.

655
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
We'll go with the default.

656
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And we'll do the shot off shotgun.

657
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Can't take the shield off. It's too good.

658
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I don't even care. I don't even like the sensor.

659
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
That's eight thousand dollars I don't need to spend.

660
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
At least not now.

661
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Should I do it?

662
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I could have double zipped on.

663
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And blow everybody's eardrums out.

664
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'll keep it on. This is a big job.

665
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I like the key.

666
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I don't care about the grenades.

667
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's money I don't have to spend.

668
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I feel like I'm gonna run out of ammo.

669
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But it cares.

670
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm gonna be a millionaire after this one anyways.

671
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Uh oh.

672
00:44:44,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm really what does that mean?

673
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Okay this gun is pretty amazing.

674
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You can just go like this and shoot around corners.

675
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I'm blotting. Look at how much ammo I'm blowing though.

676
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Whoa.

677
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
That's gone in the game.

678
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
So out off shotgun is probably the best.

679
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Look at this thing. Look at the spread.

680
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I like this loadout.

681
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Oh it's stealthy. You like the voice?

682
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Let's go.

683
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
There's a lot of enemies here.

684
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Look at that.

685
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's tiny.

686
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
This one is so small.

687
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
There's a ton of enemies but it's tiny.

688
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Provides all drones aboard this ship with additional 25% health.

689
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Shit.

690
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
There's the point of entry.

691
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Ooh.

692
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
This one's multiple ships connected together.

693
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
How much time do I have seven and a half minutes?

694
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Take it slow.

695
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I got a key. I can go right in here.

696
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Let's go.

697
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Actually, hold on.

698
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I can't get it. Yeah, I can.

699
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I have a key.

700
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Is this scary?

701
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'm scared of opening this door.

702
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah, there's their shield.

703
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Wow.

704
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Oh, it's in every direction.

705
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Why did I do this one?

706
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Why did I do this to this hard one?

707
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I should have taken like the fucking Alexander fan grant.

708
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
What her first name was.

709
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
What was the name?

710
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Anthony Grant.

711
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
What was that president?

712
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Oh my god.

713
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Get me out of here.

714
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Oh my god, my game is crashing.

715
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
They're following me out of the ship.

716
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Oh, wow.

717
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That was not prepared for that one.

718
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Ulysses S. Grant.

719
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
That was like a general.

720
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
That wasn't even a president.

721
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
They can't hurt me if I'm out here.

722
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Not like that.

723
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Just get away from these guys.

724
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Jesus.

725
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Tech, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech uppers.

726
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Chain gun.

727
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
This thing has a shield.

728
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
This is bad.

729
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Are those green bubbles?

730
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
What's next?

731
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Huge knockback.

732
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Why do I...

733
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
All right, their armor is down.

734
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Those turrets are unbearable.

735
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Oh boy.

736
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
That's it.

737
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Wait, is it not in?

738
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Is that not it?

739
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
That's not it.

740
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So there's like a left for dead style.

741
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,000
One last chance playing in this game.

742
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I can't tell any of his health whenever this is bad.

743
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I'm dead.

744
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
How much money did I just lose?

745
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:13,000
That hurts.

746
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I was going to get a poster of Benjamin Franklin

747
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and put him up on this wall back here.

748
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Now I'm going to get a poster of Dan Bush.

749
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Like George Bush is like seventh cousin.

750
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Or like Bill Clinton.

751
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You know what?

752
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I think I'm going to get a Bill Clinton poster.

753
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Is it like a Bill Clinton poster with a cigar in his hand?

754
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Probably.

755
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Is it like just like leaning back like smiling with a cigar?

756
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Benjamin fucking Franklin.

757
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Unbelievable.

758
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Well, we lost a bunch of money.

759
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:07,000
That one was very, very, very, very hard.

760
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Is there four or is it just three in five?

761
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I'll do it three.

762
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I'm not quite there yet to do the advanced level five ones.

763
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I don't think the uh...

764
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:33,000
That Tracer Gundon shoot really fast enough for me.

765
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Oh, I got into weapon.

766
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I got a chain gun, right?

767
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Let's try that one.

768
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:48,000
You lost 100,000 Berger boys, not Bugafot.

769
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I don't know why that's so funny to me.

770
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Bugafot, not Bugafot.

771
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
That's great.

772
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,000
One spinning, they deliver a hurricane of weathering fire.

773
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Let's try it.

774
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I still like this shotgun, the uh...

775
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
The Tracer Gundon.

776
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Do they make something else?

777
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I'm saying like something else could be here that I'm just not missing.

778
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The zip gun was a good choice too.

779
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Let's try the chain gun.

780
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
No, but this is level three.

781
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
This is not level five.

782
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Keep these.

783
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I'm going to take another key.

784
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Just because how much are the keys?

785
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Whatever.

786
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
One, two, three.

787
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
One, two, three, four, five.

788
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I'm going to do seven strength.

789
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
That's a bad idea.

790
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Bad idea, but you know, I'm going to do it anyways.

791
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Yeah!

792
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It starts off slow.

793
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Then you get into face melting category in like two seconds.

794
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I like it.

795
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
We're staying with it.

796
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
This one, I didn't even look at it.

797
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I was pretty dumb.

798
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm going to go in this door over here.

799
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Go in this door, grab the key, make my way up, try to destroy the shield and the alarm.

800
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Because that also requires a key to get in there.

801
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Get a couple of these tech upgrades to go down, swing all the way down inside the puzzle piece into the core.

802
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Let's go.

803
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It's going to be a long trip to go all the way around.

804
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
But it's worth it.

805
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
At least I think.

806
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I hope.

807
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
How many lines did I record for this game?

808
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I think like 40, 50, 30, something like that.

809
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:34,000
More than a handful, I would say.

810
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Things get kind of like unwieldy.

811
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Take the key, let's go up.

812
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I don't need to be bringing that many keys.

813
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I already have three.

814
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Here we go.

815
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:08,000
This is going to set off the alarm.

816
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Having the double barrel shotgun shoot twice is going to kill me.

817
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And.

818
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Get in there.

819
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

820
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I'm going to have to hang out in there.

821
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I'm going to have to hang out there.

822
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I'll scramble into this one room.

823
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Is corpsman going to dissipate if I don't touch them for a while?

824
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Where's the repair drone?

825
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
No.

826
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
No.

827
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I forgot that this thing existed.

828
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Where is it?

829
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Is it this far down?

830
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
It's that far down.

831
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Should have done this first.

832
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Look back planning.

833
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It's okay.

834
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
How much time do I got?

835
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Three minutes.

836
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
It's alright.

837
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I just worked myself.

838
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Shit.

839
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Shithead, put your shield down.

840
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Can I not kill these things?

841
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Oh

842
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Not a bad one

843
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Oh, no

844
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Oh, no

845
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Get these like snakes these little sperms get out of here

846
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I'm out of ammo on every gun

847
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
You

848
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
You got yet you called it not in a famo I heard it I didn't I didn't I should have I

849
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Really liked this game

850
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
This is this is really really cool

851
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Well we're officially lost almost all the money that I have in my bank

852
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Chain gun I I'm gonna have to go back to tried and true zip gun man

853
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Let's go

854
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Am I not I got a couple of new things but

855
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Could do double zip gun. Let's you know we're gonna try it. We'll try double zip gun

856
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Wonder if it's even possible

857
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Yes, you the chip look at how much money that is no wonder it's that much money because you can just spam it

858
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Okay, heavy machine gun piercing

859
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
High fire that's a piercing ammunition auto stabilizer

860
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
He brings suit so this is slows you down a lot

861
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah, do we even need to read that or we just get in two zip guns

862
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
You know what I mean actually we really need to like read any of that shit

863
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
That's awesome. Oh, that's so cool

864
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
That's enough ammo too, I think

865
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
All right

866
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
That is gonna be enough ammo I hope

867
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Don't need two keys you get keys pretty easily sensors. Okay to stay

868
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I'll keep the one key the one healer and now we've got double zip gun

869
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
So the game's pretty much over you know

870
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Then many things are gonna get now way now there and they're insane

871
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Now let me think about this for a second rather than just

872
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Be a moron and say oh, yes, it's connected to this and now I go

873
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
This is repair system

874
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
This has to go this thing has to go first

875
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Otherwise if I destroy this it doesn't matter

876
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Although yeah, if I destroy this it won't matter like all those repair facilities these things have to go

877
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
So there's one in here there's only one

878
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
So we got to go down and then we got to go all the way back up again up to here or even right over to here

879
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
So this is the point of entry actually this is good because the turrets thing is right here

880
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
We got double zip gun. We're going in that spot right there to the lower right

881
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Let's go

882
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
We're almost out of money so this is our last chance to pull this out of the fire oh shit. We're out of money

883
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,000
If we don't deliver the ship to the contractors we'll be out of a job and that's where the game ends

884
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
All right, I can't lose this one. I physically cannot lose this otherwise the game's over

885
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So you know what they say

886
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Oh

887
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Move move move

888
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I got places to be places to be

889
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I got a key I can open the store good

890
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Fuck you

891
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
All right

892
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,000
All right keep moving we have this is a must win this is a must win situation

893
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
We're only gonna do one zip on trigger a cheap forgetting about that

894
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Don't want to run out of the ammo

895
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I got plenty of time show

896
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
What's happening what happened would I go

897
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
How do you not get by those

898
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Let's go

899
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I got I got yeah, I got like a thousand rounds

900
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Fuckin hard to blow in this whole thing

901
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Like a wagon

902
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Is the brain

903
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Is this shield all right, I get a chill for a second. I'm rolling out of ammo. Is there any able to you guys see an ammo pod me work?

904
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I can't really look in the map

905
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Shit

906
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Is it gonna be so hard to hit this and not get hit I get up to stand so close and just go like this

907
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
It's cuz it's gonna reflect it right in my face

908
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Brain I got a full minute and a half

909
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Slow down slow down

910
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Each shit down to one down to one zip gun

911
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I can't even tell I can't even tell this stupid motherfucker right here

912
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Oh

913
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Oh wow, I thought I lost it right at the end we live another day

914
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:15,000
You know what I bet you after a couple more seconds of that it would have lost I would have lost again

915
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Nice

916
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Okay, well there's that

917
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Double zip gun all the way it was all double zip gun

918
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:36,000
For zip gun, it's probably possible. I don't know if I have the money

919
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Class five class to work to six now

920
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I'm gonna be able to beat that with the amount of money that I need to save

921
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
You know

922
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Many multiple heals a key

923
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Now you know, let's try it. I'm gonna spend my entire bank account

924
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
This is a huge payout if I can beat this though

925
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I

926
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Can actually beat this it's a pretty large pal

927
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
So you know, we're just gonna we're just

928
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Can I do this

929
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Oh

930
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Alright guys got to say

931
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
that

932
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
This is really really really cool

933
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
This is great um, so this is uh being able to do something like this people can just do whatever the hell they want

934
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
to the detriment of your

935
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
We're doing four zip-gun

936
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
We're gonna do here's what we're gonna do

937
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
We're gonna do four zip-guns

938
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
With as much ammo as I can put in them all

939
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
What about chain-dons? Let's try that

940
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I'm just curious to see how much more outrageous the chain guns are with four of them

941
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I

942
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I

943
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Yeah, that one's too dangerous because I can't even move so we're not doing that we're doing zip-guns

944
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Four zip guns and four heels. What's knock?

945
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So this is could you kind of blocks projectiles?

946
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Oh

947
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I wasn't even firing the fourth one was I

948
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Let's just do it who cares let's do fucking five chain guns

949
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Look at how much money this is I'm not even gonna build a fort

950
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
How much money do I have

951
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Total bang okay, I'm out of money

952
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Let's go you guys ready to lose the game I'm about ready to lose the game

953
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I'm out of money game over I have to win the search game over and I have four I can't even control the character with W a.c

954
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I'm just gonna there's no way I can't do that at w a.c

955
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
F I have my my hand on my mouse too

956
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
But you know with that with a little luck we could just spare myself to victory

957
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
We'll take it easy at first there's new hazards, okay

958
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Okay

959
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Oh

960
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Why is this working why is this working

961
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
It's like super no brain

962
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
That's gonna take over this whole place ain't it

963
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Oh

964
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I have so sweet color

965
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
This is gonna reflect the

966
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Let's get the brain give me the brain

967
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Where's the brain was brain quick?

968
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Try this

969
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Dead

970
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Well, hell is the brain

971
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
It's all the way over here that that's

972
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I died

973
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I died I blew up

974
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
If I were to wait if I went the right way it would have worked

975
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I'm okay with just losing all my money in the game being over let's see what happens

976
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Oh, this guy gonna kill me

977
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Okay, it's fun being bankrupt I guess

978
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Out of funs game over total score

979
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Revenue that's so cool it gives you like a graph look at the kills near the end

980
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
You show that bank account statement like that to a guy in Wall Street will probably throw up

981
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:02,000
That's there it is that's the game cryptark

982
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
We give you a million dollars and you spent it all on chaingums

983
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Why did we hire you in the first place you're a fucking idiot

984
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,000
All right, well, I'm gonna do another run this time I'm gonna this this this one will be a little bit more legit

985
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Because the first couple times that no idea what the hell I was doing and then the last few were more kind of joking around and messing around with the loadouts

986
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
But this is cryptark

987
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,000
From what I just played this like 40 minutes session so far this is really really really cool

988
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Highly recommended so far, so I'm gonna pee I

989
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Will back in like two minutes

990
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
The first of many pisses by the way

991
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Like if you didn't think there was gonna be at least like four pisses this stream I just really don't know what's tight

992
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Be right back I'm gonna go pee

993
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
You

994
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
You

995
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
You

996
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
You

997
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Hello

998
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
So what am I gonna do game where can I just continue?

999
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Now that's from the previous one

1000
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
New game right

1001
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Yeah, wait one yeah, okay, so you game

1002
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
slot two hey, you know, we should look at this tutorial

1003
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Check list cleared pines bitch on weapons free. I'll get the angle grinder up when you get back

1004
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,000
To it's a leg right off the bat. I guess this is giving it look off. You know, we're gonna go to

1005
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
This one seems pretty good

1006
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Let's actually try to beat this

1007
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I like the way the character looks we've got his face

1008
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Looks like a shark that like shark red shark face

1009
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
It's pretty damn cool

1010
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Let's conserve money

1011
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
We'll go with the ramp spike

1012
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Don't need two of these at the first level might not even need one. I don't need the grenades

1013
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
You do two shields no

1014
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Save money in the first few levels for sure

1015
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I

1016
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Think that's pretty bear bones. That's fine. This shouldn't be that difficult

1017
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
You know save even more money. I'm doing pick that down. I think this not too

1018
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I'm seeing a repair system on board this vessel is

1019
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Scrolls will attempt to fix other systems. We have already destroyed

1020
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
There's a repair that goes down first

1021
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Yeah, that that has to go down first because the alarm system and the shield generator will both be repaired

1022
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
By the time I try to come back down. So we have to go I guess kind of just right in the front

1023
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
This is not really this is a terrible entry point

1024
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Along do I have five minutes I

1025
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Hold on I've five minutes to go from here all the way down here all the way up and then all the way down again

1026
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Might just bypass the alarm come over here and get rid of the arm ring system. Oh, this is a this is a really tough

1027
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Generated level

1028
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:02,000
You can come down here and I still have to go up

1029
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
You know what we'll go. Yeah, we'll go there

1030
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Let's go

1031
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
54,000 dollars. That's nothing. That's peanuts

1032
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Oh

1033
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I know I know I know knock out the arm ring system. Where am I going? Where am I?

1034
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Fuck

1035
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I

1036
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Thought it was like down to the left. It's right above me. I just lost like a full their 20 seconds

1037
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
This isn't even the right area to go in. No, I guess it is I'm going the way

1038
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I

1039
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Stinger pod cool

1040
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Brain

1041
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I

1042
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Second man's heavy machine gun burst I

1043
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Didn't even see what the hell does hit me

1044
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
What the fuck just hit me is like these bomb things that are floating around

1045
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
You

1046
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Walk in my view

1047
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
All right now we're gonna go

1048
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Destroyed the shield

1049
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Here

1050
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Back upgrade got free minutes like a time

1051
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I gotta go down because I can't go through it's yeah down around

1052
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
You

1053
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
That

1054
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Never seen this enemy yet this thing takes a ton of hits

1055
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
That

1056
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
It was actually pretty hard for some reason

1057
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Open up

1058
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Open your face please

1059
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
That another shield up here

1060
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
These and I hate these

1061
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Expending wheel of death enemy to the world

1062
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
You

1063
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Out of here I want any of this

1064
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
These guys sneak up on you they blend in with the environment pretty well

1065
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Brain

1066
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Brain

1067
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Not sure

1068
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Shield isn't

1069
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Yeah, that's just the alarm system I can't hurt it

1070
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Huh

1071
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
What's going on here

1072
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Does that protect this as well I thought that was just an alarm

1073
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Guess not well already then

1074
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I

1075
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Can't go around this either this is a

1076
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,000
You're trying to look yeah, I can't hit the glowing side I guess okay

1077
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Yeah, there was no way to go around

1078
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Was that just like locked in there that was that that side was locked in

1079
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Unless I like went through that was weird

1080
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Yeah, I don't think there was any there was no way for me to go to the other side of that brain I

1081
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Think I think I may have just gotten procedurally generated screwed

1082
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Because if I went if I had to go all the way around I don't hit like 30 seconds

1083
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Damn it

1084
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Okay

1085
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
You'd have to go around the whole ship I only had like 45 seconds

1086
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Whatever

1087
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I could I could be I could be upset or I can you know just get get myself going do it again

1088
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Well, I'm not happy that I just blew that money I

1089
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Don't like this bike

1090
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
That one seems kind of cool, but let's look at the

1091
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Cluster grenades stinger to pod

1092
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,000
No, I want to bet here. I don't think I need that money

1093
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Try these for fun stinger misses not that many

1094
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
This is new

1095
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
That seems pretty damn cool you can teleport to it

1096
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I like that I kind of want to try it

1097
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Take a look

1098
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
So there are two places to go to the brain

1099
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Shield

1100
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
If I go in this way I can destroy the shield here

1101
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I don't think there's a reason to destroy the door lock

1102
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Don't really need to care about the alarm here just bang around here

1103
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
There is a repair station there

1104
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
And I come up get rid of that

1105
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:02,000
If I can destroy this and then come around quickly enough to destroy this

1106
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It's risky, but I'm thinking might try it

1107
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I'm gonna try that I should be able to go from here to there in less than a couple like a minute or two right

1108
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Worst comes to worse that is have to go back around

1109
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I'm gonna go straight down to the top

1110
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Let's go

1111
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
So I got to go from here. I got that's actually pretty long way to go

1112
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I'm gonna go all the way around the ship

1113
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Move

1114
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Yeah

1115
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Yeah, the teleport it can go down I'm gonna put the teleporter right up here

1116
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Is it sad?

1117
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Oh god

1118
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Okay, so you just hit two and then you hit two again

1119
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
What the fuck?

1120
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Well back to the original plan oh

1121
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
My god, what a fucking disaster this one is

1122
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:26,000
This one is a total fucking disaster because I was too busy figuring out how the teleporter worked

1123
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I thought it was gonna like shoot out of the device

1124
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,000
No, I guess it's just like remembers where you are at the time

1125
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
What the fuck

1126
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I can do this in time for sure

1127
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Just a little bit there was slow

1128
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Oh

1129
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
16,000

1130
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Wish I had the teleport now

1131
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Really wish I had the teleport

1132
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Yeah

1133
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Run in ammo

1134
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Yeah, right on that

1135
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Running out of ammo

1136
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
I got oh that could have been a lot later

1137
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I'm so upset right now

1138
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I

1139
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Wanted how much money I'm not going to get for getting actually

1140
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I took the the help which I absolutely needed to do otherwise I would have lost

1141
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Load out max 100k

1142
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Does that mean that I

1143
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Spent more than a hundred thousand dollars to be able to do that mission

1144
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Apparently

1145
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Is there a story in this game? I think it's pretty open ended. You're like a crew

1146
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:01,000
That's doing these like salvaging mr. Salva-ging missions for this weird snake person company

1147
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I don't know like all the lore. I don't think there's very much. I mean this is a member this is a this game is early access

1148
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Just remember that that's kind of this is a very very

1149
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Complete feeling game for it being early access

1150
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Okay

1151
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Do I just play I might just play it say if you're into one of the ones I

1152
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Need to do something simple to not because that first one really does got screwed. I'll do the two

1153
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Tech advances six one tail station that's just two I want to try to get to the end

1154
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:47,000
One is too easy two is like okay three is like a little bit more difficult

1155
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Small to that's good

1156
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Larm down there

1157
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
No supply pods in the lowdown needs to be more than 60k I

1158
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Could probably get all three

1159
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I'm gonna go for all three bonuses, which shouldn't be that hard

1160
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Considering I can just walk right in the store two tech pods

1161
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
There's the shield going with the key destroy the brain

1162
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Pretty self-explanatory Terry

1163
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:32,000
So bang bang is a key right. Oh, yeah, this is this is this is Kate as you spend 60 grand

1164
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
How much is the loadout worth right now 79

1165
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Get rid of these that wasn't a fan of those

1166
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Hmm, I don't need this

1167
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
60k right okay, I think that's good to go

1168
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Oh the max okay, I get I get it I get it

1169
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
So I'm just gonna go with nothing at all

1170
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Maybe a little bit more ammo with the zip gun that'll do it

1171
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
That'll do it

1172
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
All right guys, let's do it right in the front door should be easy

1173
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
To check out variants right off the bat

1174
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I need to have six oh

1175
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
That I thought that was an enemy

1176
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I'm gonna watch out for the alarm

1177
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I thought it's gonna be hard to shoot through here

1178
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I need to get close

1179
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
These are the worst ones I hate those ones

1180
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Oh

1181
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Come off whoa that was black

1182
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Oh my god my game is lagging

1183
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Okay, well that didn't really go to swim

1184
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Oh

1185
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
The shield we're charging shield we're charging together. Thank God

1186
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Bye-bye I didn't I didn't get the first bonus, but whatever

1187
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,000
When in doubt blame lag well the lag's not the right word like

1188
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Hardware lag like in everything like you know your computer freezes for like a second

1189
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Not like internet lag

1190
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Grades don't reflect like bullets the shield killer is basically oh okay, that's good to know

1191
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I just wish I could rebind the button to be something of my mouth

1192
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Got least the two

1193
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
bonuses I got plenty of money now

1194
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:14,000
My reki probes are showing several new types of defensive systems and morphons aboard the target vessels

1195
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Compiling this new information to the taknav now even more stuff to worry about great

1196
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Two fives or two threes this one is the more expensive three

1197
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Do that

1198
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I have a lot of money

1199
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I'm going to get a little bit more health because I have more money I

1200
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Know that load up max 60k is a thing, but I would like to complete this game at least you know do a run of this game

1201
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I guess

1202
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Drown factories how many drone factories are there?

1203
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Okay, this except oh, what's this one EMP shotgun?

1204
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Oh

1205
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Let's try that

1206
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I'll get him it's just hard to use I just hitting F is awkward for me

1207
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:40,000
We got a hedge I said EMP weaponry this game will scramble us credit's good

1208
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Good enough

1209
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
F I want that to be mouse for

1210
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Now should still be most for mouse for

1211
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Damn it

1212
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
That's too bad it's not F now it's not

1213
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Well

1214
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Can you make it most now I can't do most five

1215
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Something that's less

1216
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Hmm F is really the only thing I guess it's I guess

1217
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Shift maybe shift yeah actually shift is probably better

1218
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Then that takes away that I'll do this as alt maybe

1219
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
See if that's better

1220
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Yeah, it's better not ideal, but

1221
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
So this is an EMP shotgun which disables electronics

1222
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,000
So assuming I can go bang they shut down for a second like you can destroy it

1223
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
All right, let's take a look at the area

1224
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Tons of these repair systems

1225
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Too many of them might with some one might say

1226
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I

1227
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Think I'm gonna get rid of the alarm system this time I'm gonna start with the alarm system

1228
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I'm going right in here and destroy the alarm system that really does just kill you every time

1229
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:51,000
When you trip that every you're gonna lose like 4 HP from the sheer amount of people that are running around

1230
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
I

1231
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Mean this you can do twin stick. I mean you're talking about mouse control you twins

1232
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I believe you can plug it. There's a gamepad mode. It probably works. Okay. It's like kind of like geometry wars

1233
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Unlike the Xbox

1234
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Course of action in here. No, I can't do that because the prepare stations

1235
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Well, these are the only two repair stations

1236
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
One two get rid of those

1237
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Okay, here's the plan I'm gonna get rid of both of these through here. I'm gonna bring a key with me

1238
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,000
And then I'm gonna go down here. I'm gonna place the teleporter right there

1239
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Okay

1240
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Teleporter goes there

1241
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Then we go over here take out the alarm

1242
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Teleport take out the shield and then make our way up in a round actually yeah up and around to the core

1243
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Okay, so that means I need a couple things I need a key and I need a teleport

1244
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Okay

1245
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:22,000
And I start here which means I have to go up around this way through here. Let's give it a go

1246
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
On which ameldo I have enough

1247
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
That was a lot of money

1248
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Yeah, I personally wouldn't be able to play this game on anything but a mouse

1249
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Although like a twin stick shooters usually they're pretty they're okay. They're not terrible

1250
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Because it's just like you're right thumb to do the same thing right

1251
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Those in the spin guys

1252
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
You

1253
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:36,000
of

1254
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Oh, those things can't hurt.

1255
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I just realized that.

1256
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Those cannot hurt you.

1257
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I guess they can.

1258
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Oh god.

1259
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Just being repaired by the other one, isn't it?

1260
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Oh, so much ammo.

1261
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,000
He's been lost.

1262
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I know. Gotta go. Gotta go.

1263
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Okay, they're both dead.

1264
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Let's go back around.

1265
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Who?

1266
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Fun.

1267
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:46,000
What the fuck?

1268
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I need a- I need- I'm gonna need up an ammo station here.

1269
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:56,000
For sure.

1270
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Gotta keep it right.

1271
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,000
I'm gonna need going at them.

1272
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
All right, let's put down.

1273
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:16,000
There's the teleporter.

1274
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Well, I have a second here.

1275
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Looking for an ammo station.

1276
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Down here.

1277
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Okay.

1278
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Where am I right now?

1279
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
That's far.

1280
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Ugh.

1281
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Going to the right is too far to go.

1282
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
I'm gonna have to just do it.

1283
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I'm gonna have to just bite the bullet and go down.

1284
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
To the left and down.

1285
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I need to take out that one down there.

1286
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Okay, let's go.

1287
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I don't have to attack anybody.

1288
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I won't.

1289
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Fucking hate those enemies.

1290
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:07,000
These guys have put up the shield.

1291
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,000
The thing is that repaired you.

1292
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Holy dog shit.

1293
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
There's so many things flying around.

1294
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Ugh.

1295
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
What the?

1296
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Quick left for dead.

1297
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Come on.

1298
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Come on left for dead.

1299
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:37,000
I'm gonna have to go back to the right.

1300
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
What the?

1301
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Quick left for dead.

1302
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Come on.

1303
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Left for dead.

1304
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Bring me back.

1305
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Bring me back.

1306
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Come back.

1307
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

1308
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Yes, I will.

1309
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
That was a lot of money.

1310
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:06,000
That was a huge amount of money.

1311
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:12,000
That on the time for this.

1312
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I'm blowing through so much money.

1313
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:26,000
It's crazy.

1314
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,000
What?

1315
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
You fucker.

1316
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
That's that's game over.

1317
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,000
We're gonna go teleport.

1318
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
See you later.

1319
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I triggered the alarm, but guess what?

1320
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
It didn't even matter.

1321
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:45,000
What the hell is shooting me from across the map?

1322
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Should've got grenades.

1323
01:47:47,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Should've got grenades.

1324
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I'm gonna have to go back to the map.

1325
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,000
That's not the right way.

1326
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
60 seconds.

1327
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
60 seconds.

1328
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Franchise fingers.

1329
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Oh, I don't think so.

1330
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,000
I don't think it's gonna add...

1331
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:37,000
It's gonna be a fucking Christmas miracle if I can do this.

1332
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Jesus!

1333
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
No way.

1334
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
No way.

1335
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Game over.

1336
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
I can't.

1337
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
I'm not gonna left for dead my way out of this one.

1338
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
No way.

1339
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Holy shit.

1340
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Fuck.

1341
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:13,000
The EMP was the shotgun that I had.

1342
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Fuck.

1343
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
It's okay.

1344
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
I still got money.

1345
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I still got cash.

1346
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Oh my god.

1347
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
It's because I bounded to shift.

1348
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
That was...

1349
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Oh my god.

1350
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
You see, if I could just put my fucking keybinding on the thing I wanted,

1351
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I wouldn't have forgotten that I had bombs because I pressed F.

1352
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
And I was like, I don't have bombs.

1353
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Of course I don't.

1354
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
No, it's because I had it on...

1355
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Fuckin' shit!

1356
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:57,000
It should be on this button.

1357
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
I don't think it would have mattered though, honestly.

1358
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I'm pretty sure I still was gonna lose that.

1359
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Fuck.

1360
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I'm gonna crack this shit.

1361
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Oh, spam.

1362
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Spam the salty, but this streamer's getting fucking salty.

1363
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Now, I just didn't think I had them for some reason because I just rebounded the key.

1364
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,000
And I like forgot that the key was bound there.

1365
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
That was the problem.

1366
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Won't forget this time.

1367
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I love a god.

1368
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I actually don't like this shotgun either.

1369
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:13,000
What is this?

1370
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Now they're licensing us industrial equipment and standard weapons.

1371
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Comotive, ungrin projector.

1372
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Some sort of cool gun for disarboned scrap metal.

1373
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,000
What does it do?

1374
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:36,000
I don't know what it does.

1375
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:43,000
You can also cook the grenades too.

1376
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:49,000
We'll get as good as we're gonna have to find out.

1377
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Slime mortar cannons.

1378
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Let's slow them down.

1379
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Let's go looking.

1380
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I think it's time to buy more ammo for the Zip Gun.

1381
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Another expensive trip.

1382
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Not gonna not factory.

1383
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Okay.

1384
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Drawing factory.

1385
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,000
It's another one of these spread out ones.

1386
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:47,000
The brain is here.

1387
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
The brain is making me dehydrated.

1388
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Go drink some water.

1389
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Go drink a gatorade.

1390
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I don't know about this one.

1391
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:13,000
This one's really spread out.

1392
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Technically I can just go in there.

1393
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Even if the alarm does sound, let's say I just go in here.

1394
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
And come right back in here.

1395
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Even if the alarm sounds where they're gonna come from.

1396
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:33,000
They're gonna have to come a long way.

1397
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
That's a very far way to go.

1398
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I'm gonna try that.

1399
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I got my Goo Gun.

1400
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I can try that.

1401
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
We'll do it.

1402
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
So where's the ship?

1403
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,000
And in there.

1404
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
I'm gonna also put a... yeah!

1405
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Let's do this.

1406
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I'm going here first.

1407
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I'm gonna...

1408
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
That's probably a bad idea.

1409
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:05,000
I'm gonna say put a teleporter in here, but I'm gonna trip the alarm and that'll screw me.

1410
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
I'm gonna get rid of the teleporter.

1411
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,000
I don't want to use it.

1412
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Whoa!

1413
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Can you guys hear that?

1414
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Holy shit!

1415
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Hold on.

1416
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Wow!

1417
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Those are coyotes.

1418
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:40,000
What the fuck is going on out here?

1419
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I don't know if you guys could hear that.

1420
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Those are coyotes, man.

1421
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Just looking out the window, trying to see.

1422
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
My dog just jumped up.

1423
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:05,000
He's like, what the hell is out there?

1424
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
That was right.

1425
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I've heard them before.

1426
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
I've heard coyotes before.

1427
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Down here, but...

1428
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Oh, that was right outside my window.

1429
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Alright!

1430
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Well, you guys can hear the coyotes.

1431
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:27,000
That's cool.

1432
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Well, if those are coyotes, I don't know what they would be considering there's no dogs over there.

1433
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
That is woods.

1434
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Alright, we'll back to reality here.

1435
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Alright, let's go.

1436
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I'm gonna stick with the plan.

1437
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,000
So expensive.

1438
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:03,000
The plan is go all the way up and just go and just shoot the go everywhere.

1439
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Such a stupid plan.

1440
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,000
What an awful idea.

1441
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I wish I was better at playing difficult video games.

1442
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Because I could have planned that out.

1443
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
I'm just gonna go here.

1444
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Chalapura is gonna go over there.

1445
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:28,000
That's not a place to go.

1446
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,000
What's the good thing?

1447
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:43,000
I'm totally sure.

1448
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Flame thrower.

1449
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Now that's what I want to see.

1450
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Get out of here.

1451
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Worst enemy in game.

1452
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Health that I'll meet at the moment.

1453
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Wait a second.

1454
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Oh shit in my pants.

1455
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Come on now.

1456
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Wonderful.

1457
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
I don't want to use grenades.

1458
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
What a dumb mistake that was.

1459
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Is there a unbelievable?

1460
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Oh come.

1461
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Oh come.

1462
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Go go go go go go go go go go go go.

1463
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Go.

1464
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Guys just make swimming out here.

1465
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
How far away is it right there?

1466
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Straight up.

1467
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Take the heal.

1468
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:24,000
I was blow this thing to health.

1469
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Oh that lag.

1470
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Very quick.

1471
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Very quick indeed.

1472
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:44,000
My apprentices.

1473
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Look at that bonus.

1474
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Look at that bonus for beating that in that amount of time.

1475
01:58:54,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I think we made back a couple of our awful mistakes that I made.

1476
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I would say so.

1477
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
This is where I lost last time.

1478
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:13,000
So for the purposes of me trying not to lose again.

1479
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Last time I did a six and did all chain guns.

1480
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,000
This time we're going to stay with the baby three.

1481
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
So I can try to get to the end of this game.

1482
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:29,000
And I might not even get to the end of the game.

1483
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:45,000
That's two expensive.

1484
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I think we do like a melee only build.

1485
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
That's pretty awesome.

1486
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Where's the flamethrower?

1487
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Flamethrower.

1488
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Simple but undeniably potent in tight spaces.

1489
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:09,000
This brutish weapon sprays pressurized gouts of highly flammable liquid.

1490
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:14,000
We're going to need a lot more than that.

1491
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
I would say we're going to need like that.

1492
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
And you know I'm going to stay trumble.

1493
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,000
No.

1494
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:27,000
I'm just lying moderate.

1495
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,000
You know, I'm not really wasn't really feeling it.

1496
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
So we're going to have a backup here.

1497
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Back up.

1498
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:38,000
This is the upgun.

1499
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Maximum 100,000.

1500
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
What am I at right now?

1501
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,000
That's way more than 100,000.

1502
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:49,000
It's double 100,000 in fact.

1503
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Alright, we got our 200,000 dollar loadout just in case the flamethrower sucks.

1504
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:01,000
We're going to try it.

1505
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Flamethrower always seemed to be amazing or terrible.

1506
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
That's very true.

1507
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Let's hope it is the former.

1508
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Let's take a look.

1509
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,000
That's not really even a flamethrower, man.

1510
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:20,000
I guess it is.

1511
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:25,000
That's very, very dangerous.

1512
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
One problem I see with this weapon.

1513
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
It's very blinding.

1514
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:34,000
It's going to be hard for me to see incoming projectiles.

1515
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:43,000
But we'll give it a go.

1516
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Another two repair.

1517
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
This one sucks.

1518
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Again, we can go for speed.

1519
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Two repairs.

1520
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Wrap around right to the shield.

1521
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
There's a couple of tech on the way.

1522
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
How is this core surrounding?

1523
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Let me see this core.

1524
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:08,000
There's one tiny little slot to get into this core room.

1525
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,000
That's it.

1526
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:15,000
It's right in the corner here.

1527
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:18,000
That's a really awkward spot.

1528
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:25,000
I don't know if it will find out.

1529
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Maybe it can reflect it.

1530
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
We'll see.

1531
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Up here.

1532
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:40,000
And then if I go down through here in there.

1533
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
I actually might have enough time to take the alarm out.

1534
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:48,000
And save myself a little bit of potential embarrassment.

1535
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
We're using the flamethrower.

1536
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I've never used it before.

1537
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Probably a bad idea, but it's too late.

1538
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
I just dropped $200,000.

1539
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Let's go ahead and go right.

1540
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I have the key.

1541
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
For this purpose, let's go right in.

1542
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
No, I don't have the key.

1543
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I don't have the key.

1544
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
I'd say I'm going to go down.

1545
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Let's go down this way.

1546
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
All right.

1547
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Boys and girls.

1548
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Flamethrower time.

1549
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Let's turn on flames.

1550
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I knew it was going to blind me, but it's very, very powerful.

1551
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
In fact, it's so powerful.

1552
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:44,000
It's still making the noise like I'm shooting it when I'm not.

1553
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Oh, what is hitting the fuck here?

1554
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,000
God.

1555
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
I don't like it.

1556
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,000
I don't like it.

1557
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:06,000
It's too hard to see.

1558
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Oh, boy.

1559
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
That's a guy.

1560
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,000
This is still building.

1561
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Oh, boy.

1562
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Oh, boy.

1563
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Oh, boy.

1564
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Oh, boy.

1565
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Oh, I kind of can't reflect.

1566
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Yes, it can.

1567
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Oh, I can't.

1568
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:59,000
I can absolutely reflect it.

1569
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Laser.

1570
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
I like the sound of that.

1571
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,000
All right.

1572
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Come on.

1573
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Right when I hit tab.

1574
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
I wish I got plenty of time.

1575
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Let's just take a slow.

1576
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Hey, get slow.

1577
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:28,000
I got a full six.

1578
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Oh, my God.

1579
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Surrounded down.

1580
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:56,000
What the fuck did you come from?

1581
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:14,000
I'm not going to be so hot.

1582
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Oh, my Lord.

1583
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Those things do so much damage.

1584
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:22,000
They're so hard to kill.

1585
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Surprise.

1586
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I didn't get my life back.

1587
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
All right.

1588
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,000
We need to see.

1589
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Okay, straight up.

1590
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Straight up.

1591
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Literally straight up.

1592
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,000
See you later.

1593
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1594
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I'll go that way.

1595
02:06:51,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Let's do this right.

1596
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Let's do it right.

1597
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Oh, come on.

1598
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Come on.

1599
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Really?

1600
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:29,000
No way.

1601
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Fuck.

1602
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
This ain't happening.

1603
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Damn.

1604
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
I just didn't like it a life here.

1605
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
There's so many enemies here.

1606
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,000
It's a left or dead.

1607
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Yeah, I got it, but I immediately died.

1608
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Oh, God.

1609
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Yeah, Flamethrower.

1610
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:56,000
I think Flamethrower kind of stuck a fork in that one, unfortunately.

1611
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
And I had a money.

1612
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:03,000
And now I still have a little bit of money.

1613
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Flamethrower too short and blinds you, unfortunately.

1614
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:21,000
I tried this one.

1615
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,000
This game seems tough.

1616
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:30,000
It is very tough.

1617
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
But it's very fun.

1618
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
It's very fun.

1619
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:39,000
I got to try to salvage as much money as I can.

1620
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Well, and by salvage money, I mean the game is the game crashed.

1621
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,000
No, what?

1622
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Yeah, I don't know how this still audio playing.

1623
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
I'm not sure how this still audio playing.

1624
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Yeah, the game crashed.

1625
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:10,000
That's too bad.

1626
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
So where is it?

1627
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:19,000
It's not on my taskbar.

1628
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Sounds like it's on the menu screen.

1629
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Oh.

1630
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:34,000
It's still running.

1631
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:41,000
But where is that running?

1632
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Well, there's that.

1633
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Well, we can just start it again.

1634
02:09:51,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Hold on a second.

1635
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I probably could salvage that too.

1636
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Unfortunately.

1637
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,000
I'll try. I'll give it one more go.

1638
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
I'm going to give it one more.

1639
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Start to finish.

1640
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Try to run through it.

1641
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I may or may not get to the last couple of places.

1642
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:23,000
This is a very, very hard game.

1643
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
But that's good.

1644
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,000
That's like a good thing.

1645
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Can I continue?

1646
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Wait for.

1647
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
I think so, alright.

1648
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Yeah, this is the same.

1649
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
No, okay, we can keep going.

1650
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:42,000
I guess it just crashed out and saved them.

1651
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:52,000
There was a tutorial.

1652
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
It was a pretty short one.

1653
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,000
This is a very dark level.

1654
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:01,000
I might have to rethink my entire strategy.

1655
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Going quick and trying to blow through.

1656
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:09,000
I just get so scared of the time.

1657
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:13,000
But I can't afford anything.

1658
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:21,000
I have $133,000.

1659
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Highly recommend this though, guys.

1660
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Honestly, this is one of the more fun games in this category

1661
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:32,000
that I've played since like Binding Vizek.

1662
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:35,000
There's a lot of different loadout options.

1663
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:42,000
There's a lot of very, very difficult things in the game.

1664
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:47,000
But I don't understand what this is.

1665
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Does that mean it cuts through doors?

1666
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
I don't know what that means.

1667
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,000
See, the problem with playing through one of these games for the first time

1668
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
and trying to figure out that last run

1669
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
by using a flamethrower?

1670
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
I blew $100,000 and lost the mission.

1671
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,000
I had to figure out that I didn't like it.

1672
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
But that's why it's cool.

1673
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Because you're going to play with all these items

1674
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
and all these things,

1675
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
and you're going to lose a shitload of times.

1676
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:18,000
And you'll find the thing that you like.

1677
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
And you'll do all your runs like that.

1678
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Oh no, what's the matter?

1679
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
What are you doing?

1680
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,000
What are you doing?

1681
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,000
True dead bone.

1682
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Just looking at me and just making like a...

1683
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Saw.

1684
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
I just saw a saw.

1685
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Why do I feel like I'm going to make like a star comment?

1686
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Like the relatable gamer star?

1687
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,000
I feel like if star played this game, he would just do all melee.

1688
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
And he would beat the game in like 20 minutes

1689
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
and be like, oh no, I didn't all melee run.

1690
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
He'd show me.

1691
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,000
And I'd be like, cool, whatever, dude.

1692
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Why does like melee...

1693
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:02,000
I feel like melee guy is something that like star would do.

1694
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,000
If you're watching right now star.

1695
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Do it.

1696
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Let's see it, you know?

1697
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Let's see it.

1698
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,000
I don't know, maybe I think I'm going to change up my whole...

1699
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,000
my whole scheme here.

1700
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
I can't do that.

1701
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I don't have enough money.

1702
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Well, I'm absolutely not going to beat this one

1703
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
because I have like no money.

1704
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
132?

1705
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Are the key?

1706
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
I'm... I'm...

1707
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
I want to do the double spread shotgun.

1708
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Okay, let's try it.

1709
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Alright, I got nothing to lose really at this point.

1710
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Let's just see how that works.

1711
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
That's a lot of recoil.

1712
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I'm like flying too far back.

1713
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
I think that's going to screw with me.

1714
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
To do the double spread.

1715
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Dangerous though.

1716
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:36,000
I can spread him out.

1717
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:39,000
I don't have to do it at the same time.

1718
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:42,000
And that's probably not enough ammo.

1719
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
How do you weigh more ammo than that?

1720
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Yeah, that's not going to work.

1721
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Oh.

1722
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Short wave scanners are getting interference.

1723
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:54,000
It looks like there's an active jammersystem in this hole.

1724
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Great.

1725
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Now I'm definitely going to lose.

1726
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:00,000
I'm going to give you a laser gintel on the rest of the ship.

1727
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Though I'm absolutely losing this one.

1728
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,000
You guys want to see the end of this run?

1729
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
It's going to happen right now.

1730
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,000
You know what's even in there?

1731
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,000
What is even in here?

1732
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Shield.

1733
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Jammer.

1734
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Cool, cool-aid jammer.

1735
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Let's go.

1736
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Get this shit, go.

1737
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Where's the shield up there?

1738
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Go.

1739
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,000
There you go.

1740
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:52,000
I don't even care.

1741
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Okay.

1742
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,000
I can give a shit.

1743
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Let's go.

1744
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:24,000
I can't fit down the little bot crack.

1745
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,000
What the hell?

1746
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:42,000
What the hell?

1747
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
What the way?

1748
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,000
No way.

1749
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
That was dog shit.

1750
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:51,000
I got stuck in the corner over there.

1751
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Oh my god.

1752
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:09,000
I can't go.

1753
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Let's do it.

1754
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Where's the core?

1755
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Right down here.

1756
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:24,000
We got technology.

1757
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,000
I ain't even messing around right now.

1758
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
I'm here for one purpose.

1759
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Where the brain?

1760
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Oh, get up.

1761
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Just die.

1762
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Huh?

1763
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I'm just gonna lock me out.

1764
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,000
This guy's like locking me out.

1765
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Get out of the way.

1766
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Start praying.

1767
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Look, blow it up, blow it up, do it!

1768
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:35,000
What did the explosion, did the explosion kill me?

1769
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:42,000
What's going on?

1770
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,000
It's a banana wave, skilled you.

1771
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:52,000
All right, time for a fucking dog camp.

1772
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:57,000
I'm just gonna lock you out.

1773
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:04,000
You know what?

1774
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Time for a fucking dog camp.

1775
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:18,000
When life's got you down, then you're getting your ass kicked in a video game.

1776
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:25,000
It's just time for a fucking dog camp.

1777
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:32,000
He's locking his ass.

1778
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Hey, hey, hey, you're on dog camp.

1779
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Don't you know that, buddy?

1780
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Hey, auto.

1781
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Got you.

1782
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:00,000
You're on candid dog camp.

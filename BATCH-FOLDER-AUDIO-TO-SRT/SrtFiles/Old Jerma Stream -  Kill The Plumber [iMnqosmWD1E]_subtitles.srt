1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Who cares?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You know what I mean?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Gipsy shit.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I was working on a video.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I wanted to take a quick little break.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Maybe stream for an hour or two.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Go back to it.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So what is going to play?

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So this game is a little different.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You are the bad guy in this game.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You have to kill the not Super Mario as a gumball.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I have a certain amount of time.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sometimes you just have to say who cares turn on the stream.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I just screwed it up.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I have to restart.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What is the quick restart?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Right bumper?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That is good enough.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It is a neat little game.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It gets much harder.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is just the first little area.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It is cold.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It is really cold.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It is extremely cold.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It is going to get really cold tonight too.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I think it is going to be like 10 degrees or something around here.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Later on.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, he got it.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How do I get three stars here?

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I feel like that is going to be hard to do.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Because I have to, if you are wondering what is going on on the bottom of the screen here,

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I have to start an amount of time to get three stars.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How am I supposed to get him to die before the first star is taken away?

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I am not going for perfect, but going for completion.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I am going to make him jump this way.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I can do that over here.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, you are playing as the goombas.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You play as the bad guys in this game.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Fuck.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How am I supposed to get up there?

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't jump right now.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Is there something I am missing?

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That is one star.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Don't ask me.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Damn it.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This game makes me mess myself.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I just didn't even mean to do that, but I got two stars.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I got three stars.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I am going to kill the plumber.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I am going to kill the plumber.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Free to play.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is it really?

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I got it on steam.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
One star is better than three stars.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I screwed it up already.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can definitely get him here.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, come on.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I know I can get him here.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I am positive.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I am 100% positive.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He is not jumping on my head either.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I am going to call shenanigans.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I am going to get this.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This does remind me of an old mini clip game.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Last time I was able to watch a stream, I was off sick from work.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I just know.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You are going to be quick in this game.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If he gets to that pole, it is over.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Damn it.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There we go.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Seems like it is a lot like super house of dead ninjas where the steam version has some extra levels.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I saw, hey, this is cool.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I have to be the stop guy.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
See, that first little area was this.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Come on, walk through.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Gotcha.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can't get away from the stop.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I am already beaten this one.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I have to be way faster than that.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No, there is no snow at here yet.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I am still snowless at the moment.

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That wasn't right.

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Still three stars.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, Inky, I hope you had a good new year as well in holiday.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I can turn to a hammer brother now.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's redo this one.

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Very slow.

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He is standing completely still.

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I am just trying to get like the three stars.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I have to suck it up.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have something cool for Christmas.

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I have a safety razor for Christmas.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I have a cold fashion, your grandfather 1930s shave razor.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I think it is wonderful.

96
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I am going to do this shoe at three.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's see, one, two, three.

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And then he is a movie.

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I just have to jump over these and throw that.

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I am going to throw it again.

101
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That will let him go over.

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Right at the bush.

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Swinny Todd.

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
There we go.

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Red Ranger just subscribed to the channel.

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Welcome.

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I didn't realize that one was going there.

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I just put that one in.

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
My first and only emote ever.

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It is currently processing through Twitch right now.

111
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It is fucking terrible.

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I am not paying attention.

113
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Big one little one.

114
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I got him.

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The moment of the coaster.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
First beta explode.

117
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I like this one.

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Can I jump too?

119
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hey, whoa, whoa, he shoots.

120
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What?

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
How am I supposed to get him?

122
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can go underneath it.

123
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I am going to hold left.

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Three stars, right?

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I will tell you, I will be honest with you.

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't know what my emotes are going to be.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I have no idea.

129
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This emote is just such an awful, it is just the fucking moon.

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You will see it a little bit.

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The timer doesn't start to move.

132
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I get it.

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Look at this guy in the chat.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Ghostly hell.

135
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You are correct.

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Now I am controlling two people at the same time.

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This is going to be odd for me.

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't know if he can kill that one.

139
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Can I jump out of this?

140
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't think I can even jump out of this.

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I knocked him up.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I just can't wait till you guys.

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Whoever is subscribed to this channel.

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
When stars streaming, you can spam the fuck out of his chat with the German moon emote.

145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That is all I care about.

146
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is just like a big boo.

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I get it.

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What just killed him?

149
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He just jumped me.

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I thought he couldn't see me.

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is not sponsored.

152
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Can I jump through here?

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I think I can.

154
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Can I close that off?

155
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Kind of confused here.

156
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is definitely where I can get him to go through that hole.

157
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

158
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's think about this for a second.

159
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
When that's closed, he's looking over here.

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Open it so I can go down.

161
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No!

162
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm just going to have to catch him over here when he comes down here.

163
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah.

164
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
How long till we get moon butt?

165
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The moon butt.

166
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Tremor, why didn't you show up at our wedding?

167
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't know, man.

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Make him collect all the green coins to disable his powers.

169
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
How the hell am I going to get him to do that?

170
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He's going to kill me right here.

171
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Will he just want, and he's going to walk into all of them except for...

172
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He's showing me this is a new mechanic in the game.

173
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He's going to get them all.

174
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I didn't even have to do anything.

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I think they're just teaching me this.

176
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Huh?

177
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Okay, okay. I still had to kill him.

178
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I let him get all the coins that I didn't do anything about it.

179
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
See, oh, this is going to be...

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay, I'm going to have to give him a second here, guys.

181
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
No.

182
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You know, I think I can hide in here, right?

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Just wait till he's done and just follow him down.

184
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Kind of.

185
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Maybe?

186
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No, I don't think so.

187
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah, actually, that was right.

188
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Because I'm going to appear right here and he's going to walk right into me.

189
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Fuck the other coin!

190
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
There we go.

191
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't even care if I got no...

192
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Only two stars on this one.

193
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He tried to jump me.

194
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I just barely beat that one.

195
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Took me a really long time to realize that you're the ghost of nothing running, dude.

196
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, I guess so.

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay, so I got to...

198
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Shit.

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You jump and get those coins.

200
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Kind of just have to get out of the way.

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Get that last one.

202
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, you...oh, come on!

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That was so not fair.

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Grab that one.

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Almost died.

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Who's this?

207
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I don't even know what happened.

208
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm the cannon.

209
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay, I was the cannon.

210
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I thought I was the guy in the painting.

211
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
For a second, I thought I was going to shoot laser beams out of my eyes.

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Alrighty.

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can do better than that.

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm making fun of a lava.

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Nope.

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I will now.

217
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Whoa!

218
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I shouldn't have shot the second.

219
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That was a stupid idea.

220
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I shouldn't have shot the second time.

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please, please.

222
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That doesn't sound sense.

223
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There we go.

224
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Thought I was the flag.

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, it gets real confusing when you have to control two different things at the same time.

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm going to try to just air-shot them.

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'll be able to.

228
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Forget about the ghost.

229
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We're just going to go with a direct shot in the air.

230
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll get him.

231
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Don't worry, guys.

232
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Just pop some popcorn or something.

233
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He'll come back and he'll be gone.

234
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That was total dog shit.

235
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I hit him right in the face.

236
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Ghosts just go down there.

237
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Ghosts.

238
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah.

239
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No, come.

240
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I have to shoot him in the air.

241
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh, I just figured it out accidentally.

242
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He's at it again.

243
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The green coins will make...

244
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Alright, so shoot him.

245
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Get a knock him up to the...

246
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh.

247
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Fuck.

248
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Thank God they put that safety net right there.

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I would never have done that.

250
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'll just shoot fireballs.

251
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'll smash to the ground while in the air.

252
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Can I...

253
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I could probably make that jump, huh?

254
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Nope.

255
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I knock him up in the air when I do that.

256
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I got it.

257
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Easy.

258
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Why don't you walk forward?

259
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
There's no reason for him to walk forward.

260
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Ooh, he's invincible.

261
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay, I got him.

262
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Hold on, hold on. I need a second to think about this.

263
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh boy, hold on a minute.

264
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I can't land on that.

265
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Shouldn't I be able to?

266
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I guess I can move.

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Shit.

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Fucking all four of them.

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
All four of them?

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Why did I say four of them?

271
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There was like 10 of four of them.

272
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I gotta make it over here.

273
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Damn. Where are the coins?

274
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
He's invincible.

275
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I gotta drop him.

276
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I have to drop him.

277
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Shit, I dropped myself.

278
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Do I have to...

279
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah, I gotta go all the way across.

280
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This one's actually gonna be pretty tough.

281
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I just need to get all the way around my fat fucking sloppy body.

282
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
See ya.

283
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Hey, that was the first world I believe.

284
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What?

285
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Don't cry, Princess.

286
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We have taken care of your stalker flummer.

287
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You don't have to transfer to another castle anymore.

288
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We won.

289
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yay.

290
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Onto the next world.

291
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This is the sand level.

292
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What is this?

293
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You need 15 stars more.

294
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I need more stars.

295
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That's total stars, I guess.

296
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Whatever, we're just gonna play the...

297
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I can go back.

298
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
World, or...

299
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
He's heading for the princess to destroy him.

300
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Look at that face, shit, my god.

301
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
We got the princess.

302
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Stop him.

303
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I think I'm a bumpers head, I think.

304
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh, come on, that is what you have to do.

305
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You have to get him caught there and then...

306
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You plumber.

307
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah.

308
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
No.

309
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This one's tricky.

310
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You gotta get him caught.

311
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But he has such a huge frame hitbox.

312
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I got him to... oh, I got a sub-emote coming in.

313
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It just has to get approved.

314
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Huh?

315
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Jump over him and then...

316
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh, I got it, okay.

317
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So he's gonna jump over this one.

318
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And then I have to let him jump on this one up to hit that one.

319
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Sort of.

320
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Got to catch him right in the middle.

321
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Not gonna fool me.

322
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
He's gonna get the coins.

323
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh, wait just a second.

324
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He jumps the first one.

325
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't want him to win.

326
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Interesting.

327
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Huh.

328
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yep, you gotta get him to drop down that way.

329
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So he has to jump.

330
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The first one and the second one right about here.

331
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Almost got it.

332
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
There.

333
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
One, two, three, four.

334
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Get the last one.

335
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Oh, you prick.

336
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
They're getting a little harder here.

337
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Jump that one.

338
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What did I do?

339
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What did I do?

340
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
He has to jump this one.

341
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Get that coin.

342
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Now he has flight.

343
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Well, that's not fair.

344
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So I just gonna wait and just jump right in his face.

345
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
He just jumped over me.

346
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
No, I gotta get him up here.

347
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:48,000
There we go.

348
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I didn't have any reactions either.

349
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Just my luck.

350
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
He's gonna get them all and then he's gonna fall and I'm gonna die.

351
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So now he's gonna be running.

352
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
He's out of the flying.

353
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
The ears.

354
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And then I just gotta be there right when he lands right here.

355
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Nice pin point.

356
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Hacking accuracy you have right there, by the way.

357
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Shoot one down.

358
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And then right there.

359
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Chronic waffle.

360
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Thank you for subscribing.

361
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Welcome to the coaster.

362
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You know the joke that we did before.

363
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Boomerang.

364
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And jump and use the boomerang.

365
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Let me just hide.

366
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm gonna play that again.

367
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Thanks for subbing though.

368
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Appreciate it.

369
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Can have two out at one time.

370
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Okay.

371
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Can I get him too?

372
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The leaf freak out at that.

373
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
He's not going that far.

374
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I think I'm missing something here.

375
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Does he jump at all?

376
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
He doesn't have to.

377
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Huh.

378
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Oh the fuck is happening.

379
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Oh.

380
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Oh.

381
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay.

382
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
All right.

383
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Get him right in his touchy.

384
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Got ya.

385
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Spams him until...

386
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Okay.

387
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I have to...

388
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Just throw behind me in the dodge.

389
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
No, this is a sock.

390
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I have thrown a sock as a weapon.

391
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That's great.

392
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
What am I now?

393
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
What the hell is that?

394
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh.

395
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
All right.

396
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I turn into a shell.

397
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And I do the Cooper Trooper shell thing.

398
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
No. Get up.

399
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Get up.

400
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Get up.

401
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Fuck.

402
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I think I feel like I have the right idea here.

403
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But not the right execution.

404
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Because he needs to hit himself into me.

405
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I didn't work.

406
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
He died.

407
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
He fell down the hole.

408
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Oh, Drexter.

409
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Thanks for subscribing.

410
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I was reading chat and I won.

411
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Literally reading that somebody subscribed

412
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and I beat the level.

413
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I have no idea what happened.

414
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Thanks for something, dude.

415
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yes, there isn't an emote coming later today.

416
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I promise.

417
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
He can just fly, though.

418
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
What the fuck is going on?

419
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Do I have to just move this all the way down here?

420
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Because he can...

421
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Hold on.

422
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I need a second to think about this.

423
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
He can fly.

424
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Do I have to bring this up?

425
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Oh, would you look at that?

426
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Would you look at that?

427
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Are you serious?

428
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That's what I have to do.

429
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Why is he hitting it?

430
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
What the fuck just happened?

431
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I don't even know.

432
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't know.

433
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Somebody else subbed too.

434
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Man.

435
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Thanks for something, dude.

436
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'm going to mess up your name.

437
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
A prey.

438
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
A Peru.

439
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Thanks for subscribing.

440
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I love you.

441
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I don't know what to say.

442
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I don't know what the fuck to say.

443
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Ah.

444
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So that's another bright idea.

445
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I just have to knock him into the first one.

446
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Maybe wait until he gets on this one.

447
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yep.

448
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And then he...

449
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Shit.

450
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I have to go backwards, so that's for sure.

451
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The block on the left.

452
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh my god, he's a moron.

453
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Come on.

454
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You ready?

455
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Oh.

456
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I feel like that was it.

457
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I feel like that was probably it.

458
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Kind of.

459
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah, it was.

460
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I just have to bounce him to this one.

461
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Come on.

462
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Come on.

463
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Get it.

464
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Maybe not.

465
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
There it is.

466
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Now what do I do?

467
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Is it one of these times he's going to be an idiot?

468
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Or is this just done?

469
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Is this over?

470
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah, this is over.

471
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Here comes the first one.

472
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
All right, I'm going to sit right here.

473
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Let's damn it.

474
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Damn it.

475
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
There it is.

476
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
He didn't pick it.

477
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
He didn't pick up the second coin.

478
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
He's got a lot of things to do.

479
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'm going to sit right here.

480
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Let's damn it.

481
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Damn it.

482
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
There it is.

483
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
He didn't pick it.

484
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
He didn't pick up the second coin.

485
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
He's got a lot of things to do.

486
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
He didn't pick up the second coin.

487
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
He's got both.

488
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh, you disappointed me completely.

489
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Actually, that is what I have to do.

490
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Grab the first one.

491
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Grab the second one.

492
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'll get it.

493
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I don't even know.

494
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Fuck.

495
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Why did I just hit restart?

496
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That was so dumb.

497
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I just had it right there.

498
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I just had it.

499
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
He has to jump over twice.

500
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Oh, this is going to drive me crazy.

501
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Why is he not touching that coin?

502
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Get it.

503
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Just jump.

504
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Just do the jump.

505
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Like you've been trained your whole life for.

506
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'm going to jump over twice.

507
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm going to jump over twice.

508
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm going to jump over twice.

509
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm going to jump over twice.

510
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Why is he not touching that coin?

511
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
My whole life for.

512
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Not Mario.

513
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
This music.

514
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm going to hear this music in my sleep.

515
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I got him.

516
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Three started.

517
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
First beat of throw up to three spikers.

518
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Move sideways.

519
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It would be deep.

520
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Oh, you get to be the most his name.

521
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Look at the key to.

522
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Right.

523
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And I'm right his head.

524
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I got him right in the crown of his head.

525
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Well, they can't die.

526
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Really.

527
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
How can they walk in there?

528
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
They don't die.

529
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Will he just walk?

530
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh, I have to control him.

531
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Right.

532
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I forgot.

533
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
All right.

534
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
This is what we're going to do.

535
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I put him here.

536
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You fucker.

537
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
One here.

538
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Okay.

539
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Go for it, Mario.

540
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I don't know what to do.

541
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
What do I do?

542
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I don't know.

543
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I think that's it.

544
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm pretty sure that's it.

545
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm just going to drop him onto him.

546
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's the only thing i'm going to,

547
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm just going to drop him on him.

548
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Just like playing magic on a different Minecraft.

549
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm just going to try to do that another way.

550
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Almost 1 a.m. here in South Korea.

551
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That's late. We are on opposite sides of the world.

552
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Have a good sleep.

553
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That's way too long for me to understand what was going on.

554
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
No, you don't think I know what to do?

555
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You guys think I'm some kind of dummy, huh?

556
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah, three stars.

557
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Okay.

558
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I thought I was going to get three stars, but turns out I'm only going to get one.

559
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Got you.

560
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And then when I'm just staying right here.

561
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Right here.

562
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And then right here.

563
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Am I going to play more vermin tide?

564
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I mean, really the reason why I'm streaming, I'm just taking a break from making my latest video.

565
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I ran into a spot where I'm just way home.

566
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Move out and in of the box.

567
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Oh, I'm a little chump.

568
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:38,000
But my next video is just taking time to make.

569
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's just like it's like I'm taking a break.

570
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I'm just like, I don't want to do it.

571
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'm just going to stream for like an hour or two and then maybe do something.

572
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Maybe we're going a little more.

573
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh, one is up and one is down.

574
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Smart.

575
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
He didn't even have to do it.

576
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
He just jumped and threw his stuff.

577
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
This is a fireball one.

578
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
He killed it.

579
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
All right, well, I'll just wait till he comes down here then.

580
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What do I care?

581
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
He's going to get the coins. Just shoot him.

582
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
That's why.

583
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So right when he's right in the middle is when I'm going to pop up.

584
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So right now.

585
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,000
What does he do?

586
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So I have to wait till he gets down to the lower like the butt crack and the lower left

587
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and then I'll be all right.

588
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Walk into it.

589
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I can turn and I can shoot guys.

590
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I can turn and I can shoot.

591
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Did not know.

592
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Oh, that's kind of awkward.

593
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Does this even hurt him?

594
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I don't think I can hurt him yet.

595
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
How am I going to get him to jump here though?

596
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Shit.

597
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh, that was too busy pay.

598
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Shoot the fucking right way you moron.

599
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
This is much more awkward than it looks. Trust me.

600
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,000
All right, just going to keep it right there.

601
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Just look at the zero stars. I don't care.

602
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So you can kill him.

603
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Obviously I have to wait till he turns and boost him up.

604
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
What are you doing?

605
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
No.

606
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,000
No.

607
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
No.

608
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You're going to scare him.

609
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So this comes up.

610
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Drop that. This comes up.

611
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I'm not doing this one right at all.

612
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I think I have to boost him up.

613
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So he jumps up on this one.

614
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So jump.

615
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Or does he have to hit both?

616
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Maybe he has to hit both.

617
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Make them both come out.

618
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Yeah, there we go.

619
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And there it is.

620
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
One, two, three, four.

621
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Gotcha.

622
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
My next plane how this works.

623
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You play as the enemies and you have to kill the AI Mario.

624
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Swim sideways with a deep head and swim up with A.

625
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Now you're a fish.

626
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Just get killed.

627
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
100 lives lost.

628
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Cool.

629
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Airborne archer.

630
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Welcome to the jock shockers.

631
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Enjoy your stay.

632
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You are now a certified licensed shock joker.

633
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Shit.

634
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Maybe I should wait till he bumps into the wall.

635
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I don't know what to do.

636
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I'm going to send him sideways.

637
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
See you.

638
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Bye bye.

639
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Same deal, right?

640
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
That was three stars gone immediately.

641
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I can just lock him over here, right?

642
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I don't know.

643
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I wonder how do you do that one with three stars?

644
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I don't know.

645
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah, if you're a subscriber to this channel,

646
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
you obviously are certified shock jokking jock shocker.

647
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I mean, why wouldn't you be?

648
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I don't know.

649
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
This one I think is just patience.

650
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
He will jump.

651
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
He will, okay, he will not jump to go to the flag.

652
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I can do this one a little more clearly.

653
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Make him get all the ones on the bottom.

654
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Make him jump and get this one.

655
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Maybe not all of them, but at this point, you know,

656
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
who gives his shit?

657
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Just try to get him to collect the coins.

658
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm going to stay over here for this.

659
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I do not want him to get.

660
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
He obviously has to get that one last.

661
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I went down to one star.

662
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Damn it.

663
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So how I hope to let him kill him when he does this?

664
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
That's time, this right?

665
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Fucking it.

666
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Eat my ass.

667
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That was uncalled for.

668
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
That was just completely uncalled for.

669
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Sorry.

670
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I know everyone asks about Germany and German rumble,

671
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
but do you actually have plans for another one?

672
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm not asking.

673
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I don't even need to read the rest of this.

674
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I can give you an answer.

675
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, a thousand times.

676
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Yes.

677
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You're just going to have to trust me on this one.

678
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I want to see a new one just as bad as you do.

679
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You can quote me on that.

680
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
And it will happen.

681
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:08,000
It's going to happen.

682
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I'm glad you are as enthusiastic as I'm glad you're enthusiastic about it because it's

683
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
like one of my favorite things to do.

684
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And this one will be absolutely no exception.

685
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Zero stars.

686
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Spring 2016 is when you can know that you'll see it.

687
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I am looking forward to it.

688
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
More than probably any video I've probably ever made.

689
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Or ever will make.

690
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
That's all I'm going to say.

691
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Swim sideways with a deep head and swim up with a.

692
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So just to be the octopus guy.

693
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I did it again.

694
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I just pixel perfect.

695
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I did it again.

696
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I did it again.

697
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I did it like a fourth time in a row.

698
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Just let him walk into you.

699
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I did it again.

700
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I did it again.

701
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Thank God the pixels lined up.

702
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Well, that's different.

703
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
That is a different pattern.

704
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Right there.

705
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Right in the V.

706
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Just going to swim in the V.

707
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
We just like the mighty ducks.

708
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
That's the idea.

709
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
But I've got to get it.

710
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Got it.

711
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I got a couple of little ones now.

712
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I think I get what they want me to do here.

713
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I think it's collect all these little guys and just stick them out and have them walk into it.

714
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
That's what we're going to do.

715
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And that's what we needed to do.

716
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Oh, shit.

717
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
What am I doing?

718
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
He's invincible.

719
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Will he just fall down and collect these?

720
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
No, I got him.

721
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Ah, this sucks.

722
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So he's going to shoot right when he lends.

723
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Ah.

724
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Ah.

725
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Just come on.

726
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Just get it.

727
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Just get it.

728
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
That's so trolled.

729
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Really is.

730
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Really is.

731
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I'm just...

732
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Then he doesn't even do it.

733
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
No, don't look at that.

734
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Goodness.

735
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Fuck.

736
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
That's kind.

737
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Just be easy.

738
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
That's should...

739
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
He shouldn't have even done it like that.

740
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
He should have landed in a shot.

741
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:49,000
That was not even something I would consider cool.

742
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Why is he not jumping?

743
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
He's supposed to jump when he sees me.

744
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
He's supposed to jump over me.

745
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Just like that.

746
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
He did it.

747
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Now just don't do not die from the...

748
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
He's used months.

749
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
We're gonna get tickets for the next drama rumble.

750
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Well, it's gonna be free and on YouTube.

751
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I die.

752
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:21,000
This woman's dash fall would be.

753
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Come here.

754
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Get away.

755
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I'm gonna get you.

756
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'll get you.

757
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Gotta be fast, but...

758
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Gotta fucking quick.

759
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Gotta be quick.

760
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Can I fit through here?

761
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
No.

762
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Okay.

763
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Ooh.

764
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So that's dropping.

765
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Okay.

766
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
So smash.

767
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Smash.

768
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Fuck.

769
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Fuck.

770
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Okay, slow it out.

771
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Slow it out.

772
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Yeah, bring him right where you'll want him.

773
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Okay.

774
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Slow, slow, slow.

775
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It literally drops.

776
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Did he seriously squeak by?

777
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,000
He squeaked through and now he stuck over here?

778
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I don't even feel like that.

779
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
That's even...

780
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Just restart it.

781
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Not on my watch.

782
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That's some aggressive clicking.

783
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah, it kind of is.

784
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I get it.

785
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I know what the woman to do.

786
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
They want me to go back and forth.

787
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Shit.

788
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I gotta fall all the way down here.

789
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Not that far.

790
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Not that far.

791
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Not that far.

792
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Right there.

793
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
All right.

794
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Right in the middle.

795
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I'm thinking right in the middle, right?

796
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I was holding down the button, by the way.

797
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
He's not going to hit me from right in the middle.

798
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Of course he will.

799
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Of course he'll still hit me.

800
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Of course he'll hit me there too.

801
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I've about to do a little bit of, I've been raging.

802
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
One, two, three, four.

803
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Smash.

804
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Ah!

805
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So you gotta do two spaces.

806
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
When he gets these coins, please do not.

807
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Please come on.

808
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I'm being a little whiner right now.

809
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I'll get it.

810
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And then one, two.

811
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Now I just have to not die.

812
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And then right when he grabs that coin.

813
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Wipe it off.

814
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Wipe off.

815
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I give one star.

816
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It's perfect.

817
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
All right.

818
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
What is he supposed to be grabbing?

819
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

820
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Go all the way up.

821
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
You can shoot up.

822
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
That's such a bullshit.

823
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I had the right idea.

824
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Gotta go all the way up to the top.

825
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I do that again.

826
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I swear to God, I'm gonna put this controller into the drywall.

827
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
It hurts.

828
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
It hurts.

829
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Why is it bouncing?

830
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
There should not be an added fucking flop on this.

831
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You should be fucking bouncing.

832
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,000
No, God.

833
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Ugh.

834
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Get out of the way.

835
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Get out of the way.

836
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Get out of the way.

837
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Out of the way.

838
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I don't care about three stars.

839
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I just want to win.

840
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Crush him.

841
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Crush him.

842
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Nice relaxing game.

843
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Don't cry, Princess.

844
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
We have trapped your stalker plumber forever in the minus world.

845
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
We are now safe here on this island.

846
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
We won.

847
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
We won.

848
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Is there a minute I can go back here?

849
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
No.

850
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
15 more stars.

851
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Are there even 15 stars available to get here?

852
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Five?

853
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Yeah, I have to do three stars on every single level.

854
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Fuck that.

855
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I can't see you.

856
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:02,000
We are in the ice level now.

857
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Why is he like a maniacal psycho?

858
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
He will pay with his blood.

859
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So he is still winning.

860
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'm assuming there is going to be a lot of slip in his lead.

861
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And it's a nice level.

862
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:31,000
What a dummy.

863
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Okay, so we obviously have to just get him stuck.

864
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Can't jump.

865
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I'm not going to jump over it.

866
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I'm not over that.

867
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:11,000
How is he not jumping on that?

868
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I'm going to have to get it next time.

869
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Oh, I freaked out again.

870
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I hate controlling two characters.

871
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I walked off the screen with this other guy.

872
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'm going to get him stuck in the game.

873
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Numbers are plummeting.

874
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:58,000
And then I get to follow him.

875
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I'm just running quick enough.

876
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I still might be able to do it.

877
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I'm going to get him stuck.

878
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Why am I blue?

879
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Interesting.

880
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
It hurts my head.

881
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
You have to hold right the whole time.

882
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Right is left and left is right down there.

883
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Oh, forget that.

884
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I'm assuming he's going to go like that.

885
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Oh, let him look as bark.

886
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:02,000
He's going to be easy on him.

887
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Oh, I just hit the blast.

888
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I have to last the whole time with it.

889
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Is this the only safe spot here on the right?

890
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Kind of.

891
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I wish I could jump a little bit everywhere.

892
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
It sounds like me.

893
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Where are you taking my blood off my back?

894
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Young creepess Jump.

895
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It's me.

896
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000

saying stealth what are you talking about

922
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:05,000
he just clipped through did land on me he clipped through this fucking asshole

923
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
this stupid plumber this dumb plumber guy thought he could just clip through

924
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:21,000
now I'll give you a clip it's the backwards right is left and left is right

925
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
it's gonna screw me up a thousand times

926
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:41,000
nice screw it up again so close so what are you doing wait till he gets down

927
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:49,000
here I forget everything okay I remember I forget I remember I forget I forget

928
01:01:49,000 --> 01:02:02,000
right is left and left is right why did he jump there of all places why did he

929
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,000
jump there and that was so dumb he did it again telling me so one of the

930
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:16,000
developers is controlling the character right now causing me all kinds of hell

931
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I just wish the clipping I wish he actually had to jump on me I got a feeling

932
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:39,000
this stream will end soon maybe that was it but he didn't do it he didn't go the

933
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:50,000
all the way I should get it right here I didn't do it again there it is

934
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:00,000
finally what is it if I got a little hat does it mean anything

935
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
am I getting my good slowdowns right there what the hell man this is a two-dimensional

936
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
game I should not be getting three-dimensional lag in a two-dimensional game

937
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,000
all right I'm just gonna have to wait for right he's eventually he has to jump he's

938
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
gonna have to jump eventually right

939
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:52,000
to do yeah well all right yeah we're gonna both I'll just bore him to death

940
01:03:52,000 --> 01:04:08,000
it doesn't matter he's not going anywhere he's not gonna move

941
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:22,000
what am I supposed to do then go take a shower yeah everyone just got mad at me for

942
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:30,000
not for moving and I'm not moving and then nothing happened we're gonna move I have

943
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:39,000
a little an opportunity like I have a small window see how I'm like walking still I sure I can't

944
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
fly with this hat then they tell me about the snowballs when did they tell me about the snowballs

945
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:52,000
they never told me about the snowballs well just got to make it bounce correctly

946
01:04:52,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I wish I knew about that before saved me a lot of bullshit

947
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
hit him right in his nuts

948
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:22,000
yeah going right kills you you just have to it you just got to get this like perfect

949
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:49,000
that was not perfect one two okay maybe right on the back end of it I'm gonna have to get it right

950
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:09,000
on the right side like right there if I can close I don't care about the time or anymore

951
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I'm gonna win talk about lose my goddamn mind thank you thank you just spam spam snowballs who cares

952
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:50,000
that was actually gonna work kind of I feel like I'm playing one of those elaborate mini golf games

953
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:59,000
where you have to land it perfectly that's what I have to do here I have to use that kind of little

954
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:07,000
double jump that you get from throwing the snowball to get back there it is

955
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:19,000
gorgeous I got confused because I didn't know I didn't I thought I was still

956
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:37,000
controlling the little snow people really going I don't know zero stars that's just not

957
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
cool

958
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:55,000
there we go I gotta get him to jump to the left who is the water

959
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:29,000
so it's one two one two I'm not gonna lie guys I could sit here and like figure this out but I

960
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:36,000
kind of just want to do this until it works I could care less right now

961
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:57,000
and there we go using all Oculus Rift for pre-order January 6th I probably puke if I play Oculus Rift I

962
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:08,000
will throw up if I play anything on Oculus Rift I'm missing something I gotta get him to hit the spikes

963
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:23,000
or not just shoot him right in the stomach that works oh that was so close

964
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:40,000
that would be quicker than that shit he's hitting the other one accidentally I don't want him to

965
01:09:41,000 --> 01:10:04,000
here we go all right we can toss his brain out I'm assuming I need to keep both of

966
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:21,000
their helmets yes okay see you later do I break stuff when I get angry no not really I kind of

967
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,000
just say a couple of swear words and then I'm done with it and go on with my day

968
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:46,000
actually does they regenerate don't want to die I'm not just get a money comes back on the other side

969
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,000
they am I crazy or did they regenerate last time I felt like they did

970
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:14,000
shit I hit the button accidentally I hit the stupid how am I gonna kill him by the way if I get him to

971
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
do this how am I gonna actually kill him I didn't really think about that

972
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:48,000
what if he lands on one does it will they stay dead or will they come back they stay dead I think

973
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I just would be perfect when he lands like right when he lands I'm getting some weird slowdowns

974
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:06,000
here too by the way right when he jumps right here oh it's definitely like I'm in the lag it's

975
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:16,000
definitely lag spot all lag there we go

976
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:25,000
he

977
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I had almost had the first try.

978
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
See ya.

979
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:57,000
That's three stats.

980
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Kind of lucky.

981
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
That was like the same level without the whole.

982
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Whoa.

983
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:26,000
This is gonna take a little bit of a.

984
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Alright, let me just.

985
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Let me do something here.

986
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I can't go through it even when it's.

987
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I thought I could go through it or something.

988
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Now I'm gonna pee my pants.

989
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Hopefully I can end this soon.

990
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Shit, that's a way to go though.

991
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Shit, fuck.

992
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Alright, I think this might be the last level.

993
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
What's wrong with my guy?

994
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
What was the point of that level?

995
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
These guys don't really do anything.

996
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Okay, they do not get hurt from the fire.

997
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Can they get stepped on?

998
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I want to see if they can get stepped on.

999
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:59,000
You know, I'm gonna assume these are like the bone characters in Mario where they come back to life and I'm gonna have to make somebody go down.

1000
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Let's see if that theory is true.

1001
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Yes it is.

1002
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I have to set these guys up in a spot where.

1003
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Oh, and especially needing to pee is it gonna be tough.

1004
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,000
They have to stay on their respective levels, I think.

1005
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:35,000
One.

1006
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Space like this for a reason.

1007
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Shit.

1008
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:56,000
That may have just been my ticket to make him go up there.

1009
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Kind of, right?

1010
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I think.

1011
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Why does he go jump and get that first one?

1012
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:17,000
So he has to make him go up and then.

1013
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I think now I have to bring him down.

1014
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Yeah.

1015
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,000
No, stop doing the things I don't tell you to do.

1016
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:44,000
We're gonna have a gap problem.

1017
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Okay, now technically I shouldn't need to care about that guy.

1018
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:57,000
But now how does he get up there?

1019
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:12,000
He blew it already.

1020
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
It's the way that they're spaced.

1021
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I almost need another person.

1022
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Kind of confused on how you get him to jump over there.

1023
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Unless I have to, I kind of have to bring them down, right?

1024
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Yeah, I'm gonna be slow with this one.

1025
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Oh, you fucking.

1026
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I don't think you can do it like that.

1027
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Because he'll just hit it every time.

1028
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Long to fight that.

1029
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Give your subscriber welcome to the.

1030
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Whatever I'm calling people.

1031
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Thank you so much.

1032
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Thank you very much. Welcome. Welcome.

1033
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:19,000
The way that they're spaced.

1034
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Almost leads me to believe.

1035
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Right now this might sound crazy.

1036
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,000
This might sound crazy. I am crazy. It's wrong.

1037
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I don't think he can jump up here.

1038
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Can he even make that jump?

1039
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Hey, he gets up there.

1040
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
But shit.

1041
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I think I got it. I think I got it.

1042
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I think I got it.

1043
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
I'm pretty sure I got it.

1044
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I'm pretty sure I figured it out.

1045
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I think he gets that one.

1046
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
He'll jump over here.

1047
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And then this needs this guy needs to be over here.

1048
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Because then he can he can jump this way up there.

1049
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Oh.

1050
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Wait, how do I kill him?

1051
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
How do I kill him?

1052
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I don't know how I'm gonna kill him.

1053
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And I'm scared because I don't know.

1054
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Okay, I know how to do it.

1055
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I got a I think.

1056
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
No, I don't.

1057
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
How do I kill this guy?

1058
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
No. What do I do?

1059
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Somebody please tell me before I die.

1060
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Oh, that's what you gotta do.

1061
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I don't even care about zero stars.

1062
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I gotta say I gotta be so slow with this.

1063
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:49,000
New past zero.

1064
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I don't care.

1065
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Oh, right.

1066
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:07,000
I was thinking I could clip him.

1067
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
This music doesn't fit by the way.

1068
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:16,000
This music is like the price is right.

1069
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
This is the song they play when you guess correctly

1070
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
the amount of money something is on the price is right.

1071
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Then Bob Barker calls you to the stage.

1072
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Does that kill me?

1073
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Yes, it does.

1074
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Wait a minute.

1075
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:45,000
What, what, what can, why can those be exploded?

1076
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Cheeky.

1077
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Very clever.

1078
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Bob Barker is dead, German.

1079
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Well, who's the new guy?

1080
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Drew Carey, right?

1081
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:09,000
That one was pretty easy.

1082
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I just gotta, I get it.

1083
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I thought I got it.

1084
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I don't know if it's explode.

1085
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
You need to drop him.

1086
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
See ya.

1087
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
This is it.

1088
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Last level.

1089
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Last level.

1090
01:21:31,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I'm gonna take the giant Furby and jump with the giant Furby.

1091
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And then bounce again and get him to get the coins.

1092
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Right?

1093
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:15,000
This is the last boss.

1094
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
So what makes him jump?

1095
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,000
This.

1096
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:29,000
So how does he get the coins?

1097
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I kinda have the right idea.

1098
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Can I blow him up?

1099
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I'm gonna blow him up.

1100
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Ah!

1101
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Explode him into the coins.

1102
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Will he actually, yeah, he doesn't seem to get hit by the explosive to go up.

1103
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:23,000
We're gonna restart it.

1104
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Now why does that matter?

1105
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Having them go up that high.

1106
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:32,000
There has to be a reason for that.

1107
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I gotta wait till he go.

1108
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
You didn't touch the coins.

1109
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:45,000
You worked so all over those coins.

1110
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Now I'm just getting sloppy.

1111
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I don't even know what I'm being sloppy on, be honest.

1112
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
There we go.

1113
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Letting the gentleman beat the game.

1114
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Cause, sick ya.

1115
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
That should be it, right?

1116
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Unless there's a super secret level.

1117
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
This is a super secret level.

1118
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:10,000
A secret.

1119
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Oh, man.

1120
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Too many things to have to think about at the same time.

1121
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Cause I can get, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1122
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Can I get hit by any of these?

1123
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
No, so I was freaking out for no reason.

1124
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Just put him all the way over here.

1125
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Bring down a guy.

1126
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
And now we just slowly inch our way over.

1127
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
We just screw it all up.

1128
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
That works too.

1129
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Just start it over.

1130
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Cause then I can get a good read on it.

1131
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Don't fall off.

1132
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I'm falling off.

1133
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Shit.

1134
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1135
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
How far can I go?

1136
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
That's how far I can go.

1137
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I'm perfectly timing these to get hit by the fireballs.

1138
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Oh, man.

1139
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:30,000
This one is not easy.

1140
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
This sucks.

1141
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
This sucks so bad.

1142
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:40,000
This sucks.

1143
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Thankfully.

1144
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
New best.

1145
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Another one.

1146
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,000
That was easier than the last one.

1147
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Tony, more of these are there.

1148
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1149
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
No, no, no, no.

1150
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I already know.

1151
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I'm just going to be able to do this.

1152
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I just have to focus on the guy in the lower right.

1153
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Eventually the bomb's going to drop.

1154
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And I can blow it up.

1155
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Come on.

1156
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
You freeze.

1157
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Look it ready.

1158
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I'm tapping jump right now.

1159
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:39,000
There's a point where you cannot move.

1160
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I can pee.

1161
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I got a pee.

1162
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I got a goma.

1163
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:53,000
That's so annoying.

1164
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:02,000
And there's a point where I have to bring him to the right too.

1165
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Damn it.

1166
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I'm not really sure a good place to be standing.

1167
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Just take it slow.

1168
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Only three more times.

1169
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:40,000
No, I can get him right here.

1170
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:51,000
I'm getting too close.

1171
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I think that might be it.

1172
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Yay.

1173
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
This is it, Princess.

1174
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
It's over.

1175
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Hey, it's over.

1176
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
We have frozen your stalker plumber forever.

1177
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:10,000
You are now safe here in this ice cat cell.

1178
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Period.

1179
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:18,000
We want to be actually win.

1180
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I don't know.

1181
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Yay.

1194
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Michael, why am I doing this?

1195
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
It's fun.

1196
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
That was a fun little game.

1197
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:11,000
That was a fun little game, guys.

1198
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I want to see if there's something.

1199
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
There's a secret.

1200
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
There's definitely a secret.

1201
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:27,000
There's always a secret.

1202
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Who's FGL?

1203
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I'm just waiting to the very end.

1204
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Just the secret that's always there.

1205
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Here we go.

1206
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
The secret credits level.

1207
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Thank you for playing.

1208
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,000
And by the way, I forgot to mention here's the secret.

1209
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Gonna pop up.

1210
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
The end.

1211
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Question mark.

1212
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Okay.

1213
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Yeah.

1214
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Yeah.

1215
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:31,000
What is the secret?

1216
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Fine.

1217
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
There is something that I do want to see.

1218
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I got some notification.

1219
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
No.

1220
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
No notification.

1221
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
What's this?

1222
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
These are my trophies.

1223
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
See?

1224
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
A beat level 36.

1225
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I beat it.

1226
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I got a bunch of trophies.

1227
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Beat speed run mode and map three in under six minutes.

1228
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Kill the plumber 100 times.

1229
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Kill the plumber 9 times.

1230
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I'm going to assume this is 250.

1231
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Kill the plumber before the timer runs out on level 23.

1232
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
These are like achievements.

1233
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
That's cool.

1234
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
It might be worth trying.

1235
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Okay.

1236
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
I'm going to peak.

1237
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
So those of you that need to peak, OP.

1238
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
And then we're going to, I just to see what this even is.

1239
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I'm going to try to get three stars on a few more levels.

1240
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
So I can potentially unlock that.

1241
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Whatever that held that is.

1242
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I don't know.

1243
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
A couple minutes.

1244
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I'm going to do a few more.

1245
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000

1246

I'm going to do a few more.

1261
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I'm going to do a few more.

1262
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I'm going to do a few more.

1263
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I'm going to do a few more.

1264

I'm going to do a few more.

1268
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I'm going to do a few more.

1269
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I'm going to do a few more.

1270
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I'm going to do a few more.

1271
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Am I getting mad?

1272
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Am I getting mad?

1273
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Get me a dog.

1274
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Ato.

1275
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Ato.

1276
01:33:44,000 --> 01:34:11,000
He's sitting on that mat so much sitting on that mat.

1277
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
He's sitting on the toilet.

1278
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Who is it like a 60 second piss?

1279
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
You guys have never had one of those before?

1280
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,000
You tell me no, you're lying.

1281
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Alright, this one.

1282
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:30,000
One star, what did I do wrong here?

1283
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Yeah, I couldn't figure this one out.

1284
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:39,000
I can't get up there.

1285
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Unless I'm missing something which I don't think I am.

1286
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,000
How am I supposed to get up there?

1287
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:56,000
How do you not get one star on this level?

1288
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Ato.

1289
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Bibi.

1290
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:04,000
See, you don't even.

1291
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Oh, they don't move thing, right?

1292
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Yeah, okay.

1293
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1294
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:16,000
That's before I remembered you could even do that.

1295
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Okay, let's...

1296
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Let's just walk.

1297
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
There we go.

1298
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
So that is all of them completed on this as three stars.

1299
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I still need 12 more.

1300
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Alright.

1301
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Now, he does he move.

1302
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I wonder if he moves.

1303
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
No, I guess he's got a...

1304
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Oh, he does move.

1305
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
He does move.

1306
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Okay.

1307
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
That's an odd timing.

1308
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:14,000
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1309
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
After six seconds.

1310
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
How long does this take?

1311
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
One, two, three.

1312
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Okay, so at three seconds, I need to throw it.

1313
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,000
One, two, three, four, five.

1314
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:33,000
No, at four seconds, one, two, three, four, five, six.

1315
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:40,000
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1316
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:52,000
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1317
01:36:52,000 --> 01:37:00,000
What the fuck, one, two, three, four, five?

1318
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Thankfully, I'm not as dumb as I look.

1319
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I'm way dumber.

1320
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Okay, so that's what you gotta do.

1321
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Wait, and then throw it right in this space.

1322
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
That's not cool.

1323
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:30,000
So I'm gonna move after the second one.

1324
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Shit, that's hard.

1325
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:45,000
That is hard.

1326
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Actually, that would be it.

1327
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:58,000
One, two, three, four, five.

1328
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,000
This one was atrocious-why.

1329
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
See, move again.

1330
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I think he's going to do the same thing.

1331
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
That, come on.

1332
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Now, that was what we like to call in this industry.

1333
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:27,000
That's what we like to call a real stanker.

1334
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Wait too late.

1335
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:41,000
That's what we like to call a real stanker.

1336
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I don't know anymore, do I need?

1337
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I'll pay more.

1338
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,000
What was wrong with this one?

1339
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I was moving away too much.

1340
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Okay, so I thought I could get through that whole thing.

1341
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:10,000
The very last second right when this one comes all the way over is when you have to start moving.

1342
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:19,000
And there it is.

1343
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:26,000
This one, 21.

1344
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,000
It's extremely easy.

1345
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Not much more to go.

1346
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I need five more.

1347
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.

1348
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:42,000
You just have to three-star every single level.

1349
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Shit, I don't know.

1350
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
This is going to be tough.

1351
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Considering that I need to get this like perfect.

1352
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Oh, boy.

1353
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
So it needs to be right.

1354
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Right?

1355
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
No.

1356
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:05,000
I didn't do it right.

1357
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I actually still might be able to get three if I can make it all the way down here.

1358
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Ah.

1359
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Oh, shit.

1360
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I don't know if I...

1361
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I just got to get over there.

1362
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:32,000
I can't.

1363
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I can't.

1364
01:41:42,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I can't.

1365
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I can't.

1366
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I can't.

1367
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I can't.

1368
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I can't.

1369
01:42:52,000 --> 01:43:02,000
I can't.

1370
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I can't.

1371
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:22,000
I can't.

1372
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
I can't.

1373
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I can't.

1374
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I can't.

1375
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:55,000
I can't.

1376
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I can't.

1377
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:15,000
I can't.

1378
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:21,000
I can't.

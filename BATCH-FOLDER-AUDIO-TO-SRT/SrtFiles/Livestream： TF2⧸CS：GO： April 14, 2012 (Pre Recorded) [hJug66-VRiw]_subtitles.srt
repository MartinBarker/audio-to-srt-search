00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone. German 985 here.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello, everyone. German 985.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, well, you can't lie to him like that.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What's up, guys?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Did anyone believe it?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
No one's even here to hear it, so.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, there are like 15-20 people already here.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, you're on Twitch, mother.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I am on the Twitch-itch.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Anyways, happy Saturday.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Happy Sunday if you're from a different country.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And let me show this out to people's.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Actually, I got to write, uh, app.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And they'll see.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh, come on.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, how come I can't bring up Brett, as I can app mentioned?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Maybe he blew up his Twitter.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
MLC stealth.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Like, I'm not even doing you either.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What's going on here, Twitter?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Twitter, what is going on?

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why are you being like this?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to tweet, too.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You could just retweet what I tweet.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You can all tweet.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can pick your dog.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You can tweet, I tweet, but you can't.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We all tweet for germistry.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And there we go.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
With at MLs.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, why that was weird.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't know why it didn't work before.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I wonder who that is.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And tweet.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No, no, no, tweet.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Come to it yet.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because I need to, uh, write it.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I already tweeted.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, no, it is.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, no, no, no, I was talking to myself, not to you.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Like, as I was telling myself, because I was going to hit the Twitter button.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And I didn't even put like the link.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I was like, no, no.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It has been Twittered.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And yes, it has.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And there's Twitter.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now go to YouTube.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And post that.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And then get out of there, because it's not necessary.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And set it stream.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Which means you're going to find, okay.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Good evening.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm going to play some team fortress too.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And then if you guys don't know, they just put out a huge, huge CS go update.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So that should be interesting to check out for sure.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's probably one of the big, they've added like five maps.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I would love to express my enthusiasm for that.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But the last.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I cannot.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You don't have it.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't have it.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't know.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I think they're going to release this coming soon.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think it's coming soon.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Otherwise did the update today was pretty huge.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So you know valve, though, it's going to be months, probably.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah, yeah, true.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Very true.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Good evening, everyone.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
All of you that are saying good evening.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So I want to show you.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You go tomorrow and go to tidings.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So let's get rolling.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
A mLC stealth is here.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But he's currently he's currently in the bathroom.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And that's all we're going to say about that.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So let's find a server that is an empty.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Do we need to wait for him before we join a server so that he can play?

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, there you go. There he is.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Perfect timing, sir. Thank you. I was waiting for the right moment to enter.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And I once seemed pretty good.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No, I was watching clips from the on-de-genera show.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What are you doing that? She's funny.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Sorry, I'm late. You're supposed to be in the stream.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Now let's get into the server. Let's try to find a 32-way-way-go.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
CPU Badlands. I don't know. I want to do CPU Badlands.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is 28. That's 2-4. It's trading.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, here we go. This is 2 out of 24.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
All right, you guys ready? Uh, not quite yet.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh, you better hurry up. I'm, I'm launching it.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's already on that screen. It's already on the screen.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I've already got Xbox connected. My console.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Ready to go. Wait a couple seconds.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh, by the way, if you guys may.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Everyone knows who Stealth is, but some people may not know who you are.

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Alex, go ahead and give an introduction.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hey guys, my name is Alex, and I make YouTube videos.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And my channel name is Gamers Descent, which you may know me by instead of a Talix.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That is where I hail from.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah, you come from the the monitoring top of Gamers Descent.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What time is it right now? It is 15 after 6 if people that were just saying that.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
All right, I'm ready.

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What are we going to say to Alex before I cut you off?

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't. Woo.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't know. I guess to further introduce myself, I'm a machinima realm director.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So I'm on, I'm on the other side of the chasm between the two machinima mountains.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I come in peace.

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Here we go. People have already started joining. Let's do it.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:04,000
68.177.101.44.27016.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You better go.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh, that confused me.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It has 16.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I've pressed 6 first.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, you better get in there.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Those teen numbers always confuse me.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Hey, I think so it still says, oh, I'm playing.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I didn't even update the dashboard either.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I think the good thing is still correct.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll get the change right now.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Put TF2 Moa hunting.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
TF2 Moa hunting.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
All you're going to do is get 25 kills in a row.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's very difficult to do in this game.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That is not an easy thing to do in team fortress to get more than,

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
more than I'd say, more than 15 kills in a row.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
10 kills in a row is even like a pretty big field strength.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The only one who could do it is a engineer.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah, I'll have you to have you can get a lot of engineer.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If nobody is like smart and going,

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Demoman or over medic.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I went on zero red team.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How's the game audio? Let's take a look.

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
How's the game audio guys?

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Good.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Check again.

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I cannot tell.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Are you going to tell them what's your name is?

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
People will probably figure it out by now.

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Dick Simmons, the dump champion.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, where's this scout going?

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's pretty nice player gun, dude.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh, I thought it was you.

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh, watch it.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, forgot fire kills me.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's going up pretty well here.

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
All right, what do I have for a melee right now?

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Actually, I got the postal pommel there.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
All right, let's try and get some postal pommel there kills.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, you know, you're not spying.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I need a medic.

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Oh, yeah, we did it.

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Game over.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh, we did it.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Good job.

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So we can do it again.

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Very cool.

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, we changed.

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I wanted to play on upwards.

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Oh, I love upward.

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I know.

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I love it too.

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Upward is one of my favorites.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Upward.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, what are we going to do?

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
My most kills is only 25 as a sniper.

170
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I would have only gotten one moeab.

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I have no idea.

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh, Thunder Mountain.

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Good.

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I love Thunder Mountain.

175
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I like the first two stages.

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Thunder Mountain.

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Germa, can I be has in a hug?

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If you ask him for a hug,

179
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
get ready.

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Internet hug.

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There we are.

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He, he, he,

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
be has him in your hug.

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Here we go.

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He has been in.

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Here comes the internet hug.

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You just received the internet hug.

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Look, worth 15 dollars.

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You've got hugs.

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's actually pretty good.

191
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You've got mail.

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, I have a new item.

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, I got a new item.

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm giving away my backpack.

195
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I finally got some new stuff.

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why am I even running?

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Waiting for players.

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What are we going?

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You guys, no one's got to give me stuff.

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I mean, items are one thing.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I have a, a nice plan.

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
As you probably saw in my latest video,

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
if you haven't,

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm going to do a crate unboxing video.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Whatever I get in those crates.

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If I get an unusual or something,

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
it's going to be given away.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So,

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
any unusual I get in the boxes,

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
it's going to be given away.

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And if I get strangers, they're mine.

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm keeping them.

213
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Now we got, we got a full server.

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I will prop the 24.

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah, there's this five spectators.

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Be sure some people are kind of stuck in the spectator right now.

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But the unboxing video will probably be

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
next week out as soon.

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I do.

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I do.

221
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Take seven, the dump champion.

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, that's me.

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Dick Simmons, the dump champion.

224
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Wait, did you put end quotes on that?

225
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think this is the parrots parentheses.

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's all I know.

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It should be on this stream.

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't think so.

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've been wrong before though.

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
All right, I close my door there.

231
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Should be as not on this stream.

232
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Not in the chat anyway.

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No, I'm not that I can see.

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
High five.

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Frank.

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Can I just kill somebody already?

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We got to wait.

238
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Instead of time, man.

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I want to blow them underneath the fence.

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, I ever played Dona War II.

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, man, I was a huge Dona War one fan.

242
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't really like what they did with Dona War II.

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm not going to lie.

244
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Wasn't a big Dona War II person.

245
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh my God.

246
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
All right, forgot another shotgun.

247
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Still pretty good.

248
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, thanks.

249
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Covered in the G.A.

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Roddy.

251
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm going to puke as I get.

252
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Derradi makes me puke.

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh my God.

254
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Derradi get out of here.

255
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Conqueror.

256
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Contrary.

257
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can't believe how many no points I got right there.

258
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh no, no.

259
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Damn it.

260
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I thought I had more rockets loaded.

261
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
SHIT.

262
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What does that spell shoot?

263
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Gosh darn it.

264
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, good.

265
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's what that spells.

266
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, boom.

267
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, boom.

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Who am I streaming with?

269
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
MLC stealth and italics.

270
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Two grows.

271
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We play games.

272
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Sometimes we are special.

273
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Sometimes we play video games.

274
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh, occasionally.

275
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Sometimes we laugh.

276
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Sometimes we cry.

277
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Sometimes we share valuable moments together.

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The nec is better.

279
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh, he's going to get away.

280
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I refuse to let him get away.

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He's going to get behind everybody.

282
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He's going to get behind us.

283
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, I think he already is.

284
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, he's gone.

285
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What?

286
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Nine health and I'm jumping off of high surfaces.

287
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, how I survived.

288
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Give me that health.

289
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Can you donate an unusual um?

290
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I thought you were about to say can you dig it, Sucker?

291
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I would rather you hang onto that.

292
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't need anything.

293
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You know, you don't have to get me stuff.

294
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Booker tea.

295
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Best surely an unusual because an unusual is worth a lot.

296
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And I don't want to take stuff like that from people so.

297
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh, did I make it?

298
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, my god.

299
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That was a good shot.

300
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That guy caught me right when I was coming down.

301
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, oh.

302
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I got to take off the conqueror.

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Conqueror is oh, man.

304
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Not feeling the conqueror.

305
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Not right now.

306
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh, damn.

307
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That was in the face.

308
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh.

309
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What's it?

310
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm taking this off.

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm going to put on.

312
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What am I going to put on?

313
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm going to put on the shotgun.

314
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The strange shotgun I still have to give these away.

315
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I have given my third.

316
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I've given 33% of the back back away so far.

317
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Two more people I have to get in contact with.

318
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And then after that, it is start all over again.

319
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
All right.

320
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm going medic.

321
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah, we could use, we only got one.

322
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Oh, actually, you are the one.

323
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You just went.

324
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Actually, there's two I think.

325
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Areas, medicing.

326
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, okay.

327
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay, okay.

328
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I see.

329
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So, which one is a German?

330
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I swear, it's not Dick Simmons, the dump champion.

331
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That is a spy.

332
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, no.

333
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If I see, oh, bye.

334
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Is it, is it, oh, bye, charge?

335
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What classes are you guys playing as right now?

336
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm soldier.

337
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, no.

338
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, so little hell.

339
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I am the same time.

340
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What do I have?

341
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Video settings on here.

342
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'll show you.

343
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm going to do that.

344
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm going to do that.

345
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm going to do that.

346
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll show you.

347
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Video, 1280 by 720, because I'm running in a window right now.

348
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm going to be able to stream it.

349
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But I play on high, high, high, simple, medium,

350
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
disabled color correction, and then all these other things.

351
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't play with anti-alasing on.

352
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I feel like the amount of resources it takes

353
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
to the amount of gain you get is not really that noticeable, at least in my opinion.

354
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Is it at least for a game like this?

355
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, my.

356
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you for putting me out of fire, Tyro.

357
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
For me, I always play with B-Sync God.

358
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh, my God.

359
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Damn.

360
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Always.

361
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm changing.

362
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm changing to engineer.

363
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Do I play any commonly hated games?

364
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, backstab.

365
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Turn around.

366
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Spy.

367
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Do you guys play any commonly hated games?

368
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Is outside our door?

369
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Any commonly hated cadence?

370
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I call it duty.

371
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What would fall under that?

372
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's fine.

373
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Number one right there.

374
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes, stealth.

375
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Answer it.

376
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yes.

377
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Stealth does play commonly hated games.

378
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Call it duty.

379
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But like actually hated like literally bad games, I don't know.

380
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah, I don't.

381
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't think I play any really hated games.

382
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh, there's the sniper again.

383
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
We still got to level one up.

384
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh, I think I got about a score.

385
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh, come on.

386
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Is this guy hacking?

387
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I see a spy on their team running around in his taunts.

388
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And he looks like a wax figure just moving around.

389
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Skating around.

390
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's probably a glitch or something.

391
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah, I saw that earlier too.

392
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think it is just a glitch.

393
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But even when he was disguised, it was just walking around.

394
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Not moving.

395
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Like arms in the air.

396
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, I got a change this.

397
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't got a change that one.

398
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I do.

399
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You got to change it.

400
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No, I got to hurry the hell up.

401
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, boy.

402
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Do you engineer?

403
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I was a second behind.

404
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I threw my games off, thrown off now.

405
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What is this like an RTS?

406
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I've got to catch up.

407
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
My actions permitted is only a hundred.

408
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's go.

409
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's go.

410
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What you gonna do?

411
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What's the best scattergun for the scout?

412
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,000
They're all good.

413
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Depends on how you play stylons.

414
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Mid-range, too long-range, use the shortstop.

415
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Close-range, meat shots, force nature, and everything else kind of in between.

416
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The regular scatterguns are probably the best.

417
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
At least that's kind of how I see it.

418
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I like that one the best.

419
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No, I gotta go over here.

420
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What am I doing?

421
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh god, I've already spurred this up.

422
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And I salvage this is the real question.

423
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's the real question.

424
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Can I salvage this?

425
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What am I doing?

426
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't know where I want to put it.

427
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I don't know what I want to do.

428
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm so torn right now.

429
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh, because this guy's right here now.

430
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm putting it right here.

431
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The limb of the limb of the...

432
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I was that was so torn.

433
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
My brain put it on here.

434
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I know what I was just doing right here.

435
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh, lord.

436
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh, this is going down in two seconds.

437
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I have absolutely...

438
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh, lag.

439
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh yeah, I got that too.

440
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Super lag.

441
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Is that the real emulsie stealth?

442
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I hope so.

443
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yep.

444
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh, I'm getting a lot of lag.

445
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Thank you, Engineer, for helping me build this.

446
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Appreciate it.

447
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And let's reload.

448
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Is that the real emulsie stealth?

449
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh yeah.

450
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
All right, I got some catching up to doing points.

451
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This is kind of getting embarrassing.

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh my gosh.

453
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Here comes...

454
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, there comes the dispenser.

455
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh my god.

456
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, he's up top.

457
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh.

458
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That just ruined my life.

459
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
There's my leg in.

460
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Unmoving.

461
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah, I got him.

462
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Or maybe you dead ring too, Nusk.

463
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We're going this.

464
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I like this better.

465
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Because I don't feel as bad when I lose all my stuff.

466
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh, spy.

467
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Doing his thing.

468
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I think that...

469
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, my word.

470
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He is doing his thing, isn't he?

471
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Get away, Romery.

472
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He's not dead.

473
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, he is not dead.

474
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I didn't get the...

475
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm going to duel with him right now.

476
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh, yeah.

477
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah, so I didn't get the...

478
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't know, everyone.

479
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Finally, on the cart.

480
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Shit.

481
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh, my god.

482
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You're all right, doc.

483
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh, run away.

484
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I want it up here.

485
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
They're about to get to the point.

486
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
They almost say...

487
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, crap thing.

488
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh, no, no, no, where's he?

489
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He's...

490
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, no.

491
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Give me the help.

492
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, my god, run away.

493
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh, this guy's still going to get me.

494
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, no.

495
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, I can't believe I'm still alive.

496
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Oh, they got it.

497
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
No, I was dead.

498
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I was toast right here.

499
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I was toast.

500
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh, I love butter toast.

501
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What's name tag?

502
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I think the chat...

503
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The chat freeze for anybody else.

504
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I think the chat froze for me.

505
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Somebody has found name tag.

506
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What's that mean?

507
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't think the chat froze.

508
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No, I was looking at it and I was like, wait, no, nothing.

509
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh, they're going to...

510
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
They got a heavy medic right here.

511
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Get rid of that medic.

512
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh, my god.

513
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
When all of us fails, just duck and cover.

514
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Well, I'll just fry.

515
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I didn't know you found that stuff though.

516
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Didn't know you found the name tags.

517
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I thought you had a biome.

518
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Ah, you can find it.

519
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,000
No, I think.

520
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,000
This one just found it.

521
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Frazier, you can find it.

522
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
There's spies surfing around in the base.

523
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There's two spies, I think sitting outside our doors.

524
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh, god, he's over here.

525
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
No, wait, what?

526
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's not even mine.

527
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's not my century.

528
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm really losing it here, guys.

529
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
My brain can't even handle what I'm doing.

530
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, get out of my way.

531
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
No, no, no, no.

532
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Oh, I just barely saved that.

533
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So many people.

534
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So much death.

535
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Trying to get this dispenser up.

536
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh, all those primes.

537
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I know you're not dead.

538
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You could just.

539
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Wow, oh, okay, I'm going out there.

540
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm going out there.

541
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm going out there.

542
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Someone's going to get toasted out there.

543
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh, it's probably going to be me.

544
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Is that you, Dick?

545
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Was that you?

546
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's just who walked right next to me?

547
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Was that the spy?

548
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Is that you, Richard?

549
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah, that's me.

550
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Oh, hello.

551
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What are you doing, Richard?

552
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah.

553
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh, get the medic.

554
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Oh, yeah, I went from like last place, like fourth place in one line.

555
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh, my God.

556
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh, my God.

557
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What's ringing out?

558
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh, that's a.

559
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I bet this is fun.

560
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I am.

561
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Wow.

562
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Hi.

563
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What happened?

564
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Hold on, hold on.

565
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That's going to be cool.

566
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's going to be cool.

567
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Sorry, let's talk to my man.

568
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm going to get back to that.

569
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's a spy.

570
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Oh, well, shoot.

571
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,000
God.

572
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, God.

573
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,000
There we go.

574
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
This is what I'm talking about.

575
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Ow.

576
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What the fuck?

577
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm with a scoreboard, boys.

578
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I have faith in you, Jerma.

579
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I wonder if I will play, you think, uh,

580
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I read it.

581
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I wonder if you're going to nice to.

582
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What the hell was that?

583
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What the hell was that?

584
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Just get a nice gun in place when at the end of that hallway right there.

585
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah, I'm trying to, I can turn it.

586
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Did I keep destroying it?

587
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I got some people that know I get doing.

588
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Uh, I've probably will play zombie fortress at some point.

589
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Probably not tonight though.

590
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What?

591
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Zombie fortress.

592
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm just going into punches.

593
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't even care.

594
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
We might knock it out with one punch.

595
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You're getting knocked out from the, uh,

596
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
oh, come on, feel the pain.

597
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Feel it.

598
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I would have killed them too.

599
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Oh, fuck, let's try.

600
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Let's get one shot.

601
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Uh, let's set the next level to where we're going.

602
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
We're changing server after this anyway, so.

603
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh,

604
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
all right.

605
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Well, that answers that question.

606
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We're changing server.

607
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Just a people want to know,

608
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
German, what is zombie fortress?

609
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I, uh, I don't know.

610
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I think it's like kind of like every, oh my god.

611
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Everybody plays as, oh, I think everyone has melee,

612
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
except for a small group of people.

613
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Somebody explain it.

614
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Oh, so it's like infection on Halo.

615
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Hey, you're not me.

616
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Whatever that game mode is called.

617
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I think I know what you're talking about.

618
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah, it's, it's like, it's kind of like a zombie mode,

619
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
where everyone runs around with melee,

620
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
except for the small group of people that don't have,

621
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
did they're like the not zombies.

622
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
If I'm wrong, somebody please correct me in the chat,

623
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
because I know it's something like that though.

624
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That's probably right.

625
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Somebody said it's like Halo infection.

626
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Watch out for spies.

627
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Oh, they got taken out everything.

628
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I got to be a little bit sneakier with these centers.

629
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And that's going to blow up again.

630
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And that's going to die.

631
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I said, all right.

632
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I go, I'm going to go.

633
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm going to S sounds.

634
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Who you playing as heavy?

635
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I am playing as heavy.

636
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
See, Scout is what I rage quit as.

637
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Five, I like to run around.

638
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I start a scout and then I'm like, oh, okay, I suck.

639
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Moving on to the heavy where I can actually kill people.

640
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I like this setup.

641
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'll stick with this.

642
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Whoa, I heard it backstabbed.

643
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm standing in the corner.

644
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh, God.

645
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Oh, I don't think he's dead.

646
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Maybe he is.

647
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I don't know.

648
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Man, we don't have any engineers do we?

649
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh, my.

650
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Wait, what just happened to me?

651
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What just even happened?

652
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I got headshot from across the map.

653
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh, my God.

654
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh, no, I just struck this.

655
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
We're about to lose.

656
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
We're about to lose.

657
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah, there's two spies on the point.

658
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh, the car.

659
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
We lost.

660
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
What are you guys going to get like a set of spies?

661
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
How many spies are on that damn team?

662
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
All right, new new server.

663
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Not GG.

664
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
New S-E-V-R-V-V-R-V.

665
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Let's go to...

666
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Hmm, actually, hold on.

667
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm going to...

668
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
The screen's going to go black for one second.

669
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Because I'm going to change...

670
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Let me change something real quick.

671
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
While you do that, I'll be RB for about 10 seconds.

672
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm going to see what my guys want.

673
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Well, because for some reason, when I was doing

674
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
X-Fly in the game mode, it was lagging my game a lot.

675
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't know why.

676
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Sometimes I guess it does that.

677
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm going to get a little bit of a bit of a lag.

678
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm going to get a little bit of a lag.

679
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm going to get a little bit of a lag.

680
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm going to get a little bit of a lag.

681
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah, are you using like the...

682
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
What?

683
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Screen area or the other one?

684
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I was doing the game source.

685
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,000
When the game...

686
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
That was like lagging my game sort of.

687
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
All right, try a screen area.

688
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I just did not change it over.

689
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Explore it.

690
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You're supposed to be like the release.

691
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
All right, let's go to...

692
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Go to the top.

693
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
To me some things too.

694
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You're going to the top.

695
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Oh no, go to high tower.

696
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
High tower zero out of...

697
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
This is a good one.

698
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Hopefully stealth gets back soon.

699
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Otherwise he's going to be in trouble.

700
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
To delay for him when we were doing the test streaming.

701
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I was using game source and it was working fine.

702
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So it just seems like on again, off again.

703
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Let's hit her miss now.

704
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Very hit her miss now.

705
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,000
All right, that's all I got.

706
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Still, still I got.

707
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,000
That's it.

708
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
That's your only...

709
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That's my only delay.

710
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
All right.

711
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Stealth.

712
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You better hurry up.

713
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Oh, eight.

714
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It's so jama how things going over here today.

715
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Here we go.

716
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm pasting it.

717
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Already got video and a stream.

718
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Just ballin.

719
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Like a YouTuber does.

720
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Ballin.

721
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Straight ballin.

722
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
All right, stealth.

723
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Really, that's all I got.

724
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Now, now we're never meant.

725
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
All right, 68.

726
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Dot 232.

727
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Dot 177.

728
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Dot 105.

729
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Colin 270.

730
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,000
15.

731
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Sorry, stealth.

732
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You weren't here.

733
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
But you missed out.

734
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's the IP.

735
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That does be a wondering.

736
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
All right.

737
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I hear somebody like here.

738
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You're not gonna pick up.

739
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, he's it.

740
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
He's no, he's not making it.

741
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
There's no way he makes it.

742
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
All right, hey, there's no way you make it.

743
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
There's no way he makes it.

744
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I was gonna say I have some bad news.

745
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Bears.

746
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Dinner is ready with my parents.

747
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I always probably go.

748
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Dinner is.

749
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Sir,

750
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
put on like,

751
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
throw me out of the sun.

752
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
All right, well, yeah,

753
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,000
see you later, dude.

754
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Thanks for coming.

755
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Do you have no problem?

756
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh, still, I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

757
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Make sure you signify to this frame.

758
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Is that gonna miss you?

759
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh, by screen.

760
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Two.

761
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Thanks for, uh, having me.

762
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And I'll see you guys later.

763
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
All right, miss you guys.

764
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Oh, I'm the host of the call.

765
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'll just meet myself.

766
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Oh, are you really?

767
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Yeah, just mute your, uh,

768
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
all right?

769
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah, now, now who should have hosted?

770
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Burbey.

771
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah, I know.

772
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Well, the good thing I missed that,

773
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
so I can do it again and miss it again.

774
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I will play until you decide that you want to play a CS go.

775
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Then I will bow out as well.

776
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Yeah, thanks for sticking around it.

777
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Tell my wife, I said hello.

778
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Hello, wife.

779
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
What?

780
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What?

781
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,000
On the stream?

782
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Was that a stream comment?

783
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah, I guess.

784
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Why, Stealth, why?

785
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Stealth, how could you be so inconsiderate?

786
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Wow.

787
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Oh, there's a lot of spice.

788
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Now, I just want to flying 100 feet in the air.

789
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That's off to the spryme.

790
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
He doesn't mess around.

791
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm running away.

792
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm running into spawn.

793
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You can't get me a spawn.

794
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Sorry.

795
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Text message.

796
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Do you ever have a problem where like you hit Am or something

797
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
to change your loadout and then it opens like the options menu?

798
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It does that sometimes, yeah.

799
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Just curious.

800
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That is an issue and now I'm going to die right here.

801
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That is an issue, so I should get a tissue.

802
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You know what?

803
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm going to go straight up.

804
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's my fault.

805
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,000
No.

806
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Yes.

807
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm trying, Piro, but I'm not having a great luck right now.

808
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Oh my god.

809
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
What is going on with the avatars?

810
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What the hell is going on?

811
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Why is everybody like a pony?

812
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Wait, what?

813
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Hold down tab for a second here.

814
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah.

815
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Is every single avatar a pony for you?

816
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
No.

817
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Oh my god.

818
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I can see mine in yours.

819
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Why?

820
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,000
What?

821
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah, that's all I can see.

822
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Well, that's a...

823
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I have no idea.

824
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Everyone else in the street can see yours though.

825
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I guess that's good.

826
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Man, no one has pushed our cart past the like spawn area here.

827
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I cannot even hit this person.

828
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There we go.

829
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
We were getting absolutely dominated.

830
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
They're already going up the track.

831
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Where's this pyro?

832
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh my god, I'm doing so awful.

833
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Oh my goodness.

834
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
No, medic stay alive.

835
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Stay alive.

836
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Medic.

837
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Medic.

838
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
All right, let's get on this cart.

839
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Let's do this.

840
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
All right, for some reason no one ever wants to go heavy.

841
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I guess we can get back stabbed all the time.

842
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Does that cart really all the way over there?

843
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Oh my god.

844
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Come on, come at me.

845
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Do you have the cart all the way at that last point?

846
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Are you kidding me?

847
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Holy crap.

848
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah, that was kind of what I was thinking.

849
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
How the hell did they get that there?

850
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
How the hell did they get there?

851
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh, I'm hearing my stream.

852
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh, I have to turn this off.

853
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Whoops.

854
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah, that's...

855
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Wow.

856
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Blue team.

857
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Bravo.

858
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,000
My god.

859
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Look at this insanity going on here.

860
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,000
What is...

861
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Wow.

862
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
There was a spy idling in a corner and we were sitting there

863
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
like pummeling him for about 10 seconds.

864
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I think I'm gonna must have two scouts on the cart.

865
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Get them.

866
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Get them.

867
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Oh, come on.

868
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
That's it.

869
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We lost.

870
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
That is game over right there.

871
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I can't.

872
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I can't get them.

873
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Oh, no.

874
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's not game over.

875
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Oh, what do I do?

876
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What do I do?

877
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Heavy.

878
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,000
What do I do?

879
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Let's push the car people.

880
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You know what I've got?

881
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Get on that, got.

882
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
All right, I am as paranoid as you could possibly be right now.

883
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And you know what?

884
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I was literally...

885
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I was turning around to check first by behind me and he got me.

886
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Like, my brain was telling my mouse to do that

887
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and like I got back to that.

888
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
That's why I went pyro.

889
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm just like spraying everywhere.

890
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm just watching you do that.

891
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
All right.

892
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Paranoid.

893
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
What's up, guys?

894
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You know, I'm just gonna be...

895
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And again, with the spy, even though I'm a pyro,

896
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I've come back to have again.

897
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh my God, people are just everywhere.

898
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I love their message.

899
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Oh, they're gonna get it.

900
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,000
They're gonna get it.

901
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000
All right.

902
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Turn away when you play.

903
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That's right now.

904
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You're playing as a...

905
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Heavy.

906
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh, where were we?

907
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Six shot.

908
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Six shot.

909
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Whoever that was.

910
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That got that scout off.

911
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,000
German.

912
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Do you love me?

913
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Do you love me?

914
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Do you love me?

915
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Do you love me?

916
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Now that I can't dance.

917
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That's a song, right?

918
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yeah?

919
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah?

920
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I would sing it in the shower.

921
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Sure.

922
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Let's do it.

923
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm not gonna do the uncrediting tonight.

924
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm gonna be doing...

925
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
That's gonna be in a live calm, just a straight-up video.

926
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Probably next week.

927
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You...

928
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Get out of here.

929
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You're not dead.

930
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I know you're not dead.

931
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm jumping away.

932
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm getting it.

933
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeah, get away from me.

934
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I need help.

935
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Oh, do I get help?

936
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Or do I spot-check everybody in my team?

937
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Whatever works.

938
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I see you up here, Spy.

939
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You little sniper.

940
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You crazy little sniper.

941
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yep.

942
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Nice try on your stair step, but it didn't work.

943
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Did it?

944
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
No, that was not Spy.

945
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That got...

946
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Oh, God!

947
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Where's the other guy?

948
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Oh, my God.

949
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Oh, my God!

950
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Where is the other guy?

951
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
No more heavy.

952
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm gonna go...

953
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Heavy.

954
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm staying heavy.

955
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Up there all on the-

956
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
They're all on the carto-

957
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Uh, this is me, Robo.

958
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh, my God.

959
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Is that Pyro?

960
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I just went to a side Pyro on them.

961
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I got at least one, I think.

962
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I gotta eat this so I can run fast.

963
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh, they're going.

964
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
They're almost there.

965
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
They're gonna get it.

966
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So that means I can run away, because I just took this-

967
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
There's three people on it?

968
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh, they're definitely gonna get it.

969
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Yeah, see how fast I'm running?

970
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You won't get the satisfaction of killing me.

971
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Actually, he kind of did.

972
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
He kind of did get the satisfaction of killing me.

973
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Too late.

974
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I am bit-

975
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,000
No, I have to-

976
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Oh, do I go medic?

977
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I-

978
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm gonna wreck sniper.

979
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm still too paranoid, man.

980
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm just like-

981
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm spraying inside the spawn area.

982
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
That's how paranoid I am.

983
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Now that's paranoid for you.

984
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I know, they all blew up.

985
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You are R-S-5.

986
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Are you not?

987
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Apparently I am dueling.

988
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Damn.

989
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Oh, what-

990
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I-

991
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I don't even know what just happened.

992
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I was like checking around too.

993
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm going medic.

994
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's the best thing to do right now.

995
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

996
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Spy?

997
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm just gonna go kill bot medic.

998
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And I can make sure everyone stays alive.

999
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'm gonna have my back turn the entire time.

1000
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Do it, man.

1001
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The entire time.

1002
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,000
We have like-

1003
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Oh, we have two pirates on the team right now.

1004
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
We have like three earlier.

1005
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
People were just so paranoid.

1006
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Oh, you get-

1007
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Get caught up here.

1008
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Oh, god.

1009
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And there's another spy.

1010
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,000
God, run away.

1011
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Help me, somebody help me.

1012
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Stay safe.

1013
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Stay close to the blue red.

1014
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I can't live it and hit him.

1015
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh, he's gonna kill me.

1016
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Oh, my god, I'm a lucky son of a bitch.

1017
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm-

1018
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I gotta run away.

1019
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm- I am on.

1020
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,000
What do you say, honey?

1021
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
What do you say?

1022
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Oh, shit.

1023
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Oh, no.

1024
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I didn't want to do that.

1025
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Oh, god, no.

1026
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I just like trade over somebody.

1027
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Dude, no one is pushing our cart, including myself.

1028
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Oh, I'm gonna love a god.

1029
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It's still like right there.

1030
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
He's still right there.

1031
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Right there, it's fun, man.

1032
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Actually, to be quite honest with you,

1033
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
that was the most success I've had all game.

1034
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It's with that medic.

1035
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And I- and I healed like two people.

1036
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Medic.

1037
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Alright, I'll get another medic.

1038
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Medic.

1039
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Stop.

1040
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Ah.

1041
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Ah, still a side medic.

1042
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Oh, this guy is toast.

1043
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh, one more guy behind me.

1044
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh, no, no, no.

1045
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Oh, you, huh?

1046
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
How many spies are on their team?

1047
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Just the count.

1048
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It's gotta be at least three.

1049
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It's gotta be.

1050
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
If it's not, then I'm wrong.

1051
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I need to, you know what?

1052
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Take up the crit screen.

1053
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Quick fix.

1054
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Quick fix.

1055
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
No trades.

1056
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I don't take the trades right now.

1057
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That was a terrible scar.

1058
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So that was supposed to be a Scottish accent,

1059
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
guys. How terrible was that?

1060
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That's a spy.

1061
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I am certain of this.

1062
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
No, I guess I'm wrong.

1063
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Oh, barely got me.

1064
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And I'm like getting people killed

1065
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
because I'm checking this.

1066
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Did I just heal this by?

1067
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
No, I didn't.

1068
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
No way.

1069
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Dude, we've got four pyros on our team now.

1070
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
The people they are listening, they're like,

1071
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
enough of this nonsense.

1072
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
We have like getting shot from.

1073
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I don't even know where they're coming from.

1074
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It's almost like they're coming out of our spawn.

1075
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm going pyro on easy mode right here.

1076
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I've got like the back burner,

1077
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
so I don't even have to think.

1078
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Just like spray.

1079
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm trying to use the, uh, the quick fix.

1080
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You know, I'm going to heal you.

1081
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
We're just going to run like the dickens.

1082
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Uh-oh.

1083
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Run away.

1084
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Look at all the, what?

1085
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Those are all spies.

1086
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
At least, oh my god, this is the worst thing ever.

1087
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Oh my god, chaos.

1088
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Run.

1089
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh my god, dude.

1090
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
They keep running into like the same heavy.

1091
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm put, I got a, I'm playing spy.

1092
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We are trapped in this spawn area right now.

1093
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Where are you coming out from?

1094
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Left, right or center?

1095
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I keep going out because I'm a medic, so I'm trying to guard the middle.

1096
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
God, somebody just killed me so I can just get a back stab and feel good about myself.

1097
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Look at this, look at this K-O.

1098
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You got to be S, I can't even say it.

1099
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm so upset.

1100
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
All right, let's make, let's make some statues.

1101
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Oh, oh, my, I'm on like your team.

1102
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Oh, great.

1103
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Now he knows I'm a spy.

1104
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Oh, geez.

1105
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Oh, my, I'm, I'm, I can't get out of spawn either, man.

1106
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm just using the enforcer to kill people.

1107
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I can't.

1108
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
As soon as I said there were four pyros, everyone switched back on our team.

1109
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Oh, get a little, there's, oh, man, I got blasted right there.

1110
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
All right, after this, we're going to another server.

1111
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Because we need to scramble these teams.

1112
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
They've got a century gun right next to our cart.

1113
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Really?

1114
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
That's not cool.

1115
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Hey, you know what's the note I'll say?

1116
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Oh, what do you have?

1117
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
What you got?

1118
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,000
No.

1119
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And they're already winning again.

1120
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Oh, God, no, no, please, no.

1121
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
All these ponies.

1122
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You know what, when all else fails, you just go.

1123
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Pretty sure there's at least two people idling.

1124
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Well, at least when all else fails, you go straight up, Demonite.

1125
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And if that don't work, I just speaking of the Monite.

1126
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Morgan.

1127
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And that's what I just went.

1128
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
All right, like right before you said that.

1129
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh, my God.

1130
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I saw that.

1131
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I just charged out of spawn and I flew like 5,000 people.

1132
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Come on, Lazz.

1133
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Come on, Lazz.

1134
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Get him.

1135
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Get him.

1136
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It's all up to you.

1137
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And he did it.

1138
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,000
He's a champion.

1139
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
All right, this is going to be a spire right here.

1140
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Get out of town.

1141
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I got one of the spites.

1142
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Oh, no, no, no, server change.

1143
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It's time to change servers.

1144
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Let's go to, I want to go two weeks.

1145
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
A server we can win on.

1146
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Well, I'm just kidding.

1147
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I want to go to my server.

1148
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I want to go to a bold rush.

1149
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Sounds good.

1150
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Are you ready?

1151
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Yes.

1152
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
So, the what's going on here?

1153
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
72.9.

1154
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Dot 146.

1155
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Dot 118.

1156
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Call on 27015.

1157
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Go.

1158
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
You almost lost me on the colon, but I think I got it.

1159
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Colon 27015.

1160
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
27015.

1161
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
What's the password?

1162
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
What's the password?

1163
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
That's a pretty easy password.

1164
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So, deal with it.

1165
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Yeah, I mean, my YouTube password was 1, 2, 3 for a long time.

1166
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm just kidding.

1167
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It told me I had to change it.

1168
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Oh, I got dropped due to the server.

1169
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
What?

1170
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
We went in there first.

1171
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
How is that possible?

1172
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Okay.

1173
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Sorry, those are new.

1174
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
How is that making sense?

1175
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
We were on our way in before I.

1176
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
In the game.

1177
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Well, I apologize to those of you that just got into that server, but we have to change.

1178
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So, 98.158.

1179
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Dot 87.226.

1180
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Colon 27040.

1181
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
All right, now I'm going to wait a second before I give the sound.

1182
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Well, if they're probably listening.

1183
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Yeah, but it's like a 10 second.

1184
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,000
A little.

1185
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah, but still.

1186
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
There's somebody out there with this ridiculous internet speeds.

1187
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Yeah, and I can just, I can just come right in.

1188
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Pipeline payload.

1189
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Yes, strange.

1190
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Angel, I think this is a talix playing.

1191
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You are correct.

1192
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Hey, guys, hey, strange love.

1193
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
How's it going?

1194
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So, this is the server.

1195
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Wait, did that?

1196
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
What? Wait, hold on a second.

1197
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Did that already fill up?

1198
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
We already fold.

1199
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I didn't.

1200
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Oh, somebody else put it in.

1201
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Okay, thank you to whoever put that in.

1202
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Thank you.

1203
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I appreciate it.

1204
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I thought you didn't join.

1205
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
That's what I thought at first.

1206
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Oh, God.

1207
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
This is like a jellyfish server.

1208
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Like the screen is motor like a jellyfish for me right now.

1209
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Look at how laggy everybody is.

1210
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Look at this.

1211
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I feel like it's like.

1212
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Oh, my God.

1213
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Look at this claymation server.

1214
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Look at that.

1215
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Let me see.

1216
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Well, uh,

1217
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
oh, look at the pings.

1218
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
My goodness gracious.

1219
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Everyone except for me and you is like,

1220
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
a hundred plus.

1221
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It really looks like a stop motion animation.

1222
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I feel now.

1223
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I'm like,

1224
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I feel like I'm playing at 20 frames per second.

1225
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,000
But I'm not.

1226
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But I'm not.

1227
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.

1228
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Look, we got to change again because this is just bad.

1229
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
All right.

1230
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
This is not this is not against the people who are here.

1231
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
This is one of the people who didn't get in.

1232
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Yeah, it's right.

1233
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It tells you you can look at the stream and see what I see right now.

1234
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It is like, it is pretty much like I'm watching a cartoon on drugs.

1235
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
All right.

1236
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Well, yeah, it looks like nobody could even get into this one.

1237
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
There was only seven on eight.

1238
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I apologize.

1239
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I sorry.

1240
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
New server.

1241
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Take three.

1242
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yeah, third time's a charm.

1243
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Third time.

1244
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,000
How one?

1245
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Ah, two.

1246
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Ah, three crunch.

1247
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So why do I get my third time?

1248
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I'm probably going to get a 32 person server.

1249
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm going to hope I can.

1250
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But wait, wait till I get that server.

1251
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
We'll be okay.

1252
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I want to server all the cool kids.

1253
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Half one.

1254
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,000
All right.

1255
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Here we go.

1256
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
66.55.154.

1257
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Don't two, three, four.

1258
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Call in 27015.

1259
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And we paste this in.

1260
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And a second once we get in.

1261
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I do apologize that we have to do this twice.

1262
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And that was the third time.

1263
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Hopefully this one is going to be the good one.

1264
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
They pasted it in already.

1265
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You did really?

1266
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I told you it was like literally two seconds after you said it.

1267
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I saw it pop up in the chat.

1268
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You guys are fast.

1269
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Lightning fast, even.

1270
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
You might say.

1271
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
You can say that.

1272
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Oh.

1273
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I am going demo night.

1274
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Gamer night.

1275
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Actually found.

1276
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Oh, sorry.

1277
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,000
What?

1278
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I said demo.

1279
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And I was just re-language.

1280
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I actually found a salt and ceremonial the other day.

1281
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh.

1282
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I was very happy about that.

1283
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Very cool.

1284
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
So now I can have a legit demo night if I wanted to give up my grenade launcher.

1285
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It's a tough call for the for the booties.

1286
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yeah.

1287
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
booties.

1288
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And then we got Stimidae here.

1289
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
With his wicked sick hat.

1290
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So I have to do this right now because somebody keeps sending me a very inappropriate

1291
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
messenger.

1292
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And hopefully that stops that from happening.

1293
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I don't think it will, but I at least tried.

1294
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Oh.

1295
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Okay.

1296
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
All right.

1297
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
We got a full servanon.

1298
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Good to go.

1299
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Let's go.

1300
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Come back now.

1301
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Just in time.

1302
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Everyone is off the real way.

1303
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Like everyone.

1304
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Oh, so over at the same time.

1305
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Oh my god.

1306
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You just totally predicted where I was going to shoot.

1307
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Shotgun soldier.

1308
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Shotgun soldier.

1309
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Oh my god.

1310
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Did you see that?

1311
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Yeah.

1312
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Yeah.

1313
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I've loved him a night.

1314
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yeah, I have only so far given one third.

1315
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I'm still waiting on two people.

1316
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So eventually I will be giving 100 percent.

1317
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
But I have to wait for the other two people to get back to me.

1318
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Oh.

1319
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That hurts.

1320
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Oh, dear.

1321
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I made quite a mess.

1322
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Someone on the team was announcing how many spies they have.

1323
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
They have four, apparently.

1324
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I want a good traitor.

1325
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,000
He is.

1326
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
How ironic is that?

1327
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So he's a double spy.

1328
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Yeah.

1329
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
So he's telling us about spies.

1330
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So he's spying on the spies for his own spies.

1331
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
As someone in the comments will undoubtedly say,

1332
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
spy section.

1333
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Yep.

1334
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
That is absolutely what it is.

1335
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Not far from this.

1336
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Maybe he's why.

1337
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Why?

1338
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Hmm, or suspicious.

1339
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh.

1340
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Maybe he's a triple spy.

1341
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
He said, I served no one.

1342
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
DTA, don't trust anyone.

1343
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Like, I like your attitude.

1344
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And that's his fine.

1345
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
He's his dire.

1346
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
He's going to get ugly.

1347
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And he's going to try and stare stabbing.

1348
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I already know this.

1349
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I've been around the block a few times.

1350
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You know what?

1351
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You, I know.

1352
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I'm going to stand right here.

1353
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
You're going to have to go that way.

1354
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Oh god.

1355
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Oh no.

1356
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Oh.

1357
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Oh.

1358
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Let's see where.

1359
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
On the old until I get the gets flubbered pyro going down here.

1360
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Oh my god.

1361
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Oh my god.

1362
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Well, you just die of pyro.

1363
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
What am I doing?

1364
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Oh, they're almost there, man.

1365
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
They're right at the edge with seven minutes and 40 seconds to go.

1366
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
We can do this.

1367
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,000
We can do this.

1368
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Oh, come on.

1369
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I would have had it.

1370
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I would have had it.

1371
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I would have had it.

1372
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I was being sarcastic, by the way.

1373
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I had no faith.

1374
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I don't even know if that's how you spell it,

1375
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
but that's what I'm doing.

1376
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I love how the highest score,

1377
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
scoring player on our team is four points and was like a four way tie for four.

1378
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Me included.

1379
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Yeah, yeah, four, four, four, four, four, three.

1380
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Boom.

1381
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Auto scrambling the teams.

1382
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Well, that's one way to do it.

1383
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Whoa.

1384
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
All right.

1385
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So this is a goodbye.

1386
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Wait.

1387
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Oh, you changed your name to new.

1388
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Yeah, I did.

1389
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Did you guess who I am?

1390
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Well, I'm not hard.

1391
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Yes, because I can see your icon.

1392
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Henderson in corporate.

1393
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
We sell carpets and we do floor finishing.

1394
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Where do you come up with your name?

1395
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So you just look at something and say, okay, I'm going to take that.

1396
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Kind of.

1397
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
It's just whatever is in my brain at that particular second is what it is.

1398
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Oh, I tried to high five you.

1399
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So this is going to be the last round of TF2 and then I'm going to move on to CS.

1400
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Go for a little bit.

1401
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I got to make a count then.

1402
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh, then you have it, right?

1403
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I don't have CS go.

1404
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,000
That's what I was saying.

1405
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I'm going to have to bow out when you switch games.

1406
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Let's go.

1407
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I mean, we've been playing for about an hour or something.

1408
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Still, still has it, but he.

1409
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Yeah, he's, I mean, if you need to the eat, I mean,

1410
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
he's eating macaroni and cheese and like dog food, whatever he eats.

1411
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Dude, don't you make me hungry, man?

1412
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
macaroni cheese and dog food.

1413
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Come on.

1414
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Oh, that's delicacy.

1415
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Watch out, Uber.

1416
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Right up the door.

1417
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Oh my god, that guy just killed every single person in here.

1418
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So stealth must be watching the stream.

1419
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Why is he responding?

1420
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I don't know.

1421
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Scrains love just said he's here.

1422
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
He's in here.

1423
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Oh.

1424
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Oh my god.

1425
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
He's eating a lot to nit at the tape at this parents.

1426
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Imagine he just has like his laptop out.

1427
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I should have done the buff banner.

1428
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I really should have.

1429
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I gotta get killed at the medic.

1430
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Oh, man.

1431
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I can't talk about.

1432
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Oh, that would have been cool if I had that go off.

1433
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Just get the telephone in the telecaribou.

1434
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You should be on the winning team now, maybe.

1435
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Don't hit my medic, you bastards.

1436
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I can't believe they haven't turned around.

1437
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
How?

1438
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I just did two crits and I'm hitting my own teammate.

1439
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
What the hell is going on?

1440
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Dude, I just planted it like six hits into this guy.

1441
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Holy crap.

1442
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
That was ridiculous.

1443
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I've never seen that happen before.

1444
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Both hammering on the same guy.

1445
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Oh, guys.

1446
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Are we got a crit screen now?

1447
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
We got a crit screen now.

1448
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Oh, man.

1449
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Oh, there's four demo man on demo men.

1450
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I think no wonder.

1451
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I just like saved that demo man's life.

1452
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
But not really.

1453
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
All right, push it.

1454
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Push it.

1455
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Oh, push it.

1456
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,000
No.

1457
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
No.

1458
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
This is a really bad idea.

1459
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I just ran around to spawn.

1460
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Maybe not.

1461
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Come on.

1462
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Come on.

1463
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Oh, come on.

1464
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
That is a sad face indeed.

1465
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That is a sad face indeed.

1466
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Couldn't have had an explosion kill.

1467
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Couldn't have what a shut up.

1468
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
What it didn't have.

1469
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
That's a weird idea.

1470
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm trying my hand.

1471
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh, you guys are about to win.

1472
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
You got like three pyros back here.

1473
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Just camping our spawn hard core.

1474
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Really?

1475
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Oh, man.

1476
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Never run.

1477
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Yeah.

1478
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Cool.

1479
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Let's do some crazy rocket jumps.

1480
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Here we come.

1481
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Rocket jump.

1482
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I think I got like one kill.

1483
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Dude, I've been doing I've been doing jump maps.

1484
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:31,000
See we go.

1485
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I did some jump.

1486
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I know what I'm doing.

1487
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
All right.

1488
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Somebody in the street said,

1489
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Jerma plays, play tribes of Synth.

1490
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
That's what they said.

1491
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I'm not making that up.

1492
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Um, I see.

1493
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I see.

1494
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I see people say that.

1495
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
But CSGO just had a big,

1496
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
huge crazy update.

1497
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I want to check that out.

1498
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Five.

1499
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
But to answer your questions in the comments,

1500
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
tribes of Synth is free to play.

1501
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
So it is.

1502
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And it's now totally open.

1503
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It's not in beta anymore.

1504
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
It is out now.

1505
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah, it's out.

1506
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's been released.

1507
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
It is fun.

1508
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So that's, uh, I'm going to move on from TF2 now.

1509
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Played upon an hour of TF2.

1510
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So before I go, I have to do something good.

1511
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I have to do something just stupid.

1512
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And just TF2.

1513
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Here we go.

1514
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Let's go, uh, place five.

1515
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And I'm going to just,

1516
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
this is this is the goal here, guys.

1517
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
The goal is to try

1518
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
and blend in with the other team.

1519
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
So it's going to be hard to people are watching the stream.

1520
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
But this could be interesting.

1521
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I want to try doing this at least once.

1522
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Why is there a floating scout stuff here?

1523
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Oh no, I'm just the high five.

1524
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
So the, the goal here is to try and blend in.

1525
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Let's see how well I do.

1526
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Let's see how well I do here.

1527
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
All right, we're going to stop them.

1528
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Come on, get them.

1529
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Come on.

1530
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Oh my god, they're coming.

1531
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
The car is upside down.

1532
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
What the hell is going on with that car?

1533
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It is a thing.

1534
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Come on, we must get them.

1535
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,000
All right.

1536
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Oh no, here they come.

1537
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
They're coming out of the right door now.

1538
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Blue team.

1539
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
That's, no.

1540
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I'm going to, oh, you figure me out.

1541
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
That guy, no, he didn't see me.

1542
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Okay, I just got to build my stuff right here.

1543
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Just got to build some stuff.

1544
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I'm trying to build my, uh,

1545
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
my teleporter, my century, and it's all good stuff.

1546
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Let me just, uh, build that up.

1547
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Thank you for the overhealed by the way.

1548
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Oh, I'm a fake.

1549
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Oh god.

1550
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
It's got, uh, I got you.

1551
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Oh, my god.

1552
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Oh, I'm going to get back to my post.

1553
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
These bastards, they ruined everything.

1554
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
No, please don't take it.

1555
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Oh my god, I got, I got to get back to my century.

1556
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
We're going to, I got to build my century.

1557
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Oh, that is, that's me right there.

1558
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Okay, cool.

1559
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Uh, sniper.

1560
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And there we go.

1561
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I'm going to snipe.

1562
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
All right, let me get back to my sniping post.

1563
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
All right, here we go.

1564
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Just sniping.

1565
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Now the enemy team is coming out here.

1566
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Watch out guys.

1567
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Be careful.

1568
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Now, let me snipe with you.

1569
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Oh god.

1570
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Who's the real one?

1571
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
We're standing right next to each other.

1572
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Oh, you got me.

1573
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Shit.

1574
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Oh, you ruined my fun.

1575
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
That's what I get angry and die.

1576
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Oh, all right, that's, uh, that's going to be actually,

1577
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I'll run the round out.

1578
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Why not?

1579
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Why not?

1580
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's disguised as an enemy sniper.

1581
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
That's the best way to do it.

1582
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And then just sit in the corner and be like, oh, I'm sniping.

1583
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Oh, I'm going to get the three hits.

1584
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Uh, crit with the gun slinger.

1585
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Almost got it.

1586
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Uh, it's really satisfying.

1587
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Oh, damn it.

1588
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Oh, he didn't get me.

1589
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Uh-huh.

1590
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Uh-huh.

1591
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Uh-huh.

1592
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Oh, come on.

1593
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Come on.

1594
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
No.

1595
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
No.

1596
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Okay, good, good, good.

1597
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
All right, let me get my sniping skills.

1598
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I found an ambassador.

1599
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I still haven't had a sniper.

1600
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I'm going to get a sniper.

1601
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I'm going to get a sniper.

1602
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I'm going to get a sniper.

1603
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I'm going to get a sniper.

1604
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I still haven't been fortunate.

1605
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Really difficult.

1606
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Oh, come on.

1607
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I'm just trying to snipe.

1608
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
All right, if you guys don't sub spam and chat

1609
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
a most or block in some people.

1610
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
No, they got it.

1611
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
They found me out again.

1612
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Oh, we get the wrath of the mod coming down.

1613
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Uh-huh.

1614
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
All right, this is my last life.

1615
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Then I'm moving on to uh-

1616
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
counter-

1617
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Stephenson.

1618
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Great opportunity.

1619
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Backstab.

1620
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I'm going to tell you how-

1621
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
yeah, I'm taking the teleporter as a spy.

1622
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
At level two, I'm a real bad bastard.

1623
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I'm a real bastard.

1624
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Look at this.

1625
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Level two teleporter.

1626
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And I'm taking it as a spy.

1627
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
What a jerk.

1628
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I wonder if I can uh-

1629
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
just kill people up from up here.

1630
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Oh, for the love of God.

1631
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I just can't get the melee.

1632
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Oh.

1633
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Oh.

1634
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Well, that's the last one.

1635
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
That's the worst engineer ever.

1636
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
How come I can't spray my spray?

1637
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
That's not cool.

1638
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Yeah, I don't have a spray.

1639
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I need to- I need a cool one.

1640
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I am going to change to saw CS go.

1641
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
After I swing it this guy over and over again.

1642
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Oh, oh.

1643
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
So always one more life.

1644
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Yeah, this is really the last life.

1645
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I'm not- this is not a joke.

1646
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
No more- no jokes.

1647
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
This is the last one.

1648
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Yeah.

1649
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I have to backstab at least one person.

1650
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
And that's not the guy apparently.

1651
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And that's not the guy either.

1652
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
It's going to be not that guy.

1653
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
It's what's- what's- what's-

1654
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Now I can't backstab anybody.

1655
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Oh, my no's will pretend.

1656
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Oh, let me do that pretender I am.

1657
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Come on, get that knife out.

1658
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Oh, my God.

1659
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Well,

1660
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
that's the end for me.

1661
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Oh, thanks for playing guys.

1662
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Tf2.

1663
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I'm going to move on to some-

1664
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Yep, it's a go-go.

1665
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
You're full-on.

1666
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's a fun losing every round.

1667
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I'm the only comment denominator here,

1668
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
so I take full responsibility for that.

1669
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I've been on every losing team so far.

1670
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
My bad guys, my bad.

1671
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Well, at least now,

1672
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
at least you got to play on the crazy teams that were getting beat.

1673
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Oh, my goodness.

1674
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
That was-

1675
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
You were reaching for that one.

1676
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
That really was.

1677
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Actually, I was doing two things at once and my brain was kind of like,

1678
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
wait, where am I?

1679
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Oh, yeah, I'm streaming, I forgot.

1680
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
So I'll probably play like maybe three, two or three rounds of CSGO.

1681
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Just to check out the new update, because I wanted to check it out.

1682
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So, screen is going to go black in a second here.

1683
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And yeah, thank you for coming.

1684
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
If you just came for the TF2,

1685
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
if you're sticking around with the CSGO,

1686
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
then it's going to happen in like four seconds.

1687
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Well, not really, but you get the idea.

1688
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Screen is going to go black in second.

1689
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Screen is totally not black, bro.

1690
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Oh, no, there it goes.

1691
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,000
No, it's black.

1692
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,000
No, it's not.

1693
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,000
No, it's-

1694
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Oh, no, that's wrong, because I did screen region.

1695
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I forgot.

1696
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I pulled up the screen region.

1697
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
But now it should be all screwed up.

1698
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Probably hear the sound now.

1699
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Get it into window mode.

1700
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Jeez, okay.

1701
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Anyway, guys, it's been fun.

1702
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Thanks for owning me.

1703
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Time and time again.

1704
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
How I get my kicks.

1705
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I'm just kidding.

1706
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
It was a lot of fun.

1707
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And enjoy CSGO.

1708
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I will catch you guys later.

1709
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Thanks for coming, man.

1710
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Always a pleasure.

1711
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Let's get the screen region

1712
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
that.

1713
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
And, huh.

1714
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Okay.

1715
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Let's play a couple rounds.

1716
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Let's see what they did.

1717
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Huge updates.

1718
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Let's find out exactly what they did

1719
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
getting this update.

1720
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Have I ever- I've- I've watched South Park.

1721
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I used to love South Park back in the day.

1722
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It was one of my favorite shows.

1723
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
That's right.

1724
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
They did add a server, but I gotta check that out.

1725
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
If I can even get in here.

1726
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Still searching, huh.

1727
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Let's try this again.

1728
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Find the game.

1729
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Oh, look at that.

1730
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
There we go.

1731
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Retreating data.

1732
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Yeah, I'm probably only going to play

1733
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
maybe two or three rounds.

1734
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Maybe 10, 20 minutes or so.

1735
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I just want to check out the new update in the honest.

1736
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Okay, so this is the new map.

1737
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,000
No, maybe not.

1738
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
This is not one of the new maps.

1739
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Is it?

1740
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I think I've already seen it.

1741
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I've already seen it.

1742
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
No, maybe not.

1743
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Maybe it is a different map.

1744
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
We'll find out, won't we?

1745
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Oh, I'm trying to pick up a headshot.

1746
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Damn.

1747
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
So this is one of the new maps, safehouse.

1748
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
There are already some other one like this, isn't there?

1749
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
This game is not free to play.

1750
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
It is in beta right now.

1751
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It's in closed beta.

1752
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I gotta stay alive next time.

1753
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
The more screwing around.

1754
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And the terror is one.

1755
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Will they be punched in pie?

1756
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,000
You know what?

1757
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I can't, we can't buy.

1758
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Why can't we not buy items?

1759
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I can't buy items.

1760
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Why can't we not buy items?

1761
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I thought that's what it said you could do.

1762
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I'm gonna go around this way.

1763
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
See if I can pull something off here.

1764
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
No, I don't want to climb up there.

1765
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
That's a bad idea.

1766
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
No, I just saw somebody.

1767
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
There we go.

1768
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Oh, I'm dead.

1769
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Nope.

1770
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Nope.

1771
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Oh, God.

1772
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Behind me.

1773
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,000
He's behind me.

1774
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,000
He's down.

1775
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Bomb's down here.

1776
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,000
What you got?

1777
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
It's only one of them left.

1778
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
No, that's a teammate.

1779
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:26,000
There he is.

1780
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Henderson incorporated, but most eliminations.

1781
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I forgot my name was Henderson incorporated.

1782
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
You click any clack.

1783
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Now this game will do that.

1784
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
You'll get a big clickety clack.

1785
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I'm waiting for somebody to pop there.

1786
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I have any grades.

1787
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
No, nobody, nobody.

1788
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Oh, my God.

1789
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I'm getting stuck.

1790
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Getting stuck.

1791
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,000
This is right here.

1792
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1793
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
We live a,

1794
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
you guys hanging out of a window.

1795
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:05,000
What a creep.

1796
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I think I was legit like floating out of the window.

1797
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I want to do a different gun.

1798
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I don't like this gun.

1799
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Auto is upstairs right now.

1800
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
He is, uh, I think he's created in the kitchen, to be honest.

1801
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Because he's, uh, he's a wild dog.

1802
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Somebody kill somebody.

1803
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Who's auto?

1804
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Auto is my, uh, my little doxan chihuahua

1805
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
double-man-pinter breed thing.

1806
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
He's a real cutie.

1807
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
He is a real cutie.

1808
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I don't play League of Legends.

1809
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
It's too much for my brain to handle.

1810
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I feel the same way about League as I do about Starcraft.

1811
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And that is, this already damn it.

1812
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Oh, now I got to sit here forever.

1813
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I feel the same way about League as I do Starcraft.

1814
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
The Starcraft is,

1815
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
it's everyone's just really, really good.

1816
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And to be able to play that game, you have to also be really, really good.

1817
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Yeah, I probably won't be playing that game anytime soon.

1818
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Well, this is, I don't want to just sit here.

1819
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I'm going to play a gun game after next round.

1820
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Because gun game is more action.

1821
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And I can actually pretty good at gun game.

1822
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
See, this game, well, I'm not that good at, like the general CS go.

1823
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I'm not that good at it.

1824
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
You know, we're going to go play gun game right now.

1825
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
It's a tomato game.

1826
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Find a game.

1827
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Arms race.

1828
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
You don't matter which one, that's going to play it.

1829
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
It's not gun game.

1830
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
It sure is.

1831
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Gun game.

1832
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Gun game.

1833
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Oh, I mean, arms race is the technical term for it.

1834
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I love this map.

1835
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
It's so interesting.

1836
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
You heard it like a, oh, I love the girl is man.

1837
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Favorite bands.

1838
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:37,000
But far.

1839
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
From behind.

1840
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Ah.

1841
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
What's your right here?

1842
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Finally, moving on, moving on to the world.

1843
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Now where is he?

1844
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Oh, there's too many of them.

1845
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Damn it.

1846
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Yeah, keep in mind I'm playing this in a window, like half the size of my computer screen.

1847
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
So it can be kind of difficult to play this game.

1848
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
How many bolts does it take?

1849
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
No, I don't want to do that.

1850
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Ow.

1851
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Wait, I got.

1852
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Oh, damn.

1853
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah, I wish my computer was good enough to play games in full screen and stream them.

1854
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
But it is, it is almost impossible to do that.

1855
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And I'm, I'm getting destroyed.

1856
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:01,000
My god.

1857
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Their whole team is like 18 and 14 and.

1858
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I'm going this way, I'm going this way.

1859
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Get out of town.

1860
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Damn it.

1861
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Give me that head shot.

1862
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
God damn.

1863
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Yeah, it's not my internet.

1864
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
It's my computer just probably would not be able to handle it.

1865
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
And I guess internet too.

1866
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
To stream at like 1080 or 720, it takes a lot of bandwidth.

1867
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Oh.

1868
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
No, what was I doing?

1869
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
This, this potentially is the worst time, like the worst game I've ever had in this entire game ever.

1870
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Like ever.

1871
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
It's making me look embarrassed.

1872
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:16,000
No, I don't care.

1873
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm just playing for fun.

1874
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I just want to check out the new stuff.

1875
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
My favorite guerrillas song is probably Stylo.

1876
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I love Stylo.

1877
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Where is he?

1878
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I don't even know when that guy even was.

1879
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Oh.

1880
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Ow.

1881
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Ow.

1882
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Brrr.

1883
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Okay, let's get a string of people together here.

1884
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Let's get a string of people together.

1885
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Now it's already got it.

1886
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Oh.

1887
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Oh, 715.

1888
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Flip that score around and you got a great score.

1889
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
All right, this time it's going to be different.

1890
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
This time it will be different.

1891
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
You need to pray to the Bruins.

1892
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
All powerful Bruins, gods.

1893
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Please shine upon me your strength.

1894
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I see I got this.

1895
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
My sensitivity might be wrong.

1896
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
No, it's not.

1897
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
That's an excuse.

1898
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
That is just an excuse.

1899
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
There we go.

1900
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Let's keep the ball rolling here.

1901
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
We got it.

1902
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Mercy.

1903
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Up top.

1904
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Oh boy.

1905
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Now get away.

1906
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Get away.

1907
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Oh, damn.

1908
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Wow.

1909
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Where did he come from?

1910
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Where did that dude come from?

1911
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Going for the headshots.

1912
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Not getting them.

1913
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Not getting them.

1914
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:33,000
There we go.

1915
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
PP90M1.

1916
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I think that's what I just had.

1917
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
This is the shoot guns.

1918
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Oh, now I can't go that way.

1919
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I'm going to wrap around this way.

1920
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Oh, how does he not die?

1921
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Look at his health.

1922
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
What did I even hit him with?

1923
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Like a sock?

1924
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I don't understand.

1925
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
That guy had like 80% help.

1926
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
And I hit him with like a wet sock apparently.

1927
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Geez, my god.

1928
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
That's insta-death every single time.

1929
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
No, that guy was invincible.

1930
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
How was that guy just invincible?

1931
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Somebody explained that to me.

1932
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
And that's not you.

1933
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
There we go.

1934
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Get out of town.

1935
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
No longer die.

1936
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Invincible.

1937
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Unpredictable.

1938
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Somebody up top.

1939
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
See buddy, where they spawn?

1940
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
What the hell are you guys?

1941
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I just puke in my mouth.

1942
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Pue, pu, pu.

1943
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:09,000
No.

1944
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
How come I'm going to go across the map?

1945
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
They just spawned over here.

1946
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Get my face in your face.

1947
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Get out of here.

1948
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Oh, come on.

1949
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
This guy's 29 right now.

1950
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
My god.

1951
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
What?

1952
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Man.

1953
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I'm gonna have to get out of here.

1954
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:51,000
That's too many of them.

1955
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I at least want to be number one on the team.

1956
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Ow.

1957
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Stop puking.

1958
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:17,000
That took a while.

1959
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Ow.

1960
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I at least want to go positive.

1961
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
That's all I care about.

1962
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
It's going positive.

1963
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Oh god, I'm being freaking out right now.

1964
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
This guy's gonna get a knife level in two seconds.

1965
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
To me, I scoped.

1966
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Ah.

1967
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Oh, it hurts to die in this game.

1968
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Where is everybody?

1969
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
That did not kill that guy.

1970
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Oh, my god.

1971
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Spawning right next to me.

1972
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Spawns are wacky in this game.

1973
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:26,000
People just appear next to you.

1974
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
What's that?

1975
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Light machine guns.

1976
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Now, come on.

1977
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:49,000
No, somebody lost.

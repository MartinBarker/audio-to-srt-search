1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
720 p4 the win

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Starting in 15 minutes exactly

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And let's do it

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
All right ladies and germs

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We'll go offline now

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And let us go and do a server

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's trying to see how many people are in my server right now

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My server is currently full

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But um

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's okay

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We can fill up an empty one just because that's what I typically do anyways

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So let's fill up an empty server just because I feel like

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A lot of you guys would rather be able to see where we're playing and you guys in the stream would like to play so here is the IP

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you can see it on the screen I'm also gonna put it in here

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's gonna be oh god a lot of typos in that statement

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There you go posting it right now

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Fundament

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
German needs a catch phrase like shibis chocolate sauce

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How long am I gonna be streaming Diablo 3?

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
At least a couple hours at least at least that

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh, and is the stream running okay? It's it's there's a 360 and a 720 option

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Are are both of them looking okay or is it is you know how does it look? Are we good?

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hopefully we're good because this is the first time I've ever streamed in 720 and I think the test went

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The test went okay. I don't I don't know if it's perfect, but it should be better than before

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's worry stupid

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And while I think about it let me uh

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Turn up my fans here

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How's that even possible

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The oblo 3 looks oh no the oblo 3 is fun man

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I got a lot of problems I have with it, but they are overshadowed by the fact that the game is really good

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So I can't really complain

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I have a major major problem with it though and it's something I can't get over and I

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll probably talk about it in

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The video I do when I review the game

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What I actually reviewed the game I will talk about it

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Where where is everybody

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
How can nobody say where is everybody

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Somebody want to post the ip again in the chat

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh make sure if you haven't already done it select um update automatically

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
For your stream thing on the chat window

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, yeah

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Because it's gonna be one V1 there's a lot of spots in this server

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Now you know I'll do this for those of you so you guys can see because maybe the the chat is lagging or something

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is the server

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
63 dot 146 dot 183 23 270 15 you take a look at it right now write it down maybe

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay, that's what we're gonna be for a little while

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And hopefully you guys got it by now so I'm gonna close it and here we go

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The only problem with the apple 3 is the constant required that's another thing that's kind of

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
shaky in my opinion as well

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What's up zc s how you doing bro

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The combat is incredible though it is one of the most satisfying combat games

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
At least action RPG combat games ever played

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Playing a barbarian if you didn't see the video

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Man, it was going on is this is this uh

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Will we be getting like a crash or something? I know one's really joining

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What is going on with this

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
server

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
People should be able to join

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah, I'll go online that makes no sense

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
All right, you can join off me you can you can join off me

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You can and in fact we'll join off me

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Uh, yeah, I gotta I gotta go over to twitch and say it's not gonna be there

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The only reason why it's not on twitch is because

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I I wanted 720 and I don't have a partnership with twitch

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I never planned on really getting a partnership because I of course have a machinima contract with live streaming so

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll need to utilize it a little bit

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Can somebody do me a favor one of the mods I have in my typical twitch stream can somebody go over there

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Then just tell them that the stream is over here

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Because my window is currently closed

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Now

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, I'll uh

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Somebody should replace go over there

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Streaming on day youtube's

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's okay, I'm gonna be streaming for a long time so people uh

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
People will figure it out sooner or later I guess right

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm gonna strip or T up

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Uh, I'll probably stream it for maybe half an hour maybe 20 minutes

79
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Couple rounds I want to get a couple of good rounds those and that's that's the most important thing

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Now let me let me let me get this thing rolling now. Let's let's not let's not try hard as a scout

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Just get this roll and here we go

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Know I mean the devil three is to is taking over the streams by a large martian

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Right here

85
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well when I say taking over I don't mean like it's not like taking over but

86
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I got a bob bob area again

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh

88
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh god speaking of jag I'm getting lag what rhymes with jag

89
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh, you see that I threw the milk and it didn't even come out of my hand

90
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, let's go candy cake

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, twitch tv has it has a better chat system

92
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But this is 720 and no I just wanted my diablo 3 videos to be 720 for the most part least

93
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh

94
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, where you going where you going

95
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Now we're doing it now we're doing it

96
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, that was like a goomba stomp with the scout of gun you guys see that

97
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
ah

98
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Derma killer of steam is back

99
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah, it's not uh everyone's peng's look okay. It's I think it's the server we're on

100
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's it's definitely too many people at the same time

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Maybe we gotta stop it

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Damn

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I can see the youtube comments I have a little pop-up window that comes up where I can see whatever you guys are saying

104
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I

105
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Say something in this video that could become a real viral saying um

108
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000

All right, I'm gonna appear offline now

111
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But yes burger boy 2012

No, this is not good

119
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's a dead ringer for sure

120
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000

Brownies are good man. I love brownies

131
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So if burger boy was president of the united states of america

Can you justير

151
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
This is the biggest

152
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
them

153
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
They're heading that would be the

154
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
to

155
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Random crits out my body

156
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Kaver classes engineer I

157
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Haven't been playing a whole lot of engineer though

158
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I've not been playing really any engineer. I don't know why either

159
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And we're gonna lose the game very no one's people gonna walk right by me watch this

160
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
People gonna walk right by me

161
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh

162
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
My god

163
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That killed me

164
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, so by the way those of you that were at the stream a couple weeks ago

165
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
During the whole debacle where people can see through the backpack the game show event

166
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I wanted to clarify this that

167
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Optimus Prime

168
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
was

169
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What he could see the backpack and he wanted to make sure that it didn't get stolen because he's obviously a mod on the stream

170
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So Optimus Prime is it's not a thief he oh god. I'm lagging

171
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He is not a he is not a thief. He did that in the merits of his own heart to try and protect the unusual hat

172
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So I oh my god. I can't even walk either what else going on

173
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Maybe if we make if we all crouched the lag will go away

174
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah, that if you're wondering that that and I am working on a new solution

175
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
To figure out how to do another stream like that and have it work

176
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I mean it worked it was okay after after the first like 15 or 20 minutes, but

177
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
There were a lot of issues and I will figure them out

178
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And I'm gonna get overcharged throughout the gate and I'm gonna I'm gonna mess up and up here

179
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm gonna be like sir Derpington when you when you hit this on me if you're gonna hit it on me

180
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Actually, no, don't do it yet sit right here sit right here. We're gonna hide

181
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
We're gonna hide right here. We're gonna eat cookies and pancakes until they come out

182
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No, no hold it hold it hold it okay go

183
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh dear god oh how is he not dead

184
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
How many oobies did we just have out the gate you kidding me

185
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That was like

186
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Holy crap that was a lot of people

187
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Soup can

188
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
God

189
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So I'm after this round. I'm probably gonna move on to my own server

190
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Because it's just it's just like chaos. I think too many people are trying to connect at the same time

191
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I

192
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Every time I hit let me tell agree in the comments if you agree with this

193
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So every time I hear the ambassador shot that like boom boom. I always think it's not on our team

194
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh my god

195
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Got like broken legs. Oh, this is gonna be bad bad news for everybody on the cut

196
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh good backstab good backstab

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000

Oh dead ring and bastard

200
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Well that was okay

201
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Don't don't let him get away

202
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
He's gonna get away oh

203
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
God it's like lagging all over the place

204
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
All right

205
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Run run away

206
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
All right now they think we're running away

207
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh

208
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000

209
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Hey it was a good run it's a good run

210
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It was a good run

211
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You

212
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Ambassador or backstabs you whenever I hear the backstabs sound that I always go

213
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I freak out and I turn around looking around all over the place

214
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Any spies over there oh

215
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000

Thank you for healing me

222
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's a spy that's definitely a spy

223
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh I'm trying to reflect it

224
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Get this health over here bro. There you go buddy

225
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, they know we're in here. This is not good. That's a spy. No it's not

226
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Oh lord

227
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh no

228
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Oh just die

230
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No, just die

231
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
All I cared about was killing that guy and I didn't even get him

232
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Oh damn

233
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, I guess they got the pyro

234
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
At least they got the pyro

235
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Let's go sniper

236
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You'll never get me

237
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Spock out

238
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Spa sap and mountain spans it

239
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Favorite weapon in team fortress to probably uh-oh

240
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Let us take a moment to mourn the loss of this sniper

241
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
He was a good man and all he wanted to do was just sniped and kill and may

242
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I was actually hoping I was gonna get backstabbed that was like the whole point there. I was hoping I was gonna get backstab

243
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Fio

244
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Fio

245
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I just heard it. Where is he

246
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Ah, I thought he was gonna run into that

247
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh god, they're everywhere

248
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh get away from me! Crush him! Crush him!

249
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Strategy that I never really talk about is the freak out melee

250
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It actually works more times than you'd think. Oh god

251
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Ow

252
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000

Oh, and that came from Optimus Prime. What the hell was that?

254
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Optimus Prime just like morphed into a woman for a minute there

255
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah

256
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:43,000

262
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000

263
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Where am I? I'm actually not doing too terribly

264
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000

Don't worry. Oh my god. Oh god

267

It is so scary when I just bump in this pie and then I bump into a second one

268
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Give me a headshot

269
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I refuse to put this thing away until I get a headshot

270
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Come on now. Oh

271
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000

00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000

As long as you just freak out if you freak the hell out and stop swinging to somebody you probably will kill it

283
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Oh, that's a crit screw

What how many spots did they have on their tube

298
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
All right, I think I'm gonna try see here's like the big joke

299
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
See listen to this ready so my server is full right now, right?

300
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And I can't I can't even get into it

301
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I have reserved slots set up for myself, but apparently it doesn't work. I guess not

302
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So I'm gonna try and do this again to see if it works

303
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And let's see what happens

304
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah, see servers full I have a reserved slot. I'm probably doing it wrong who knows

305
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But I'm changing servers we're gonna go somewhere else I would go in my server, but there's no way I'm gonna get it

306
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I

307
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Can't even get it to my own server I'd be

308
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
No, this is this this is like I'm knocking on the door to my own house

309
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And there's like a potty going on in my house

310
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
That's pretty much the equivalent of this there is like a crazy potty going on in my house right now

311
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
They're like break and vases they're like somebody's like puking in the bathroom

312
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And I'm outside just staring at the house. That's pretty much what's going on

313
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I can't get it

314
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Wait connect you rip what is that?

315
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Oh, oh your IP. Yeah, I just tried it. I don't know I haven't set up it doesn't work

316
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'll try it one more time ready connect

317
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Is the IP server is full and I have reserved slot

318
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I don't want to be a jerk. That's my own fault. I'm not having it set up right

319
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Party at Germans, but he's not invited I'm not invited to my own party

320
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh, I want to check something

321
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I gotta drop that down

322
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I do play on shibby server. I mean, now that I have my server I kind of I try to stay on that as much as I can

323
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Is that who's who's isn't who's on here is anybody's like anybody on there that I know

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Nope, I'm all right new server

325
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So what's gonna happen now is because my house is full of people at a party

326
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
We're gonna go to somebody else's house that doesn't is not having a party right now

327
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
See no not dark to D

329
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
After after this I'm probably gonna play some the apple three

330
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So

331
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So here's the IP if somebody wants to paste that into the chat

332
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It's right there because if I do it it's it's gonna get swarmed

333
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So I'll post that into the chat if you by the way turn on automatic updates for the chat

334
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Because that that'll help it with the the reload time but that is the IP if somebody want to link that I would be appreciated

335
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I would be appreciative not appreciated what

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Okay

344
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
All right, it's question and answer time with grandpa. So what do you want to ask me

345
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
In the comment section literally asking good question or I'm gonna punch you in the face and you're gonna bleed

346
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Let's place a red team

347
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
We're here come on. I'm not invited to the party. Where's there a party

348
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Who didn't fight me to party. I'm the best time to pass out of a bitch here

349
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I'm gonna play engineer for a second here put this down put it right here against the wall

350
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Because you never know that could be a spy that's gonna come on its corner here

351
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I tried get the spawn so I'm gonna put that at the spawn door to make sure no spies get it. Let's see how it's going on with his lag

352
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Oh

353
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
ah

354
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
What the hell is going on here

355
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
This is a laggy as piece of crap server I ever played out about your life

356
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000

00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
How old you might somebody want to hold I am I am

358
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You'll never know

359
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You're never gonna find out all damn

360
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Let me get to century help me get to century level three while the lags will have server lags out

361
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
What how's your actually work. Oh, he's right there get him

362
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You want me to high five you you look at the high five for me

363
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Well my birthday is June 15th

364
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
1918 so if you could figure that out for yourself to go ahead

365
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
What is this game why don't you even happily where do I go I

366
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Don't even know where to go in this game. I just know you build a century and protect the spawn from those backed spies and

367
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Updusty too

368
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
What the hell is on this guy's hands?

369
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
What is that you look like a friggin Nordic goddess up and get away from me you break it way out

370
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
All right

371
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Well this everybody lags too much. So I'll pull this over here

372
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And he's gonna right here is a good spot for the century

373
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
century going up over here boys. It's a good spot for it and

374
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Then the dispenser is gonna go like over here

375
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Like

376
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Suspense you're gonna go right there and then the century shoot people

377
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And I'm lagging out way too bad as he's a worst ever ever

378
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Do I get all the bitches yes absolutely yes

379
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You might think because I'm old I don't have any uh

380
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I don't have any libido left but should be totally wrong but you put that statement

381
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So if I killed two people that I leave and I've already killed one so let's get another kill come on

382
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
What did you get out of here you're making me show up on the radar is this is like bottom warfare right tomorrow

383
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You shoot tomorrow you show up on the radar right

384
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Where is the radar

385
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Where are you two two and go fight the battle

386
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You guys need to fight a wall where you're doing hit them say it out here

390
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
What's that do

391
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I got a second kill that means I can leave and put this entry down here for a suicide century

392
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
There we go

393
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
This is the best part of the game right here

394
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
This is where you get all the kills

398
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000

Go you need to go take a nap anyways you've been up a little too long

409
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Keep it up a little too long grandpa

410
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Somebody keeps repairing that century by the way

411
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Oh, I got I didn't even know I was in a duel

412
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I think you're a spy but I could I was right I was right

413
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I was right all along and I cannot land a shot to save my life right now

414
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
There you go

415
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Are you a spy?

416
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
No, but I'll have five year anyways

417
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000

418
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Whoa, huh, huh, how did you even get me?

419
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I'm stupidly like choking on my own throat

420
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Oh

421
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So is the stream is the is the is the lag in the game like I'm bearable to watch in the streamers

422
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It okay like how does it look in the actual stream window?

423
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Oh my god

424
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Chaos remember remember what I taught you guys chaos

425
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Okay

426
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Chaos

427
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm just gonna go wrench. I'm just gonna wrench people in the face. That's all I'm gonna do

428
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
There's a guy right here. I'm not gonna get that scout ever

429
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Oh

430
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Waiting I'm waiting to some of the jump over here so I can just laugh

431
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm gonna freak somebody out ready. Let's do this

432
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I want some of the walk out and land on this oh my god

433
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Oh

434
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's coward killing time

435
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I do I am a dark dark rink didn't I really am

436
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Whatever I do these live streams I just buy my my brain shuts off and I like have to I'm look as I'm looking at the chat talking and I'm doing like like where you have

437
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I feel like I like just bought the game bring back those memories

438
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Let's get the century up at least a little bit

439
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm not even like protecting it. I'm just like running away from it every time it goes up

440
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
There we go is it dude. I really do think if you guys if you're watching us on YouTube right now

441
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Did I get more melee kills than I think you serious?

442
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm getting I don't think I've killed anybody with anything else besides melee this entire time

443
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Maybe I killed like four people with the Huntsman. I did I kill anybody with anything else besides melee

444
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Maddie

445
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Why am I not streaming on twitch because

446
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I can't do 720 on twitch and we're lagging again, so I'm I'm gonna disconnect from the server

447
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So I'm gonna go on a random server

448
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So that nobody can see the IP because I think what the problem is happening right now is we keep on crashing servers out

449
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Because too many people are getting the IP so let's just go to

450
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm gonna take it off screen

451
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm gonna take it off of this screen

452
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
My boy, what's going on here

453
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Let's see let's find a map I like

454
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And I'm gonna go play some gravel pit

455
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
No, we won't just we will no we won't just we will

456
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
What is that hat with the Eiffel Tower we all highly intrigued and I look that can't find the store

457
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Oh, yeah, the uh

458
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
That is the radio tower hat from crits cast

459
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You don't know crits cast. It's a team fortress to podcast. They do every week

460
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And every week they give out player of the week

461
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And I guess it's like a thing they do where they find like somebody that's doing a lot of

462
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Cool stuff or they're doing well or they're something with competitive

463
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm not really exactly sure

464
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
But I do know they give it out pretty much every week I think to somebody else

465
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And I happen to get player of the week which is that's awesome

466
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And thank you to the crits cast guys if you're watching this or if you're seeing that's at some point

467
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Thank you for that. I much appreciated. That's awesome. Thank you so much

468
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But that's where that had came from. It's from the crits cast guys

469
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
All right, let's go to

470
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Gold rush this one whatever it is

471
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah, I want I want to get at least one good non laggy team fortress two game

472
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And it seems like every time where it's I don't know recently. I don't know what's been going on

473
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Every time it was me the streams from a long time ago from

474
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I've been doing streams for the last four or five months

475
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I've never seen this problem before and I used to give out IPs like crazy

476
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
We would always just flood a server on it would not that stuff would never happen

477
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So I'm wondering I'm wondering if something else is going on

478
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Who knows but I'm gonna try and play a little bit of one more session here with the

479
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Demoman

480
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I am appearing offline

481
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So I don't want to kill this person's server

482
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000

Bumps right into him shot him right the face instantly blow up myself. I do that far too often by the way

494
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000

So I have right now see this this this thing right here for Zirka rage

You inflict an additional 25% damage while at maximum fury

679
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to use as many moves as I can

00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
That are not

681
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Consumers of fury because obviously these ones are not they these as a barbarian if you don't know

682
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
You have moves that build fury and you have moves that

683
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Use it they remove it so what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to do this kind of build where

684
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'm always at maximum fury at least for the most part so they get 25% damage from that

685
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Just by having the fury as high as it can go and then this

686
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Enter a rage which increases damage done by 15% and critical hit chance by 3% for 30 seconds

687
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
So it's a buff right and of course I have this rune where it um

688
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It makes it so it increases that damage bonus to 30%

689
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So if you can do the math what I'm trying to do is have this be it 30% and have this be full all the time

690
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So it's at 25% so you're talking

691
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
55% more damage if I have full fury and that trying to stay there as much as I can

692
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
So let's uh let's go find bergoboy

693
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Bergoboy I'm just gonna turn up uh

694
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I'll just join off him. I'm not sure where he is right now. I think he's in the older ruins

695
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Why barbarians someone's asking oh

696
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
God lag why barbarian because barbarian I don't know just I remember the barbarian from Diablo 2

697
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Damn he turns into the sound down a little bit

698
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
The barbarian in Diablo 2 is just a classic and I'm a huge fan of the classic Diablo

699
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So of course I'm gonna try and pick it and play

700
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
This is on nightmare by the way and we have already completed this game at least once

701
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And it's probably gonna lag for the first few seconds or minutes or so of the uh game

702
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Only because it does that for some reason. I don't know why Diablo 3 is very very buggy right now

703
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
All right, what's what's what's what question you want right now

704
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Done this uh, I'm gonna show you what I'm talking about though. So I have frenzy right frenzy speeds up the more I hit

705
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
people

706
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Like speeds up my attack speed

707
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
So what I'm trying to do is just be like an absolute psycho and swing like a hundred miles per hour

708
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
See if I can't show it I'm talking about here

709
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So see the more I hit people the faster I'm gonna swing and those yellow letters those are crits

710
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Yeah, but let me get burger boy in the sky call

711
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Burger boy gunna I'm gonna I'm gonna call you

712
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Where are you burger

713
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Actually burger boy you can you can you call me

714
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Just uh call me burger boy because uh, I'm a bit of the use too much of my bandwidth

715
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Oh, he just started act one nightmare. So for those of you who's watching this is this is the very beginning of act one

716
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And it's on nightmare difficulty

717
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
You just started burger boy

718
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
You

719
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
What where are you burger?

720
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And that's where I am I'm trying to remember what quest he's even on

721
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Oh burger boy has to come in here because he has the quest the quest person

722
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
So you want to see my stuff before we get going here before burger boy gives me a ring of ding ding

723
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You

724
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Burger look at that face by the way look at like burger boys face

725
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Someone's asking what is Diablo 3 about oh, it's kind of a difficult thing to explain

726
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But pretty much it's an action RPG where you run around and you kill

727
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Literally hundreds and hundreds of monsters in at the same time and hold on burger boys actually calling

728
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
What's up burger

729
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Oh, oh, and I got changed something you know you guys can hear am I gonna make it so he's coming through the right line

730
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Line one

731
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
There we go

732
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Burger boy close your windows oh

733
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Yeah, sorry

734
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Burger boy like lives are like on a highway

735
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
All right, uh, let's let's do this thing man

736
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Bring a layer oh, she's actually ready

737
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
You want me to grab my 42 you want to continue

738
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Oh, no, it's all right. That's a matter. We've got to catch up a little bit anyways because shibby and um

739
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
And all them they're all and Bretton they're all a little higher

740
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's a beautiful face somebody said about your face

741
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Oh sweet

742
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
But someone who's asking what this game's about pretty much a loot it's about picking up stuff

743
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
It's about

744
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
collecting gear and I'll show you my character. This is my life character stuff

745
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:09,000
It's about collecting gems and rares and uniques and there's literally thousands and thousands and thousands of different items in the game

746
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
And right now we're in the middle of a the actmon quest where we're supposed to be killing

747
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I think we're supposed to be finding somebody actually so let's uh whooping butt

748
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So

749
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
So burgaboo I'm a barbarian burgaboo is a monk oh god freeze

750
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Yeah, killing stuff. That's pretty much what it is killing stuff

751
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Killing bosses trying to get better gear trying to have

752
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
For you TF2 guys, I'll explain it like this

753
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
So you have

754
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
unusual hats and team fortress, right?

755
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So unusual hats

756
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Pretty much think of any any every time like we kill a boss in this game or in time you kill like a major of enemy or like a very rare enemy

757
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
It's like opening a crate

758
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,000
It's like opening a team fortress crate and there's items that are really really incredibly are called legendary

759
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
And the chance of getting one of those is like probably one to two percent per

760
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Major enemy you kill

761
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,000
So it's a very big like treasure box game where you want to get like as many cool pieces of gear you want to get all the awesome stuff

762
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
That's the best way to describe this game. It's all about making your character better

763
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
And I'm level 30. Oh, I'm 42

764
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I should probably not even be here with you. I'm probably not gonna get that much experience

765
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Okay

766
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
It's just very addicting the whole everything about it is a dig thing

767
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
There's an auction house you can sell stuff you can

768
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
There's a whole trading atmosphere to it. It's very very interesting

769
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,000
But I've been waiting for this game for over 10 years just about 10 years 2019 99

770
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Yeah, exactly shacks exactly it is unboxing a boss

771
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And even just regular enemies to it if you notice when I kill some of these guys, like they'll just drop stuff

772
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
The randomly will drop stuff on the ground

773
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And there's a big storyline to it. There's a there's a whole lot of cool stuff to read about just interesting

774
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Excuse me

775
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Oh the puke spell puke spell

776
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Give you guys this buff

777
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That's still recharging

778
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
But if you are a fan of action RPGs

779
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
This is pretty much the series that started it all

780
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Diablo one

781
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I'm not I'm not gonna give up my battle tag for the main purposes of it's it's very easy just to to join off anybody's game

782
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
So I'm gonna keep that probably private for now

783
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Because as you know if if if anybody joins your game

784
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
You the game just gets harder. I'm gonna get a water hold on

785
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I started to get froggy

786
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,000
But if anybody joins your game the game just gets harder everything look everything just gets harder

787
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Oh, this is where it gets nuts

788
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Going to super second mode

789
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
See I can turn into this like giant barbarian

790
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Smash

791
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Get smashed

792
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And I drop

793
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
You get bonus experience you get bonus experience for killing a certain amount of enemies in a row

794
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
It's very very addicting and everything about this game is addicting

795
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I'm gonna go this way just split up so we can fight it easier I guess

796
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I

797
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Bang

798
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I got 144 kill straight earlier it was insane oh my god

799
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
144 yeah the monks nasty oh I got turned you up a little bit

800
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
There you go people probably having trouble hearing you now they can hear you probably

801
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Can you guys hear burger boy? Okay, or is should I lower them drop them?

802
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Oh here we go. This is what I'm talking about. This is a rub. This is like a room for enemies. I want to fight bang

803
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I'm at the uh

804
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Point where we need to be just uh, I'll TP off you anything. Yeah

805
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Yeah, I hope you don't mind this will all be uh this will all be uploaded to youtube

806
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Tomorrow probably afternoon

807
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Yeah, you can just take it out this except up you

808
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:06,000
So I'll just skip everything because I don't want to you know the story people might not want to see it. Yep

809
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And skip

810
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Get a minions

811
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I'm tacking cane

812
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
It's tacking cane this is on nightmare right? Yep. Yep. I think it is yeah, it is

813
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Got a big boy right there. What's he gonna drop legendary? Oh

814
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
He just keeps dropping like vintage items skip skip skip skip

815
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Oh, I gotta go with the secret how much does the game is 60 bucks

816
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
It is 60 dollars. It's a brand new triple A release. So

817
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Kind of expensive, but for the amount of time that we've been playing this for

818
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Yeah, skip it for the amount of time we've been playing this for like I'll just show you I think I can show you

819
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Uh heroes

820
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I guess I can't but I've been playing this game on this character for probably 25 30 hours already

821
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I'm almost a little bit 43 too. This is good stuff

822
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I get the next quest

823
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Yeah, burger burger boy is uh, he just changed classes. He's a witch doctor now

824
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
He was on his monk but now he's playing as the witch doctor

825
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
The cell some of this stuff

826
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And as you can see he's like 37.7 dps and the thing I have on is 75.6

827
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And you can look at the stats too and you kind of go you you stat crazy and you get all nuts

828
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
It's a lot of fun

829
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I don't need any of this stuff really though

830
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And I want money so I'm just gonna sell it

831
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I want that money

832
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Oh, no, it is not monthly it is not monthly

833
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
You just buy it once and you have it forever. You don't have to ever pay anything ever again

834
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Yeah, that's the best part about this game. It was monthly man

835
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I hate that monthly stuff. No, I wouldn't do it if it was monthly

836
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I maybe for like a month or so maybe I don't know it would be tough because the game is really fun

837
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I

838
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Can't talk about fast

839
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
But it can get really crazy when you get a group of four people because the maximum amount of people you can have in a

840
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
In a lobbyist for

841
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
You get four people in this game and it gets pretty ridiculous

842
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Maybe do we kill them to kill this lady or no. Yeah, we got to kill this lady. Uh

843
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Yeah

844
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Get her

845
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Super Saiyan mode. Oh, she went down. I'll throw up all over

846
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Nothing good

847
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Nothing good

848
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
The major point of the quest is to

849
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Make the story keep going progress the story gets some more gold. Get some more loot

850
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
But the real the real treasure chest is the bosses

851
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
The major there's like

852
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
15 major bosses in this game. Maybe a little bit more

853
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
That's like the real joy of this game is killing a boss and like crossing your fingers that you're gonna get a legendary

854
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Or like a good rare or something

855
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
You

856
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Somebody wrote

857
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Doesn't burka boy only buy games when they attend our 10 dollars 10 dollars when they're 10 dollars. Wow. That's just a lot about this game

858
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Yeah, that is true

859
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Watch out we got some dudes over here

860
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Oh

861
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Bang

862
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Oh, we got a lot of people over here. Oh god. Good

863
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
He just smash him smash him

864
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I love that move so much cleave is so much fun

865
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
We just swipe at everybody and just crush him

866
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Yeah, bosses are treasure boxes when you when you kill a boss

867
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Don't do a ton of stuff just jumps out of the end of the screen and you see

868
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
What you want to pick up what you don't want to pick up what you want to trade the people what you want to sell

869
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
We'll be at one of those bosses fairly soon probably in the next like 25 minutes or so

870
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
The skeleton king

871
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I

872
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Was making sure this way

873
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Burka boy

874
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Get out of town

875
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Pick up all the money is important

876
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
You

877
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Way by now you found a way point nice

878
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Oh, it's your way

879
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Oh, just trying to see when people were online last

880
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Always check the oh

881
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Oh my god, I was just lost my mind

882
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I thought my brain just collapsed right there. I thought that was a uh a set item or something. We just a book

883
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,000
You want to go down one of those doors and I'll go down another since we're a little uh, yeah on level here. Yeah

884
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Sounds like a plan

885
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Get that speed

886
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Sure ma are you grandpa um that mystery will never be solved

887
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I can either confirm no deny that statement

888
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Go down here. Yeah, I'll check this one if you need help just call it out

889
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Yeah, I'll be good. I got my minions. That's right. You are

890
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
You are a witch doctor. I do forget that sometimes

891
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Uh

892
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Technically deobble three is not an MMO, but I guess you could classify it as one

893
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
With the trading and the items and the multiplayer and the

894
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
But it is at at the heart of very it's a single player game for the most part

895
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Oh treasure bandit. Oh man. I wish you were down here right now. Is that all right? I'll try and kill him

896
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Oh, die you little bastard

897
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Yes, nice. I gotta check that out

898
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
So what I just read there guys is there was it was a little dude and he carries around

899
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Like a knapsack

900
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Now burger burger boy immediately like came to where the treasure goblin was

901
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
And if you kill that guy he drops a lot of stuff as you can see look at the ground. It's covered with things

902
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Pick it all up. See these these are rare

903
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Oh

904
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:00,000
This is this is like the uncraditing thing I was talking about guys this not a legendary, but it's still rare. Let's see what it like

905
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Hmm

906
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
The thing I have is better

907
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Six vitality free health per second

908
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Um, I can sell that though

909
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I can sell it

910
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
This stuff

911
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Yeah, I think they'll be DLC

912
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I've got an event down here. They already they already confirmed that there was gonna be at least one expansion

913
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Oh boy, there's a couple lords lords and ladies

914
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Yeah, these guys got nothing we're we're a little bit high level for this

915
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
But I mean it's good just to clean through everything

916
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Okay, well if you wanted to bring your what star I mean your munk in here when we get to the boss

917
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
You code just like speed level them

918
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Hmm, good idea

919
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I'm pretty sure that that that's how it works

920
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Yeah, we'll try

921
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
What do you mean when you get to the skeleton cake? Yeah, yeah

922
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
What do you think oh like you don't have to complete the quest before

923
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Oh, I don't I don't think so I could be wrong, but I don't think so

924
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Of a 43 what I get

925
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
How a new ruin

926
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I checked that

927
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
These guys these little bastards are running around like crazy

928
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I'm a melee class I can't keep up oh

929
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Oh

930
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Oh damn kill this guy

931
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Speed hack speed hack

932
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I don't even need to use my my cooldown

933
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Anything no

934
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
So somebody said if you hold oh that is good to know good to know thanks for whoever said that let me see what your name was

935
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
You

936
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Dagless thank you for that

937
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Uh, this guy just said if you hold down control while you hover over an item you can see the stats on it

938
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Oh wow, that's awesome. I didn't even realize that

939
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,000
What an idiot bolts of us are oh man you can rash all the plates

940
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
So identify these babies oh

941
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Oh shibby's gonna want these

942
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
74 intelligence 82 vitality I'll hold on to those for the shibster

943
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
All right, so it wasn't in here

944
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Yeah, it wasn't that one might be the one you were at

945
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I checked this one

946
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
What's my favorite type of cheese?

947
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Swiss cheese

948
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Oh

949
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Or if you want we can try and do um

950
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
If you want to go to like act two and try and uh like farm the boss maybe

951
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Yeah, let's do it if you want to do that after we um I want to go through a more little dungeon first

952
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Yeah, cuz I don't even have to complete this area did this one. Yeah, yep, yep

953
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I

954
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Said the cool part about this game guys is you can literally

955
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Just keep opening crates you just keep like killing the same boss over and over again to try and get cool stuff

956
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Yeah, we'll do that. Let's do that. I'll make the game all right

957
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Is that a new perk

958
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Ah TF2 was before this if you missed it it's gonna be uploaded tomorrow to youtube

959
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Okay, change quest

960
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Act two

961
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
We'll do yeah the lord of lies but dial

962
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Act two you know me when you're ready

963
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Uh

964
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:26,000
With that what we just playing right there was the kind of the beginning of act one because burger boy was on it with another character

965
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
And I was just coming to help mount but now that we're on our like he's on his actual character and I'm on my main character too

966
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:39,000
We're gonna do the the boss back to again just because he's he's he's very major boss cool to farm

967
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Maybe get some good stuff

968
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
No

969
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Getting good items does not cost two dollars and fifty cents

970
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Cost nothing

971
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Unless of course there's the real money auction house is coming out at some point we don't know when in the next few days

972
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Okay, yeah, this is what I'm talking about this is gonna give it difficult. Oh, yeah

973
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
So all boy being prepared

974
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
With that cleave

975
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Let's get this sped up frenzy mode. I love frenzy

976
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Stop them

977
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Oh, I'm taking some hits now that I'm talking about I want to take that pain take that suffering

978
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Oh, don't stand on the poison

979
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Yeah

980
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Nice

981
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Do I think the real money auction house is a good idea?

982
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Tough to say

983
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I'm gonna go activate this uh tough to say because

984
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
It's one of those things where

985
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Diablo is supposed to be all about finding blue and oh you found this you found that

986
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
But with the auction house it kind of makes it oh

987
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Let me just go buy whatever I want from the auction house. I don't have to find anything

988
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And to me that's I don't know that kind of takes away from the game a little bit

989
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
But most people probably aren't gonna really use it that often

990
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I'm not sure but yeah, that's that's my opinion

991
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I think that a real money auction house makes it so you can just buy whatever you want

992
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
And have the best gear in the game and you really maybe didn't even play you didn't even like try and get it

993
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I'm an old school Diablo guy. I was all about farming the same boss over and over and over again

994
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
So you got that one item you wanted

995
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
But it's cool as it's it's something new something interesting that they add

996
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Awesome rich kids kind of like get way better given you it's gonna piss you off isn't it?

997
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
No, I don't I mean I don't care

998
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Just me personally I probably won't use the real money auction house at least right off the bat

999
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Oh god, I'll stand on that

1000
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Get over here

1001
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I'll stand in that lighting it'll be your demise

1002
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Besides the barbarian uh the wizard I have a level like 17 wizard I haven't really been playing with lately, but

1003
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Probably the wizard

1004
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I gotta run away from that

1005
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
See the problem with this build oh boy. We got oh boy oh boy oh boy

1006
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
We got a couple of uh elite creatures over here

1007
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Oh they're all doing that lightning thing. I can't even stand near them

1008
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Oh god

1009
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I gotta try and single them out

1010
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I keep doing that mirror thing too. That's annoying

1011
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,000
That out of here all right. I'm going super saying oh

1012
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
You got nothing on me

1013
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Super saying mode

1014
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Maybe drops sick where'd you get

1015
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Oh

1016
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Not that was just a uh destructive

1017
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
If you buy too much stuff wanted to defeat the purpose of Diablo

1018
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Yeah, that's my opinion and that's a like a lot of people share the same opinion

1019
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
But there's also a lot of people that say and it's very warranted

1020
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
They say I don't have time to grind the same boss over and over and over and over again

1021
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Oh by the way, we're about to want you're about to see a boss a major boss

1022
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
So if you don't want to see it then you don't want to see it. So I recommend

1023
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
clicking away from the screen for a second because yeah, we're about to see a major act boss

1024
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Oh, skip in the scene anyways, right? We're skipping it, but still it doesn't really matter

1025
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Spoiler alert

1026
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
But

1027
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,000
This guy is probably going to be incredibly difficult with just me and you this is act two

1028
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
What was your question, Brondon? Sorry, I'll answer ask it again. I apologize

1029
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I'm trying to pay attention to five different things at once here. So sorry

1030
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
You

1031
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Gotta get rid of his snake ads

1032
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Yeah, we we we're definitely gonna wipe the snow way we're gonna do this maybe we will

1033
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
This guy's quite difficult

1034
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Actually we we can we can show this yeah, I know wait now. We don't this matter

1035
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Okay

1036
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Get him

1037
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Sick of minion

1038
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I only have one potion dude. This is gonna be really bad

1039
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
This is gonna be really really bad

1040
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Man getting annihilated already

1041
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
We are gonna get so owned it's not even funny

1042
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
All right, it's almost like half life. Yeah

1043
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
How are you forgetting the most important thing?

1044
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I

1045
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Crush him

1046
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
And saving my super saying but when we really need it because we're really gonna need it

1047
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
He's just about to give up. Yeah, kill that ad we don't want this guy here

1048
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
This guy gone

1049
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000

01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Am I am I going to dream hack?

1052
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Oh, it's probably not it's across the world and I don't really have the funds I guess to travel across the world

1053
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Okay, this is where it gets nuts. Oh god. Oh god. I'm just I am literally scared

1054
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
We're gonna wipe right in the first two seconds. We're gonna wipe in the first two seconds probably

1055
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Oh god

1056
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000

01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Come on come on you son of a bitch. Yes. Yes. All right run run run

1081
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
We got it we got to do some damage to him and he's not dropping any globes

1082
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,000
There's one there's one all right good smoke a smoke a watch out watch out. What's up man?

1083
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000

1084
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000

Oh, it's over with dead. Oh, it's gonna hit me and I'm gonna die

1089
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I need to get a glow bad of him. It's over regardless

1090
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Ah

1091
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Oh, that was disappointing

1092
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Yeah, he was a little too hard little too hard. I'm just gotta go repair. Oh

1093
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
We know we need we need we need we need um

1094
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
We need to get potions. I didn't have any potions. I had like one potion going back to Tom

1095
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Damn, that was we got him down to half

1096
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Oh

1097
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Now let me read some of the comments sorry. I was paying attention to that craziness

1098
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
When you die you don't lose your character. No, you don't that's hardcore mode only

1099
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
If we just lost our characters right there, I would have peed my pants and then like pude my pants immediately after peeing

1100
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I wouldn't never play this game again

1101
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I have a little potion person's down here and tell

1102
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
And yeah, I absolutely will do a ring this absolutely

1103
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I

1104
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Can't wait for them to come out to be honest. It's gonna be awesome. I need to go. Where's the potion person?

1105
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I think they're liking like another little area aren't they? Oh

1106
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
They're all over here. I'm thinking of act three

1107
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Yeah, we I gotta think of a good arena team because

1108
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
There's gonna be a lot of options

1109
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Bye bye bye bye. Super health potions

1110
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Okay

1111
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Yeah, this game is awesome for solo the reason why me and him are having trouble right now is because this is nightmare

1112
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
This is on a higher difficulty mode and

1113
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
When there's more than one person in a game

1114
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
It makes the game like twice as hard

1115
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
So when three people learn the game. It's three times as hard when four people learn the game

1116
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
It is it max difficulty

1117
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
All right, you are you ready to drive again

1118
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Yeah, see if we wait if we wipe again then we're gonna have to go back and uh

1119
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
We should be all right this time. I we didn't have potion you did you get you got potions right I got four

1120
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I'll be good all right. You sure? I don't know about that four potions and seem like very much

1121
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I better put on the heroic ones too

1122
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
And let's go

1123
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
There we go again, we're doing it again

1124
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Yeah, let's do it

1125
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Night man

1126
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
You know what I'm gonna put on I gotta put on a different passive

1127
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Where is it? I forgot to

1128
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Better offensive move

1129
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
When we have a second here, I'm gonna put on the health globe one because we get more health gloves

1130
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Because we need them bad bad bad

1131
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I'm gonna hide behind your minion. All right, let's do it. What am I gonna replace it with?

1132
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
This where is it? I'm gonna flesh take it. Thank you very much

1133
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,000
So this is gonna do guys that I just put on a passive ability that makes it so much more

1134
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Health globe drop and they heal for much more

1135
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
The health gloves a little like little health bubbles you see on the ground

1136
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Oh

1137
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
This is absolutely worth getting

1138
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Troy thorn what's up man

1139
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I don't I'm not sure I'm gonna make be able to make it the pack's prime

1140
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
The only reasons because I just I just it's just a lot of money. I don't have the money to fly out there and

1141
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I think the tickets are even sold out now to be honest

1142
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
So I'm probably not gonna make it the pack's prime

1143
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
We'll see though. I'm not totally ruling it out of the question

1144
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
All right, doing much better this time much more controlled

1145
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
This is I've done twice last time. Can't blame you for that

1146
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Are you gonna watch that poison?

1147
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
My guys like

1148
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
To like

1149
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Back is too awed like run

1150
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I was a pax East. I was at pax East. All right, here we go

1151
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Wow, we destroyed him that time. Yeah, well

1152
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
He this is the bottom that matters

1153
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
And here we go

1154
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Thank you Geron Gerino whatever you name us. Thank you so much

1155
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
All right, this is where we go super saying

1156
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Cue all over all right, let leave the health gloves alone. Let them stay let them stay stick around for a little bit

1157
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
You know, I mean till we need them

1158
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
I'm gonna grab this one now. This one right next to me good. This health clothing was something absolutely should have had on from the beginning

1159
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
That's what you're saying. It's all you'll fall pretty much is all my fault. Okay

1160
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Ha

1161
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Watch it. There we go. Oh no, not again

1162
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Anything but this try and stay away from each other. We're gonna like bump into each other

1163
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
All right, let's do it start it up

1164
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Starts fashion

1165
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
I've loved everywhere now. We're good

1166
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Or are we maybe spoke a little too soon. I had to take a potion

1167
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Yeah

1168
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Think as many as you need you have a tank

1169
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Oh, don't you spray that at me. I dare you

1170
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
No, Lord, I'm running this way

1171
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:56,000
He's gonna do that thing again very very soon. Oh here it comes. Yeah, it's definitely coming like right now

1172

01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Dylan

1202
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Continue on to act three. I would absolutely say that

1203
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
That

1204
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Actually was not auto that was that was burger boys two dogs. Yeah, it's too big crazy dogs. They're like 180 pounds each

1205
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
They both like like they stand six feet tall

1206
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I got I got a check on the stuff I just got

1207
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Well, that was a bad crate

1208
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Yeah, it was that was like that was like a crate eight no strangers. No, nothing

1209
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Oh

1210
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,000
The only crates I have opened you know we the real problem here is we got to get magic find

1211
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I don't have like any you don't have any we need like a hundred percent extra magic fine

1212
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Okay, he's gonna save those for shibi

1213
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Hmm those those these they're actually not that great

1214
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I'm selling a could I sell them in the auction house probably not stats on these are really just dumb

1215
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
I'm selling them sockets are good, but not not really too concerned about it

1216
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
This is not that bad, but I got better

1217
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
This is not that good

1218
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
This is not that good and this is not that good all right

1219
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Actually, I think I had auctions that I'm going wonder if they sold

1220
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I'm gonna check on my auctions for a second. Okay, so I'm gonna show you guys the auction house

1221
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I'm doing the same. Okay, so this is the auction house

1222
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
So what you do here is

1223
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,000
You go to equipment jams crafting recipes pages and you can search for stuff

1224
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:59,000
So let's say right now on level 43. So let's say I want something in 40 the 40 to 45 range right

1225
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
And I want

1226
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:08,000
One-handed weapons and now doesn't matter what one hand I want it to be rare though. I want it to be rare quality

1227
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
So right now I just at search these are people that are selling things on the auction house

1228
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
In though that particular

1229
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Category that I just mentioned so right now if you take a look at this this guy is absolutely not gonna sell this this thing

1230
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
He's selling this for eight million gold, which is a Vade

1231
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
I don't know if you're like you never gonna sell that

1232
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,000
But see you you can you what you can do is you can play the auction house right you can play the field

1233
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
So you go back to like the the bids and the buyouts to some of the cheaper stuff

1234
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
There's a lot of pages as you can see

1235
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
And burger boy is gonna like like puke on his microphone

1236
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Oh, sorry, see this is the least expensive one in here for the level 40 to 45 range

1237
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,000
$115,000 so if I bought this right now for a high of a hundred and uh 18,000

1238
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
If I bought this right now for 115 it I mean it really wouldn't be that

1239
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
That good

1240
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Because obviously you you can find stuff you can make stuff. Oh you could buy this and then resell it and try and get more money for it

1241
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
But for now, let's go to my completed auctions

1242
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
See I put this up for 160,000 gold

1243
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
This should have sold though. This is 14,000. That's like jump change

1244
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I had to see as you can see your past auctions. This is like the money that I've uh that I've made

1245
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
A money that I've made money that things that I purchased

1246
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Say I can get really really addicting

1247
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
You can get really addicting

1248
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
So yeah and then eventually see currency

1249
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:55,000
The real currency auction house will be available at a later date

1250
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:02,000
529 so in a couple weeks you're going to be able to use real money to buy things

1251
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:08,000
People are going to be able to put like oh here's my attack weapon thing. It's uh five dollars

1252
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Real money and it's going to be totally legal totally encouraged. It's going to be ridiculous

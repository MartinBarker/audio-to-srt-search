1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Alright.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Huh.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So I think it's going.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hopefully there's no problems with the actual stream.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Is that would not be cool.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Twitch.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
.tv.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I gotta change this.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I gotta change this.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It says I'm gonna be playing CSCOPH but that's not the case.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's gotta be changed.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, the chat is laggy.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I can't see any of these uh...

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The chat is all screwed up.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That is not cool.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So let me uh...

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't have a solution to that so...

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Just gonna have to do it, play it by ear and if something happens,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
something happens, you know.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh yeah, I tried to say how to spell principal right.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If you saw that in the uh...

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Google chat.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
How do you spell principal?

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't know.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Alright, let's see if I can pop this out.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Pop out.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Alright.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is muted.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Lower.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Just want the chat.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hmm, that's not working for me.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That is not working for me.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Come on, Twitch get your act together.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I won't pop it out.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm refreshing the page.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If you have any chat problems, just try refreshing.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Maybe that'll help.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If not, then I'm not exactly sure what to do.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But it's okay.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We shall push the view.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's right there.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay, I'm just going to tell people what's happening on various social media networks.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's going on Twitter.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And then of course, the Steam Group.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Steam.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Community.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Groups.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The Inhumane Strike UpWats.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's get on the mat.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Brody.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Twitch.tv.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, by the way, I'm also sorry for starting this pretty late.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I was trying to get that video up and it was not working.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't know why, but it just wasn't.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Not in all caps.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let me scream it.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Woohoo!

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
15 minutes.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And that's that.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And one more.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I've got to tell all the people on the YouTube's about it.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Channel.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Speed.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Streaming TF2 and Flash Games.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
HTTP.com.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Flash.tv.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Flash.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
All right.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Good afternoon, morning evening, night time, whatever it happens to be in your quarters of the world.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Welcome to the stream.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Flash Gordon Games.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So, sooner or later here when I get my server up and running, we're not going to have to do this anymore.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It'll just be, hey, I'm in my server.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Everyone go there if you want to play.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Because now it's kind of like, where are we going to find a good map to play on?

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How about the gold rush?

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
All right, gold rush it is.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh, no way, never mind.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Refresh.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It was like 15 people already in there.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How about players?

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I should have been not full.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's fine.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All right, come on.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Stop with the refresh.

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, come on.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I just refreshed again trying to hit stop refresh.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Valve, why do you do that?

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Stop.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How about, that's fine, a good one.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Ooh, that one is Thunder Mountain.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Caught bad lands.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Can't get the health bad lands.

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Here is the IP.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's get started.

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And boom, head's in there.

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All hands on deck.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
King of the Hill, Nukleus.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Should be a rocket time.

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's 405 in California, yeah?

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, I'm sorry for starting late.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I said this before, but I'll say it again.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's probably like seven in the morning.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Or like five in the morning for people that are used to seeing this at least at a reasonable time.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And I apologize for that.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I usually want to start it around 536.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
730 is when we're actually starting.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I feel bad for you, European guys.

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That's my fault and I do apologize.

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What do I want to do now?

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's go soldier.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, make sure the audio is good.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
How's the endgame audio?

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Should it be lower higher?

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
How's the sound?

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
My bump it into.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You know, I'll stick with the directed.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The chat's still broken.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, I don't know.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If you can not see the chat, I apologize.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
There's nothing I can do.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, come on, you scout.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Why am I using the...

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I have to touch you, by the way.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Come here!

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, which way are you going to go?

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What was that?

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, it's a crit.

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yeah, the chat's not refreshing for me either.

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So I guess just sit back and relax and if you're playing play, I guess.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
543, I'm taking the directed off.

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Get rid of this thing.

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Why am I using the gun boats?

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What on earth are these audio for right now?

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll keep the half to touch you on.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm not very good with the directed.

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's hard.

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's very hard to use.

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm going this way.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Now you know what?

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Where'd he go?

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We're going to jump around.

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What's he going on here?

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Super lag.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Super lag.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh no, get rid of that.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Scent's redown.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's any health.

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm not at all my shots in this shotgun.

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't know how that happened.

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh my god.

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh, it's something that's changed.

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's why.

158
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Sensitivity was all a little low.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I got to deal with it though.

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So when are we going to get an update?

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
When's the team fortress update coming out?

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How am I not hitting him?

163
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I feel like I'm lagging like crazy.

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm starting to go on a roll here.

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Ding, ding.

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh, here comes Bergerboy.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Who do that is?

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That can't be Bergerboy right there, can it?

169
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Bergerboy.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Hold that point.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh.

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I wish I could see the chat.

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm going to refresh it.

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is stupid.

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I can't see the chat.

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Maybe if I do this, I might be able to see the chat

177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
or maybe just the actual chat is screwed up.

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Maybe not.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Maybe not.

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Twitch, what the heck?

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm streaming on Twitch because YouTube is usually broken.

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I guess not.

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I guess not Twitch.

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Ding, ding, ding.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, I'm going to get headshot.

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I know it.

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I know it.

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Run away.

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
All right.

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This guy is screwed.

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Get rid of that medic.

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh, I thought I killed him.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You see that in the kill?

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I was like, oh, nope.

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You killed the guy behind him.

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Get away from me.

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I think that was a dead runner.

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't think he's dead.

199
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Pretty sure he's still alive.

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Might as well go get some health.

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Right.

202
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Boom, boom.

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Fire!

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, no.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We're going to get on this.

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh, jump around.

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So get off your feet and jump around.

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Jump, jump, jump, jump.

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't know what the point of that was.

210
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, my God.

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, no.

212
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm just like jumping around like a idiot.

213
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm doing okay.

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Still no chat.

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This is what it looks like, by the way, for me.

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Like the wheel of death.

217
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So I can't answer your questions.

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, that's stupid.

219
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm going to try refreshing it again.

220
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It sort of looks like, unfortunately.

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Oh, I'm going to get the chat back.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Did I?

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Of course not.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That was a spy, my God.

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That was a dead ranger.

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
See if I can evolve.

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh, that was unlucky.

228
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Look out, look out, look out.

229
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, that's going to kill me.

230
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I need the equalizer.

231
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I need to put the equalizer on.

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We're going to lose.

233
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm going to fire.

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm going to help it.

235
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Stay on it.

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Stay on it.

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Stay on it, my brethren.

238
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Get that spy and let's go.

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Stay on it, come on.

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Come on, come on, come on.

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes.

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Nice job.

243
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Nice job.

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Good job, guys.

245
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Look at this guy.

246
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
He's like hiding behind like the stakeout area.

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Good job.

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh, now I got the chat.

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Okay, I just got MGE's live streaming.

250
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What's the last thing I saw?

251
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh, I was going for a new shot.

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm not hitting people with rockets right now.

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I think every single one of my kills has been put the shotgun.

254
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Except for that one.

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Except for Burger Boy.

256
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm not going over there.

257
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I need health.

258
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Come on, hit him.

259
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I can't believe I'm that stupid.

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh, my God.

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What is wrong with me?

263
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, good game, that's good game.

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, my God.

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm just standing there like scratching my butt.

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What is going on?

267
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What the hell is this?

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What is it?

269
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What is it?

270
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
A prop hunt mod?

271
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Wow.

272
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's pretty cool.

273
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
All right, we're going to go in.

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Whatever this is, I'm using it.

275
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
All right, good.

276
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Good.

277
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Good, good, good.

278
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, come on, get hit, Mark.

279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Get hit, Mark.

280
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
How did I lose on it?

281
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
How did I lose on it?

282
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
How did I lose it in people?

283
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, I find it.

284
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Now I can read the chat, so I will, I will, oh, God.

285
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So yes, I will talk about my steam workshop item.

286
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, no, Burger Boy.

287
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Just punch him.

288
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
My steam workshop item is going well.

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The modeller behind it, he, thank you often, is prime.

290
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But the modeller behind it, he had to take a little break from modeling because I think he just had some school stuff he was trying to get out of the way and I had some family things he wanted to get done.

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So it is still going.

292
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, I got a pretzel in my mouth.

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm sitting here eating pretzels that I can't even like, boy, yeah, so the, it probably in a couple weeks, I would assume will be more updates on that.

294
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And I'm going to die.

295
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's going to take one shot.

296
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm going to go down.

297
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I just want to make it epic.

298
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That is, that's a spy.

299
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
How come I didn't get any medal for this?

300
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What is, what is, was that not really a spy?

301
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I swear I bumped into him.

302
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I swear to every single deity that exists.

303
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I was bumping into that guy.

304
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's my pile.

305
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh man, look at all these dudes in here.

306
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah, the pretzels are meeting there.

307
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They're the small still looking, I'm running into, look at me.

308
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm like, hey, I got one hand playing it.

309
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay, okay, okay, I've got, let me wash this down.

310
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
First, before I was an idiot.

311
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Oh, I got a kill.

312
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
They're the small still into pretzels, like the ones, the best ones.

313
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm not a big fan of the really skinny ones.

314
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If you guys know what I'm talking about, the tiny little skinny baby pretzels.

315
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah, not for me.

316
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Now, let's actually start playing this game.

317
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You know what?

318
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I want this.

319
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
There we go.

320
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
There we go.

321
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Hey, you spy.

322
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I bet you are.

323
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh no, here comes Gergenwood.

324
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The insensitive one.

325
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I have demo games with Spy.

326
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I can't, I gotta shoot somebody.

327
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Come on, one good meetshot on someone.

328
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Mmm.

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Do you want some hats?

330
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Derma?

331
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No, I'm good.

332
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm good to go.

333
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Thank you for offering though.

334
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Appreciate that.

335
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't need any items or anything.

336
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Oh boy, Pyro coming in.

337
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, come on.

338
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Come on.

339
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh no, I'm dead.

340
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I didn't mean to taunt by the way.

341
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I was just trying not to die.

342
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Well, the chat is back.

343
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Thank goodness.

344
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Can I play some payload?

345
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Of course.

346
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm going to try and find a good Gold Drusher Bad Water map after this.

347
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What's the look of what we looking like?

348
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's spy.

349
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't know why.

350
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'll put it right here.

351
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Give me those hit markers.

352
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Oh.

353
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Gosh darn it.

354
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Am I a fan of Frank Sinatra?

355
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah.

356
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Who couldn't be with a voice like that?

357
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Locked be your lady tonight.

358
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Locked be your lady tonight.

359
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Locked if you ever killed Derma in Team Fortress.

360
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Locked be your scout tonight.

361
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I apologize for doing that.

362
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That was not, uh, that was not cool.

363
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
As you go, oh my god.

364
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm going to die again.

365
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
No, no.

366
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Can I make it?

367
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Take your batson.

368
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Go, go, go, go, go.

369
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh.

370
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh.

371
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh.

372
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Come on.

373
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I had my finger touching.

374
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I was reaching for it too and everything.

375
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Give me a break.

376
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh well.

377
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Alright.

378
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's time.

379
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Are you?

380
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Every time I get out of spawns, something bad happens.

381
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm getting kills with a mini-century.

382
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That's one good thing that comes out of all this.

383
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's what I was just saying.

384
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You know, I'm going to move it.

385
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I want it up here.

386
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh my god.

387
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You toast bastard.

388
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
How much was TF2, TF2, was 10 bucks?

389
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I think it was originally 20, wasn't it?

390
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
1999 for a while.

391
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And then it went to 9.

392
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Did it ever go to 999?

393
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't remember it being 999.

394
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Maybe it's because I just never bought it.

395
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That's a crit.

396
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm dead.

397
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I was trying to strafe and drop down not in the pit

398
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and I ended up landing on the crit.

399
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Well, you know what?

400
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We're going to change this.

401
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Oh, by the way, I'm going to say this here just because, you know,

402
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
it makes sense to say it here.

403
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I still have to give away 33% of that backpack because it's been about five days

404
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and the third person still has not responded.

405
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So if I'm going to give them maybe another 48 hours

406
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and if I still don't see anything,

407
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
we're going to talk about maybe another small giveaway potentially in the stream.

408
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So I might not do it.

409
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
If I do it on Twitter, I do it on Twitter,

410
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
but I'm not decided at this point.

411
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What I'm going to do.

412
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll probably just re-pick.

413
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Ow.

414
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, put me out.

415
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Put me out.

416
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I was behind you.

417
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I have not played Gotham City in Vosters.

418
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I heard it's fun though.

419
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Are we going to win?

420
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
They're going to get it.

421
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
They are absolutely going to get this.

422
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You're going up here.

423
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Good.

424
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm protecting this room.

425
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
This health is mine for the rest of this goddamn game.

426
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What?

427
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh my god.

428
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What's going on?

429
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What's happening?

430
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh my god.

431
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
During the livestream.

432
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Hold on.

433
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That just took me totally off guard.

434
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Thank you so much for that.

435
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I hope I let me accept it.

436
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Let me even see what just happened.

437
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I got to duck away for one second.

438
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'll wait one.

439
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What is happening right now?

440
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Where is it?

441
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You've received a gift.

442
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Total war, Shogun 2.

443
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Oh my god.

444
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Oh this is from my wedding partner.

445
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh my god.

446
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I have to show this.

447
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I forgot to show this off.

448
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
This guy already has a suicidal engineer.

449
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
He sent me the ring.

450
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Where is it?

451
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Where's my diamond ring?

452
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Special something for special someone.

453
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Thank you so much.

454
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I wanted to really mention that.

455
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yes, I will accept this.

456
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's not wedding, it's like Valentine's Day.

457
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But yeah.

458
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Special shout out to that guy.

459
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That's really, really thoughtful.

460
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm not going to accept your gift.

461
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I don't even know how to do it.

462
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Where is it?

463
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I accept.

464
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Thank you.

465
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Thank you so much.

466
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Add to my game library.

467
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I will absolutely play this.

468
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Thank you so much.

469
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
That's all I can say.

470
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You're awesome.

471
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Thank you.

472
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Oh, I'm a little bit sure if I should grow enough now.

473
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah, that's awesome.

474
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's not a good way to go.

475
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah, I did see the new Gord Bord stuff.

476
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The new Gord, how do you even say that?

477
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I always say that wrong.

478
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Gord Bord.

479
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Gord Bord.

480
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Gord Bord.

481
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Oh my god, every time!

482
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Every time I exit spawn.

483
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, I'm going to just plant, you know what?

484
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
No, you're killing this guy first.

485
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Holy running away, that works as well.

486
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Protect this room.

487
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Let's at least get some area denial going here.

488
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This guy's down here.

489
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
This guy knows a mirror.

490
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Where is he?

491
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Change it right here.

492
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh, what?

493
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That's a big century.

494
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That is a big century.

495
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
My goodness.

496
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
No, I'm not a god.

497
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
All right, all right.

498
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Time to go scout.

499
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Time to go scout.

500
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm going to use, oh no, that's right.

501
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You know what?

502
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
For the sake of my backpack being gone,

503
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
we're going to go all default.

504
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
At least item wise.

505
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm going to go to the bottom.

506
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You are not real.

507
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And you probably still alive.

508
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I can't believe I just did that.

509
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I can't believe it.

510
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I can't believe that just happened.

511
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I can't believe I just did that.

512
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I got behind two people.

513
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I want to just go,

514
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and push myself in the face with like an iron.

515
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Oh my god.

516
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
That is really depressing.

517
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You know what I mean?

518
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's just like I got behind those two guys.

519
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
At one soldier.

520
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And there was a crit.

521
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And I missed.

522
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
There, that's a spy coming up.

523
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I need help.

524
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
He's going to headshot me.

525
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
This always happens.

526
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Why don't I just hit E?

527
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
God.

528
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
This is a spy.

529
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Maybe not.

530
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Let's bump.

531
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
No, it's a, it's Ari.

532
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Hey, Ari.

533
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Alright, let's go.

534
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Let's go.

535
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That's a bad place to go.

536
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
What?

537
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
What?

538
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
What just happened?

539
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
The guy showed me through the staircase.

540
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I am mad.

541
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Alright, I'm putting the milk on.

542
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I need my milk.

543
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I need my calcium.

544
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
My calcium for the week.

545
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
If I were to have any unusual effect on a hat or any unusual,

546
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I would want the, what is it?

547
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
The searing, towering, pillar of hats.

548
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Because that is not worth like like $5 million or something.

549
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's like a lot of money.

550
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
On two soldiers.

551
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I can't deal with that.

552
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And a scout.

553
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And I have milk.

554
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I threw it.

555
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Oh my goodness gracious.

556
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
How much, what, what, somebody tell me?

557
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What is the most expensive team purchase hat?

558
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Like in dollars, in US dollars.

559
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Is it searing, towering pillar or sunlight towering pillar?

560
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Is it like $2,000 or something crazy?

561
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
God.

562
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
What is the approximation of the value of that item?

563
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Can't even go after him.

564
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I have no help.

565
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Oh boy, I'm in trouble.

566
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Someone just has to like burp on me and I'm going to die.

567
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Well, he's don't burp on me.

568
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I don't want to die.

569
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
There we go.

570
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I have to lay to LA anymore.

571
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Oh.

572
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
What?

573
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh, I would, I just maybe sad, which is happened.

574
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm not even mad about that.

575
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm just like upset.

576
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I just want to cry.

577
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Get a game.

578
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Money out.

579
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Sunbeams TC is about 40 buds.

580
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It's how much is one bud?

581
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
How much is one bud US dollars?

582
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Get in there.

583
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Oh, come on, did I get him?

584
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah, I did.

585
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Get rid of that many centuries.

586
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I can't even go over there.

587
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I can't even go anywhere.

588
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I can't take you anywhere, Scalp.

589
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Hi, spawn, bye spawn.

590
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I can't go over there, God.

591
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Oh, that's not the right taunt.

592
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Wait, we failed.

593
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Wait, I thought we were winning.

594
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I thought we had the point.

595
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Well, that's a...

596
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So one bud is $35, so that's a lot of money.

597
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That is a lot of money.

598
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Let's go to our new server.

599
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
New server.

600
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Thanks to you guys in this server right now.

601
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
We're going to trade.

602
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Trade servers.

603
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Let's try and get on a payload.

604
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Payload race.

605
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
No, no payload race.

606
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I do, but it can be 2k, Yodic.

607
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Peel bad water in too many bots.

608
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
People won't be able to get in so easily.

609
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Here we go, who do?

610
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
There we go.

611
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Apps of freaking loot.

612
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Who do?

613
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's going in the chat right now.

614
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
This is the IP.

615
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
There you are.

616
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Ladies and gents.

617
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The last giveaway winner...

618
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I sent him a Twitter message.

619
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And he still isn't replied.

620
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'll check right now.

621
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
That was a long time.

622
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
That was a while ago.

623
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So, be on the lookout in the next week or the next three or four days.

624
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I may be picking another person on Twitter for this 33% of his back-back.

625
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I want your items.

626
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I want all your items.

627
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm probably going to play tower defense again.

628
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That was fun.

629
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Bluens tower defense.

630
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Here's the IP again.

631
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
For those of you wondering.

632
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
That is the IP, right?

633
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Let me make sure.

634
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Yes, it is.

635
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That is the IP.

636
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Let's do sniper.

637
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I don't think I've ever done the scope sniper on a stream before.

638
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm not going to do that.

639
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I need a hat.

640
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I need a hat.

641
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
One of these like potty hats and sunglasses.

642
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Oh yeah, high five.

643
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Shippvel.

644
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Pro ping right here.

645
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
That's not that bad, Norben.

646
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That's not too terrible.

647
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'd say if you got to like 160 or 150, you should start to count your blessings.

648
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Oh my god, boo.

649
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah, boo.

650
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Sorry, there's like no Skype call.

651
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I was running very, very, very late, more than an hour late to the stream.

652
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So I had to just go.

653
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
What is this guy doing?

654
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That guy was like standing in the create a character position.

655
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'm a little too close.

656
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You know what, this is a bad spot.

657
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm going to get trouble.

658
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah, I know it.

659
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That's a bad spot.

660
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Late to his own stream as usual.

661
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, I do frequently.

662
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm always at least at least at 10, 5, 10, but it's late.

663
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Hey, better late than never though, right?

664
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Is that even an adage?

665
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh my cat's in here now.

666
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Going, ma-a-a.

667
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Let's get a couple of headshots, huh?

668
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
There goes the engineer that's in like the create a character stance.

669
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
What?

670
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh boy.

671
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Where is he?

672
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Where is he?

673
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I didn't cover him.

674
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
My god, what a totally idiot I am.

675
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Stop the bloody boom.

676
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Ow!

677
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Right in my face.

678
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Am I going to play Left-for-Dead 2?

679
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Probably not on this stream tonight, but I absolutely love that game.

680
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Probably at some point, yeah?

681
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Will you stop meowing?

682
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000

Hey, you look like you could do some pee on your back.

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'll roll it right into one of my teammates' backs.

687
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000

00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I don't know the lyrics of that song I

732
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Do know the lyrics of the song, but they're very odd

Oh pyrone pyro fight that's you are not real that's not me. I didn't just look in a mirror that wasn't me

740
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
My cat right now is just sitting under the about you fake

741
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Literally just sitting underneath my legs just rubbing up against my legs over and over again

I just want to I just want to be like cat get out of here, but I can't because it's too cute

I put I tried to put the heavy out that was on fire what even just happened

759
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
That was very very odd maybe I reflected a

760
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm so confused

761
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Well, we like put this heavy out of here like the crit noise and then kill somebody like what?

762
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So that was you that I just killed I have no idea how it happened

763
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000

764
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000

Whoa hold on stop freaking out here

766
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000

767
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000

771
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Gotta put people out

772
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Oh, nice team over nice team over already. Oh here comes

773
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Damn it damn it

774
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yeah, I'm upset I'm going medic

775
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I thought for sure I was gonna time that but he had the direct hit yeah

776
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You got killed by herp and dirt at the same time they both killed me

777
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Where is grandpa did you see my latest vlog talking about that? Oh my god spies everywhere

778
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,000
And my latest vlog I talk about grandpa and what's oh my god there behind us

779
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
No, don't just I'm gonna sit down here no, I'm not

780
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I was so concerned about getting the shot from behind from people on the cart that I

781
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh, we won. There we go cool

782
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I do want to play Grand Theft Auto on a stream. I really do

783
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It's just the only problem with Grand Theft Auto is it's very

784
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
poorly optimized on the PC so it can be very difficult to do even record that game

785
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So it's something I would have to look and do try to make it run at a little lower settings maybe because that game

786
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Takes almost like 5,000 percent like CPU when you try and play it on like good settings

787
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Now this will be the last round in this server. I'm gonna go somewhere else

788
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Oh look at you you match don't you just look so beautiful?

789
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
All right, here we go ship back will bomb oh

790
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Look my spray my spray scroll ah

791
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Who wants this who's getting this I don't know yet. You're all good players. I don't always gonna get it

792
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I guess the person that I do it to is the person that's gonna get it so be on the lookout

793
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
No trades not right now

794
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Why is everybody think everybody's like

795
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Well, I wasn't going like driving Miss Daisy and do it

796
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Demo spam everywhere

797
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
What is happening

798
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Am I excited for Borderlands 2?

799
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Yeah, yeah, I guess a Borderlands one I was I had a good time with it

800
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But I don't know you you have to really play that game with other people you can't really play that game alone if it's to

801
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It's just not my type of game play by myself, but I would probably play with other people for sure and make videos absolutely

802
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,000
As there is a spy for sure like look at this crowd of people. There's gotta be a spy stuck somewhere in here

803
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Oh

804
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
My god, where are you? I need to go you how to start come here come here come here. Oh

00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000

Corrects everywhere

808
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Probably should have saved that but you know, oh my god

809
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Oh

810
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
No, no

811
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Get out of here

812
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Oh backed up right into a knife right into a knife

813
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm gonna spell out what I want to say but I'm not gonna say it s h i i i i i i i t and then as many

814
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
exclamation points you can put on the end of that sentence

815
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
That's how I feel right

816
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I got you I got you

817
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Put that away

818
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Let me hear you

819
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Final push oh wouldn't it be great to be on defense right now with a crit squeak as a demo man and kill every single person standing right here my goodness

820
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I think we're gonna get it. Let's try and get these people stay in yield

821
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:10,000
That's one way all right nice job guys

822
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Critt needles oh

823
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Oh my god, they just respawn like oh my god

824
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You want to talk about a way to burn out a hard drive? I'm not a graphics card. Oh my god. Oh, it's picking up that

825
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Let me make sure I'm like not gonna explode here. I

826
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Say this every time not good. I'm good. We're good to go

827
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
We're good

828
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
All right, change in servers one more time

829
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
This correct browse servers refresh

830
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Favour classes engineer then probably Huntsman sniper

831
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
All right, I change it my mind changes on a daily basis. So it's hard to say what my favorite classes

832
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Let's go to a we could always go to good old dog gravel pit gravel pit for sure

833
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Play a couple more rounds on here. There's the IP

834
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yeah, IP

835
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Oh, it's decals

836
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Maybe it's gonna be cool looking maybe

837
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Maybe

838
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Well the reason why I don't accept trade requests during streams is because I like to keep the action

839
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
This is high as I can keep it like I'm sure people don't want to you know, I'm in a trade

840
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Oh, what am I gonna get like let's do some trade? I guess a baby that could be entertaining to some people

841
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
But I like to keep the action flowing

842
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I go blue this time and I'm gonna play

843
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000

Oh, I'm looking at the chat right now. I'm not even looking at I'm not even looking at my screen

856
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Okay, so the chat just screwed up. Can anyone see what I just wrote by the way

That is a

874
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000

875
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000

00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I don't want to be confused

880
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I don't want to fall asleep cuz that's two songs combined in one

881
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I miss you, babe, and I don't want to miss a thing

882
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
My hands are in my face right now. I really thought I was gonna get that stale stab

883
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I really thought it was gonna get it

884
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And it didn't happen and I crouched in everything

885
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000

Just running right into people again

888
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Oh my god

889
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I'm gonna do this

890
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It's gonna be like the tank

891
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Yeah, he'll be

892
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Spies not working right now. I'm not playing Spidey more

893
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
When I a lot of you guys know this I've said it before playing Spide on a live stream is like

894
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Pulling teeth out of my brain

895
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Like when I play Spide I need a hundred percent concentration and if I don't have that it's like I

896
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Have essentially regressed to being like nine years old

897
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Oh, that life calm

898
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000

Croba

902

Where is it? Is there something up there?

909
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
There's nothing up here except this one dude. Oh

910
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000

Oop-hole cable

919
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:49,000
In my opinion I do not like that thing. I think it's just a dumb weapon. I don't know

920
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I've never used it and I think it just is just a suicide weapon in my opinion

921
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Wish there's not something terribly wrong with that, but I

922
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000

1124
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:45,000
How many of those medics were actually spies is the real question all right, that's that's gonna be it oh

1125
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I didn't get it in free oh

1126
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000

01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
All right guys, oh my goodness my throat hurts

1128
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
From just like cackling for the last ten minutes this time because I'm gonna get this a little bit of time

1129
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I want to really

1130
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Get a tactic down because I usually I end I end the stream with this and I'm probably gonna end the stream with this as well

1131
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
But I want to get a

1132
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Tactic down a real tactic

1133
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
So let's see

1134
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
So the the actual tactic is you're supposed to do

1135
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,000
It's somebody gave me a tactic before and they said you have to do

1136
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:39,000
It's you have to raise your right leg and then raise your left leg, but you don't raise the calf like that like that

1137
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Like that all my god come on

1138
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
This is the first time I've ever stepped more than two steps in this game

1139
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
So the goal tonight guys

1140
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000

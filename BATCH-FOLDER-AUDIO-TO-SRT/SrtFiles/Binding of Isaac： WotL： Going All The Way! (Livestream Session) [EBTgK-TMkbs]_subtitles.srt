1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, so guys

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Welcome to binding a Isaac I play through or my first one I guess

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ooh, I got the eye the pinky eye I

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I figured what this thing does

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
TF2 would not work I couldn't get it to I couldn't stream it for some reason

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It was all laggy and glitchy and crazy and I couldn't do anything about it

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm gonna have to figure out why that's happening because that's not good at all

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Not at all you have nothing for me

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Didn't really find anything besides

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh a chance to do poison that's pretty sick

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I have any bombs or anything looks like we're just gonna go fight the boss

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Kane versus pin right pin what you got

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You ain't got nothing to be buddy. Oh

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I see the one that just kind of jumps out. It's it's that agreement right there cool cool cool cool

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well you out

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No, I wish burger boy was in this game as a playable character

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Am I not hitting him? You just killed himself

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What a stupid bastard

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Dining Dining Dining Dining Dining let's go

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The basement too

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What you know I'm not playing as Isaac so I don't have the bomb the luxury of having like the bombs

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Get out of here get out of here

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Both both both actually I got a plug by headphones and that's one thing I didn't do

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Headphones you're in and oh you sure you want to do this? Yes, I'm sure

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sure I'm gonna be party

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's go

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How do you record games as fraps F9 I think is by default

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The book of shadows I love this thing this gives you a shield when you hit space

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm gonna have the bombs

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
MVP oh

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
MVP

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And he's got nothing on me and he's got nothing on you

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, and for future reference if you're watching this on YouTube and I'm responding to random questions on the stream

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So I'm not like talking of burger boy like he's not like here with me and my auto's not like in the room with me

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So auto what do you think about fraps like an F9?

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is wrath of the lamb

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Wrath of the lamb DLC

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Excuse me sure

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Where I love the noise those guys make

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Where

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
TF2 is not going to start unfortunately I

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Have to do some bug fixes or find out why the stream was lagging like incredibly

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Expl it was it was it was an exploit. I have no idea why it's something I have to spend some time with

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Question is actually can I put the book of shadows on and walk in here?

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I bet I can let's find out oh

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Absolutely I can oh baby look at that and

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Pills I'm cane taking the pills would be good tears up hell yeah, and what's this gonna be?

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Health up like it in and on I'm gonna get hurt right here. It was worth it totally worth it totally worth it

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, the YouTube chat is not really ideal

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It takes it when you write a message if there's a bunch if let's say like five people write a message at the same time

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It kind of puts everything in a queue and like spams it after like two minutes. It's very weird

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
She got room baby. Oh, that's a dime. That's a dime. Okay, now I'm gonna go in the coin room

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Going in that coin room

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's see all right

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This is a bunch of pills I think isn't it that's the coin purse I

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Think that's the coin purse. Yep. Oh my god. And look at this and I'm gonna buy these pills over here too

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is gonna be insane

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Bombs our key

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What's this one?

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Health up health up again. Oh

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
My god, what is this balls? Look at this guys then I'm gonna buy this too. Whatever this is it's gonna be good

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Or it'll be teleport pills. Yeah, Kane if you have any pills when you take when you're playing with Kane

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
They are just then you'll never get bad pills ever

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Is a health in that room. I want it and I want this too

67
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What what just happened

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What the hell was that

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
All right, all right, I just put a bomb down right here moved over and put up and then looked over at the chat and then I got hurt

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Which is happened the bomb like come up with me did the fly hit it?

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What the hell was that

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, I like looked over at the chat like what are people saying dad get hurt

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I wanted to open this oh

74
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Come on now

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The reason why I'm not streaming on Twitch anymore is because I get 720 on YouTube

76
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm not partnered on Twitch

77
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Because I have a contract with the shinnima that makes it so I can stream on here. I

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Can't believe I didn't get that

79
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I keep believe I did not get that item I'm an idiot

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Eh, wait for me

81
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All right, so it looks like we got some fruit punch right here some high-sea ectocooler

82
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If anyone knows if that is you get plus 20 gem points

83
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, that right there that like green stuff right here is ectocooler high-sea ectocooler the rest is fruit punch

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Pinkie eye

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh god

86
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why do they have to have such big tears?

87
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay, I get the book a shadow again. I

88
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So wait you the 720 stream is bad is that what you guys are saying the 720p stream is not good

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's

102
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I don't understand why

103
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Whole lot of weird stuff going on in today's stream. I don't know what's going on here. Oh

104
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, you got nothing slough

105
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000

Got my fly buddy fly him with me

112
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He's gonna bend the knee and away. Where's he? Oh, yeah, it's right. He only comes out when I randomly when I shoot people

113
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's an amazing item by the way

114
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Me and my fly

115
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000

116
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000

Oh, no mini greens book of shadows. I had to I'm not losing all my money

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Ha

120
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Well the resolution has nothing to do with the the chat. It's just the YouTube chat is is bad

121
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm not gonna sugar code it the YouTube streaming chat is

122
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is not so good

123
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh

124
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I hate these enemies when you get in a room with these guys and there's more than three or four of them

125
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Say your prayers because they are so annoying

126
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't have like any money

Good luck on your test tomorrow, dude. I forget how your name got went by a great way too fast

But a good luck on your test anybody who has a test good luck on your finals if you already had them

130
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000

131
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000

Oh

134
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Big problem oh big problem triple shot baby I killed plenty of birds

135
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Look at that. Oh, this is this could be a good playthrough if I'm not an idiot

136
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Like that I thought I could hide behind the thing and move but it was a rock in front of me

137
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I need to open this because they might be hearts in there I need to

138
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No, but this is nickel

139
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Across the pond and whales that's a far away. That's a far away is away. Oh the battery

140
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
This look at it's just sticking out of my head how gruesome

141
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
All right, I got a lot of good items, but not a whole lot of health right now. I cannot screw this up

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I really need to like pay attention and not die because that would be so bad

143
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
All right, I got everything in need

144
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Can't get to the secret room or an oven bombs. I am not going to do to you two again today because it's just I

145
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't want to have to deal the headache. I'll have to try and test it out later. All right husk

146
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No, this is gonna be hard. This is not gonna be easy

147
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Right try hard mode how to like pay attention to only the game

148
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Just for fun. I'm turning it on I don't want to chance it

149
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Bump right into him come on bumper cars baby. All right. We're good to go

150
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What is this eight ball?

151
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh

152
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It gave me like a rag on my head. What the hell? I

153
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Had a magician

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
All right, doesn't the magician take you to the secret room? Well, no, he doesn't it sits this it's the I can now it doesn't

155
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This game is not free. It's pretty cheap though

156
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
This game is only I

157
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Dollar zone steam

158
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Actually, isn't there a sale going on for it right now or is the sale over?

159
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah, the no damage achievements. I don't know man. I don't think I could ever get those

160
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Because you'll get so confident you'll get to the end of a level and be like I got this in the bag and then you just die

161
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh my god, I got rage now every time but

162
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
As long as I play this safe I will beat this whole game right now I

163
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Can't I can't be stupid about this though. I gotta be I gotta be smart. I gotta be smooth. Oh

164
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The Liberty cap is a random mushroom

165
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Every room and this is a chance to have poison I think I'm gonna stick with the mushroom guys

166

Book of shadows appreciate it

232
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Okay, that's it that's another situation where I hit E

233
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Right here to drop the bomb I moved over here looked at the chat and I would have just gotten hurt because I wasn't big

235
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Oh

242
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah, there's nothing I could do to get away from that I

243
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Hate I hate these enemies

244
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
If there's one enemy I hate in the game okay, I could be quiet. I need to try out now

245
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh, I'll take it for sure

246
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Hey, that trap

247
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Let's go down

248
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Let's go another room with these stupid brain bastards. I hate these guys

249
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You know what everyone just blow up right in here. Thank you

250
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Some might call that a waste I call it a journey

251
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Oh

252
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Where

253
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Okay, I

254
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Think the secret room is oh no no

255
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You know what everyone come here. Let's all have a family picnic come stand right next to me

256
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That's how I deal with those guys got plenty of bombs

257
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Oh great greed

258
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Sorry, it's just regular greed is a worse

259
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's just regular greed don't worry

260
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Give me that money and give me your key

261
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh

262
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Away

263
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Mm-hmm, I'm not going in there those rooms always give me trouble. I always die

264
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
How do you shoot a nangle?

265
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So if when I hit up and I move to the left a little bit it kind of like curves it

266
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So if you hit left and up kind of at the same time you'll curve your bullets like bling bling

267
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You can do it any any direction to it doesn't have to be up or down so you can do it left and right to

268
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Do I think I'm gonna be all right if I can get some more health up I should be able to kill mom's heart for sure

269
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, I wanted this

270
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Don't worry I promise you I'm not crazy

271
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This room if you don't know because this is wrath of the lamb this is adding a wrath of the lamb

272
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
If when I walk over this it hurts me for a heart

273
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
But it has a chance that it's gonna drop something good in the room. So I'm gonna keep doing it

274
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Come on keep hurting me. I know you want to give me something

275
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Oh

276
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Fine

277
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Because now I can just go all the way over here and go back to that room where all those hearts were and

278
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm fine

279
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
See yeah what what what what what what what what what what what what

280
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Okay, oh

281
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I almost just had a heart attack. I thought I could not get back into this room. I

282
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Would it I would have just been so bad right there

283
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I don't have enough of the ladder I

284
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Probably get it later

285
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:36,000
What is the sword room the sword room when you go in there you can only go in there with full health and

286
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's a you fight a wave of enemies three waves of enemies and then after you get to have the item that's in the room

287
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's pretty cool. I don't I just never go into it because I always end up getting myself killed in there

288
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,000
troll bomb get away now I can get the ladder if I want it no

289
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You bad pets I'll go get it might as well have it right

290
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Might as well own it

291
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go

292
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'll have you thank you very much. Oh, oh, I don't need the heart because I can go up here

293
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
The blue hearts are spirit hearts

294
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So when I pick up a spirit heart it

295
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Last only as long as it's there you see how the red hearts are there pretty much permanently

296
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
The spirit hearts are only there until they get if I get hurt right now

297
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's gonna take that spirit out of way and I don't get it back even if I get help

298
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Playing bover band right now I feel like I'm like spulunking

299
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Oh the rock oh

300
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm not I must be doing max damage am I yeah? I'm doing the maximum amount of damage you can do in the game

301
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So that's good that's good I'm stuck

302
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I got stuck on the rock

303
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Thing I had my book of shadows

304
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Okay, that's epic hack. I don't want it. Is that epic? Oh is that epic hacker? Is that chemical peel? I don't know

305
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I don't want it. I hate epic hack epic hack makes you shoot like those green balls and you can hurt yourself with it

306
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And I always kill myself guaranteed with it every time

307
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Kane versus war one of the four horsemen. Oh my god, I am destroying him

308
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I am absolutely destroying him

309
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Wow usually this guy takes a lot more hits than this. Okay, see I look hit him in

310
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And I got a cube of meat

311
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's in its chemical peel that's chemical peel all right

312
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
No deal with the devil. I don't want the deal to devil chemical peel

313
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
If that's chemical peel then I will get it. I'm so scared. What if it's epic hack?

314
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
All right, at least a dozen people have said it's not epic hack. Oh

315
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Thank God

316
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
This game is so worth it though that that somebody just asked it

317
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Is it game? Yeah, it's worth it absolutely

318
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It is probably the best game I've played for under $20 ever

319
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
This game's only five bucks

320
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Without this without the sale

321
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The expansion and everything it's I think it's eight dollars with everything

322
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But I mean I've spent more money on games that I'd never played than I have on this

323
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I bought DSX for $60 and I and I played the game for an hour and ten minutes. I like it. I didn't like it

324
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I never heard this music before actually no, I think I have I hate these enemies these are the worst you have to kill their hearts

325
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Dory

326
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I

327
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Thank you

328
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah, this game at this game is $4.99 to divide I

329
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Have the expansion though as well. I think the expansion's three bucks

330
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So it's gonna cost you eight dollars for everything, but there's a steam sale. I think

331
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Still going you know what I'm going to quelch this once and for all I'm going to just look and see how much this is

332
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You store page

333
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Binding of Isaac

334
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Okay, so the bind it. Yeah, so it is

335
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
$4.99 for the binding of Isaac if you can see and then the

336
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Wrath of the lamb DLC is three to three bucks

337
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So there you go the steam sale is overrun it apparently

338
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It was over a while ago

339
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's a very good price

340
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The last time I spent

341
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Less than five dollars on a game or five dollars on a game and

342
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'm using this

343
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
The under twenty dollars last time I spent that and actually like really enjoyed it and played for a long time was probably orx must die

344
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Orx must die I got a lot of play time out of that and the game was only 15 bucks

345
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So it's yeah, I'd say it's a steal at this price

346
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You'll put at least 30 to 50 hours into this game if you really enjoy it you'll put at least 30 hours into it at least

347
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
All auto

348
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Where is auto my dog

349
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And

350
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I didn't want to open that I could just blown it up I could have just blown the damn thing up

351
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Flat penny no, I don't want that I do not want you

352
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Go

353
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
What a bad place for this these enemies

354
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:46,000
At least I have this I would have taken so much damage right there. It's not even funny. I would have taken a

355
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Thousand point I would have died I probably would have died right there. She's oh

356
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Get away from it you jumping frog freaks

357
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Damn it

358
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
There we go see you later

359
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah, you know I looked I was looking at Daisy

360
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Daisy looks pretty cool. I just I thought it was a like a standalone mod or standalone game

361
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Arm a two is like 50 dollars for the whole package isn't it?

362
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I need to drop some some cash on that

363
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Because don't you need armor two and then you need armor two one of one of armor two's expansion packs or something to be able to play it

364
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And I think armor two is 39 or 40 or something when I saw that I was like, yeah

365
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Going this way so it does armor two is 30 and then don't you need expansion to do it

366
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
That expansion

367
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Let's go you oh

368
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
You egg burger, you know what let's go let's fight come stand next to me. Let's talk

369
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000

371
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000

373
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000

374
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Everybody in this room blows up

375
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Arm a two is free what

376
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Arm a two last time I looked at armor two was money

377
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Do you have a three is real money auction house? I have not even used it I

378
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I don't I don't even care

379
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I was mad about it at first and I was kind of like that's a little weird, but

380
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It's it's gonna help drive the game for years. So I'm not I'm not really all that concerned about it

381
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I

382
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Open sesame. I think I'm gonna fight mom here in a second

383
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Maybe this next room number dime

384
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000

I only got two more rooms and then maybe I can go I don't know if I'm gonna be able to go to show

400
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't think I've beaten the game enough times to go to show every time

401
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Oh

402
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Go go go go go yes

416
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000

420
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Oh my god, you're gonna be kidding me teleport pills. Let's just take them I

421
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Like to thank the book of shadows for making this possible because without him I wouldn't be receiving this award

422
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And I want to thank my mother and my father and my parents

423
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Go up

424
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
All right, I'm not going to the secret room just take a look who's in there my buddy greed

425
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The name's greed oh

426
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Gad see ya

427
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
If Isaac's if Isaac's health is brought down to a half of a heart Isaac is then teleported to the last room completed

428
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Um, that sounds pretty incredible

429
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That sounds pretty ridiculous actually, but to be honest if even if you complete the last room with half a heart

430
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
When you get to the next room after the last room you're probably gonna die

431
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
That's still pretty cool if I did not have the mushroom I would absolutely be taking that

432
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Get out of here you spider I never liked spiders

433
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Creepy crully

434
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
You want to thank your mother she tried to kill you this is true. This is very true

435
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But I have a short short-term memory loss forgot though forgot those things

436
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah, I hate these guys. He's got her annoying. I stick my head up and then you know I joke by you don't hit me

437
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Yes, I will take that

438
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Every single door is now open down here

439
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
What's the game from E3 you're looking forward to the most um?

440
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I you know the Wii U the Wii U is actually really really cool

441
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It's it's very very interesting. It's kind of like when the Wii first came out it was like what is that I

442
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Think I might just get it. It looks like it could be fun

443
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Because the coolest thing in the entire world with the Wii U. Let me explain this. This is the coolest thing ever

444
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So if you're playing on a TV that's and you're like let's say you're in your living room and

445
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Somebody comes in and they say oh I want to I want to I need the TV

446
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I want to use the TV and you're like dude. I'm playing a game you with this no no you can't take the TV and

447
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Sometimes I mean back when I was younger. It didn't matter how much you complained or how much you wanted to oh my god

448
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Or how much you wanted to stay in the room you had to get kicked off the TV with the Wii U

449
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It's going they're gonna make it so when somebody kicks you off the TV

450
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You can just I'm using like my hands right now. I'm not even like my hands are even on the keyboard

451
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You can it goes to the screen and you have like a it's a mini TV on the screen

452
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So you let's say you get kicked off

453
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You can just play on the Wii U pad screen like okay fine. You can take it. I'll go in my room and play the game

454
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
That's insane. That's unbelievable

455
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
That is the one of the coolest things I think of that system so far is the fact that you can like

456
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Take the system with you around the house

457
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm gonna go to this last room

458
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And plus I mean this might sound kind of like kind of disgusting, but like how how awesome would that be if you were just like you know

459
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I'm playing Super Mario 15 whatever comes out. I mean I gotta take like a dump and you can just like you're taking

460
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I know I know I'm girls I know

461
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
But still like it the possibilities are

462
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Arameless

463
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Somebody should actually grab those teleport pills I

464
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Will no, I know I won't I don't have any I don't I gonna hurt myself if I go in there

465
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Let's just go fight the boss

466
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Bye, bye

467
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The Wii U

468
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I don't like the name that's I wish they would change the name

469
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Imagine you dropped it in the top

470
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I could imagine that would be one of the worst things to possibly happen

471
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But I guess why how would you drop it?

472
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Like oh, oops

473
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I just thought of the noise they would make

474
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It's a big thing man, it's a pretty big device

475
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Let's go kill mom. Let's go fight mommy dearest

476
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Oh

477
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Go away for me

478
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You know, I'm not even gonna go item hunting. I'm just gonna try and kill mom

479
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah, I'm not going item hunting. I'm just gonna go try and go for the kill I think

480
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Tears up I think I'm at max tears to

481
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
How am I not a max tears doesn't make any sense?

482
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000

483
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Yeah, gonna kill me sorry buddy

484
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000

Get

487
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
The noises I make when I play this game is really surprises me

488
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I got back to 99 bombs you kidding me

489
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000

No, I did I did not take the brimstone from the devil for a very important reason

Going to fight what was in this room down here. Oh my god

00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Okay

611
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Focus shadows can say to milling in times

612
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Well, I just might as well go in here. I open the damn door

613
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I'm gonna use it

614
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And doesn't this do something now that's a book of bailout

615
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
There is no max damage in this game

616
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Well, isn't that an indication how much damage you do

617
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I thought that's what it was

618
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And two greets

619
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Ah, it's got to be two they got to have two of everything, huh? It's like double mint gum

620
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Double you play. I don't even know the money doesn't matter. That doesn't matter or matter

621
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Double you pleasure double you fun. That's a statement of a great man double mint gum

622
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I'm doing it. There we go

623
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
A cane versus Isaac

624
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Whoa

625
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
He's

626
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
God I gotta utilize this to as best I can come on come on come on

627
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Come on. I gotta use this as best I can come on

628
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Oh, okay

629
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Focus shadows come on. I got the power. I gotta be quiet now. I'm really not gonna do this

630
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
God

631
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:49,000
ガー

632
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
uh

633
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Oh

634
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Oh, and I got a text.

635
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Oh, I can't believe that.

636
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
He had no health.

637
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
He had zero health.

638
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I should have placed bombs, I know.

639
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I just...

640
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Oh, I was so close.

641
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I was so close to beating this the entire game.

642
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Like, that's the end of the entire game of Rath of the Lamb.

643
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And I didn't do it.

644
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Well, at least it's right.

645
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Yeah, if I got one of the 20-20 hindsight, if I had done what I should have done, I didn't

646
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
know it was going to be like that, though.

647
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Oh, well, that's going to be a pretty funny video.

648
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Hey, here's a full playthrough of Binding of Isaac, except for the very end when I die,

649
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
when the boss has one health.

650
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Oh, man.

651
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
The death animation started.

652
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
No.

653
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Well, at least I tried.

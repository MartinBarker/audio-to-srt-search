1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Friends make sure we get you in here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We like the game.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The rest of you guys should be in here.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm at starting.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We started.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's already started.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Alright, so we got, we got about seven people.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Everything I can still join.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, people, you can still join.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So if you go to GTA free mode and you find our game, that's where we all are.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Alright, what am I going to do?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
First of all, get out of that cock.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Give me that cock.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Alright, nice, nice.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh, jeep!

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I didn't know there was going to be that like, oh my god.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Alright, everyone is like killing each other.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I was expecting like a-

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh my god!

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
K-offs!

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Alright, get- somebody get the car with me.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Alliance.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Alright, I absolutely do not want to be enough.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, good Bob, get in.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh my god, it's total chaos.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Alright, everybody in, everybody in.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Alright, let's go.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh my gosh.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't even know who this guy shoot that, but-

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh, this French guy left.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Alright, so what is it?

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Everybody versus MLC stuff?

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Does that just happen right now?

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh my god.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hey, you guys are my assassins.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You got to take out MLC stuff.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Where do you do it?

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You just glitched out of the cock.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh my god, everyone's like glitches.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Alright, hissing jam.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We're gonna do a wrap around here.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh no.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Alright, oh, cops, cops.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Take about.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Alright, where is everybody?

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, this car's stalled.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He's not stalled, it just doesn't have tires.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
All right, let's do something.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
All right, let's do something.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
All right, let's do something.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All right, you guys want to actually do something?

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We should actually do something.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
All right, let's do something.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A shibby wants to chat.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He's something me one of those two.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Uh oh.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We're streaming.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You can't all tap.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We can't all tap.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh no.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We can enter his group chat.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And then tell him we're streaming.

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hold on, let me do that.

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah, you just do that.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tell him we're streaming.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hello, shibby.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's me and Jerma be streaming.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All right, who's behind me right now?

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Who's in this car?

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You guys are both.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
All right, come here.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let me get in this car.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let me get in this baby.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I love this no door.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let me just get in like a like it's a milk truck.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Who did he?

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I love how burger boys just did an ambulance.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Or what is that?

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
An ambulance or a fire truck?

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't really remember.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
All right, let's take, let's go get a helicopter.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's go grab a helicopter.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh my god.

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What did you do?

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm just gonna sit here.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't have to go anywhere.

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I could just go, oh my god.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh no, he's shooting at me.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh, that shit kills you.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No, I'm like sitting on top of a roof with my car.

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, that's not happening to me.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Officer, I can't believe what's happening here.

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll be a good guy.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hey, officer, can we have for a second?

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Can I like look at your gun?

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Can I just...

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I just saw you with my...

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh, you're gonna bring a gun to a point, oh, come on.

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're gonna bring a gun.

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
All right, burger boy, where are you?

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want to get in your car.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Who's the pink?

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Who's the pink blip?

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, let's just do it, all right.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He's being chased by police.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let me get in your...

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
In your whip.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No!

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You wanna shoot out?

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's what you got.

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm taking your car, too.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm taking this thing to a dealer and I'm selling it.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh god, there he is.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh god, go, go, go, go, go, go.

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All right.

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I want everybody to...

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
MLC's to say it, it's to say it.

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So everybody come to me on the map.

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Everybody come to me on the map.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
My car doesn't have any doors on it.

121
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Look at my car.

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Nobody killed each other.

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Everybody come to...

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
To win me an MLC stealth out right now.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The brown blip and the...

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What color am I?

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm orange, I think.

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This cop wants me dead.

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm gonna let him kill me.

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I even know I'm...

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So if you guys come to the blip, I wanna try something.

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's see if we can make something weird happen right now.

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Will you just kill me already?

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Is that cop shooting at me?

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh he is.

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What?

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Did he just kill me?

138
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Did you just back into me or did that cop shoot me in the face?

139
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He's shot you in the face.

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
All right, you know what?

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's my list.

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Screw this.

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, no, it's my statue.

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What's it look like?

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is it like a bow?

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What the...

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
All right, follow me.

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We're gonna...

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We're gonna...

150
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We're gonna get a helicopter.

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Punch me in the face?

152
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I did, but I was accidental.

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I didn't meet him.

154
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
All right, let's go...

155
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We're gonna get a helicopter.

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hold on.

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We can all these like people is fun.

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Look at this wall going on right here.

159
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Where is Bergeboy in all this?

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go get a helicopter.

161
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, my...

162
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
These cops are doing a horrible job at...

163
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
...regulating the laws.

164
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, go, we got a spawn.

165
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We got a spawner.

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Don't kill us.

167
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yep.

168
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh, yeah, all right.

169
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He's not gonna kill us.

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
All right, come with us.

171
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I get so afraid whenever I see a person in front of us.

172
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Please don't shoot us.

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Put your parachute on, everyone.

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah, make sure you get your parachute on.

175
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I love all this.

176
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There is something going on, like a hundred feet away from us.

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
People are just slaughtering each other.

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And I feel like it has something to do with Bergeboy.

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We need a car.

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We're all just running with the car.

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.

182
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, hey, cop.

183
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, get in this thing.

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's only as two seats, I think.

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's all right, though.

186
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, my gosh.

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's happening?

188
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What's happening?

189
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Crazy lady.

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This guy's out of his mind.

191
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How bad are you?

192
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That guy's out of his mind.

193
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That guy's out of his mind.

194
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That guy hissing is like just killing people left and right.

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm running away.

196
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, an hour's in.

197
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Or not seen.

198
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I just started like putting out everybody that was in a driver's seat in a car that was next to us.

199
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm going to get a helicopter.

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is, oh my god.

201
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This thing handles like, where are you driving?

202
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I have it on my GPS.

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I just bought my GPS from Walgreens.

204
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I have coughs on me?

205
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No, I don't.

206
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I guess I do.

207
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Look at this.

208
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Look at these people just killing each other.

209
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm going to get a helicopter and then it's going to be game over.

210
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Get them going way too fast.

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This always ends very badly.

212
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Anytime I go this fast, it's never ends well.

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Ever.

214
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You never like finding like a nice safe jump to your office.

215
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, here we go.

216
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Add a control.

217
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Here we add a control.

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Why did I do that?

219
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There was no reason to do that.

220
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm okay.

221
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The coughs are still behind me.

222
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Did I feel like I was on a bike?

223
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, alright.

224
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm going to add this guy so we can get him.

225
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Jacob Watson.

226
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Absolutely.

227
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Come on in, man.

228
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Come on in the game.

229
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Oh, my god.

230
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, my god.

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Get away from me.

232
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Oh.

233
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, Jacob's in, is he?

234
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, who is singing right now?

235
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Who is singing?

236
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Wait, what is that?

237
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
How come to say people talking?

238
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh, my gosh.

239
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Alright, let's go.

240
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Go.

241
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Go.

242
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, but I'll have to go.

243
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll get in.

244
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Quick.

245
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Alright.

246
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What about the...

247
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay, which way are we going?

248
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We're going to get a helicopter.

249
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Is it off this cliff right here?

250
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, I see.

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay.

252
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Alright, go.

253
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll be the navigator.

254
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Go straight.

255
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Go straight until you can't go straight anymore.

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Burger boy, I love how you were in a ambulance.

257
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I was driving 100 miles per hour.

258
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
One of our tires is blown and it's going to end very poorly.

259
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Alright, don't drive us into a cliff.

260
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
There we go.

261
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why did you get out?

262
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's so far away.

263
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Alright, so still.

264
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You already had the...

265
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
At the counter three.

266
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I know where we're going.

267
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We're going to...

268
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You know what we're going?

269
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You're taking us to the...

270
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What just happened?

271
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I love how I'm in the back.

272
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm your chauffeur.

273
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Alright, just...

274
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm getting out.

275
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm getting out.

276
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't trust you.

277
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What?

278
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't trust you.

279
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
No, no, get in.

280
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sorry you just going to drive off the edge.

281
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know.

282
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Alright, okay.

283
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Alright, okay.

284
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Go.

285
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Do you proceed to highlight the roof?

286
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I don't even have my headphones plugged in.

287
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You guys are probably like, oh, what?

288
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What?

289
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh my god, oh my god, it's hissing jump.

290
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Get them.

291
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Get them.

292
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What an intense shootout this is.

293
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm dead.

294
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, he can't.

295
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I can't.

296
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can't.

297
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I can't.

298
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I can't.

299
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can't.

300
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He's just one.

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm going to flood my headphones.

302
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm going to flood my headphones.

303
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm going to flood my headphones.

304
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think I might be re-verbing.

305
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Because I was just too excited to play.

306
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Where are my headphones?

307
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I got to fly the...

308
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh, oh.

309
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Everyone just wants everyone dead.

310
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Think about it every night and day.

311
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm going to flood my headphones.

312
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm going to flood my headphones.

313
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I see you running through the open door.

314
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, god.

315
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Did I crash?

316
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, no, I crashed.

317
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
No, I didn't.

318
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No, I didn't.

319
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm good.

320
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm here.

321
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I thought I crashed.

322
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But I'm good.

323
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh, I got to give my headphones out.

324
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
All right.

325
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We're good to go.

326
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We're good to go.

327
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So everyone's in the airport.

328
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Now it's pretty much just a race to who gets the helicopters.

329
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I got to...

330
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No.

333
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Dodge.

334
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Jump and dodge.

335
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh, give me this P90.

336
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh, man.

337
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It is a bad sad day for anybody.

338
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Cup and close to me.

339
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
All right.

340
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm safe.

341
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I need to get...

342
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Oh, you know what?

343
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I got to...

344
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I got to...

345
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I got to...

346
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm safe.

347
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I need to get...

348
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, you know what?

349
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I got to get a car.

350
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I got to get a cup.

351
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Um, hey, uh, how you doing?

352
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Please don't kill me.

353
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay, he ran by me good.

354
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Hey, this guy's idea of fun is getting inside the helicopter

355
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and shooting all the other helicopters so nobody else can give him.

356
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, he's a piece of crap.

357
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
All right.

358
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Operation take out the guy in the helicopter.

359
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Operation take out helicopter flyer.

360
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Find rocket launcher and dispose of.

361
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I got an helicopter.

362
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Roger.

363
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
All right.

364
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm gonna get over there.

365
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm on my way.

366
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm en route.

367
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Break that window.

368
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, this brings back memories when I smashed my face on that guy.

369
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He's not even moving.

370
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What is that guy doing?

371
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Wait, where am I going?

372
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The helicopter's the other right there.

373
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay.

374
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Sorry, but it's a good tactic, man.

375
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's all right.

376
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
All right.

377
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Who thinks I'm gonna make it underneath this plane?

378
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I do.

379
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me a helicopter.

380
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Please don't die.

381
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm so addicted to, oh my god.

382
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh my god.

383
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh my god.

384
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh my god.

385
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh my god.

386
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I need to crouch.

387
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
How do I crouch?

388
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh my god, what a psycho.

389
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What a psycho.

390
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What are you doing?

391
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What are you doing?

392
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
My helicopter, what is happening to you?

393
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
My helicopter is flying.

394
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What's happening?

395
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Are you gonna have a better word?

396
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Hey dude, stop crouching, run.

397
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
All these helicopters will destroy it.

398
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh dear god.

399
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This is bad.

400
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This is so bad.

401
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm gonna die the second I get into this.

402
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Oh, run away.

403
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm not even gonna go in that, dude.

404
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm gonna die the second I get into this.

405
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh my god.

406
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So I'm, it's my chance.

407
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's my chance.

408
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Get in.

409
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Get in.

410
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Go, go, you slug.

411
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh yeah.

412
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's time for a cop to was.

413
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh my god.

414
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
No, no, no.

415
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Get up.

416
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh, that was, I just really had a hot attack.

417
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The helicopters are being a helicopter.

418
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
All right, I'm good.

419
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm all right.

420
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah, what's going on?

421
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I feel like I'm driving a, uh, all right.

422
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Let me name it down to the ground.

423
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Any unsuspecting people I can smash into?

424
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
All right, this cop's down there.

425
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Burrash.

426
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Unleash the fury.

427
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Not killing anybody.

428
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You know what?

429
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm going to kamikaze.

430
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh my god.

431
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Whoever this pink dot is.

432
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You picked a bad day to be a pink dot.

433
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You picked a bad day to be a pink.

434
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, I'm going to throw up doing really.

435
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm really kind of fuked.

436
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Did like the controls change or is this lag?

437
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh.

438
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
How did I work flying?

439
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, uh, that's how we get out of a helicopter and walk off the front and.

440
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Hey, come pick me up.

441
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
All right.

442
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh my god.

443
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I think, uh, Papa got a brand new bag here.

444
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
No!

445
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm such a bad shot.

446
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I was like landing.

447
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, you were trying to pick me up?

448
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

449
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I thought you were like, you shouldn't missles that, but I was scared.

450
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Because you shot a rocket at me.

451
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm conserving the rest of this.

452
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Put an Enforo bomb.

453
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Let's get out of here.

454
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We're like being shot at to death.

455
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm like, if that killed me, I was going to be so angry.

456
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
All right, I got my-

457
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Never just spawns and pulls out pistols and just shushing each other.

458
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This is so like un-fucking-mouth.

459
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm going to kill this guy.

460
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Get him!

461
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Get him!

462
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh, I could have spawned.

463
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Do I blame Tom Brady or anybody for a Westwalker?

464
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No.

465
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah, I mean, the Patriots didn't really have that.

466
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It was a pretty much string of luck that they got into the playoffs to begin with, so.

467
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Good to see him get that far.

468
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But yeah, go Celtics.

469
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That's all I got to say.

470
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
All right, where's Berkaboy?

471
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Berkaboy is the number one target for me right now.

472
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I think he is-

473
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
No, you're brown, you're brown.

474
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He's green.

475
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
They're orange.

476
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
All right, so stream Berkaboy is target number one.

477
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Look at how mad he is.

478
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Look at how mad he is.

479
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I want the whole string.

480
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We can make him like rage quit.

481
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You-

482
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You guys suck.

483
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
For some reason I want to save Kordobomb.

484
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Get in.

485
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Get in Berkaboy.

486
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We're making it out of here alive.

487
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Get in Kordobomb.

488
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm in Berkaboy, I don't know what to escape.

489
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I actually, you know, Berkaboy.

490
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh no, oh no.

491
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, I got the P9, man.

492
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
How was he?

493
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I just unloaded.

494
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
70 bullets into that guy.

495
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What?

496
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
A champion.

497
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So are we still having a war against Berkaboy?

498
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It doesn't seem like that.

499
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm trying to get an helicopter.

500
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'll save you.

501
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll save you.

502
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I mean you guys.

503
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh.

504
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh my god.

505
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Stay with it.

506
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What was that?

507
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What on earth was that?

508
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That was ridiculous.

509
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Was that a rocket?

510
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Holy crap.

511
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh.

512
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
No.

513
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I want to live.

514
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I want to live.

515
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Get me all like the Italian scooter.

516
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Sick driving.

517
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh here we go.

518
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Get me on this bike.

519
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Berkaboy, are you on the helicopter?

520
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Go on, Bob.

521
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh no.

522
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The stream is counting my deaths.

523
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm up to 11.

524
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What'd you go?

525
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Where are you?

526
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Try Berkaboy.

527
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Hey, get it.

528
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Get on this bike.

529
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm, that's a place I don't want to be at.

530
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Let me get in with you Berkaboy.

531
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Hey, wait.

532
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I, I want to drive like the fun too.

533
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
There's another helicopter.

534
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You can't, you can't get in.

535
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm trying to hit my head on the blades.

536
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh hey, let me just get in this helicopter.

537
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Look, it's a helicopter.

538
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh hey, let me just get in this helicopter.

539
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Like hit my face on the blades.

540
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

541
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Get, go without me.

542
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
We got, we got a boat.

543
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh my god.

544
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm getting out of this.

545
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What the fuck?

546
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Berkaboy, it's going to blow up.

547
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What the fuck is going to blow up?

548
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What are you doing still driving?

549
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He's driving.

550
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He's driving.

551
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
He's driving.

552
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
RPC, you want to go?

553
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
RPC, you want to go?

554
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That was so perfect.

555
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That was so perfect.

556
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh my god, thank god.

557
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
This is being recorded.

558
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Because if I didn't get that on tape,

559
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I would have been so bad at myself.

560
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I was so bad at myself.

561
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000

562
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000

563
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I was so bad at myself.

564
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I was so bad at myself.

565
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I was so bad at myself.

566
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm going to hang up.

567
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Going to hang up.

568
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I was so bad at myself.

569
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I was so bad at myself.

570
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I was so bad at myself.

571
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
How does steroid, he's just got.

572
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000

573
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
He's just trying to stay alive.

574
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
He's just trying to stay alive.

575
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
He's just trying to stay alive.

576
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He just try.

577
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You can see, like the intensity in his, like, jump out of the

578
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
whole UN Berkeley window.

579
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh my face.

580
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Hey, let me get in that cock with you, Berkaboy.

581
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000

583
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Let me get in the back of that scooter.

584
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000

585
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh.

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Everybody that got to see that.

587
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That was one of the funniest things I've seen.

588
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Alright, let's go.

589
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Oh, wait.

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Alright, get in.

Get in the car.

594
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Get in the car quick.

595
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Alright, who's...

596
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh, the cops on you, okay.

597
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Let's go back to the airfield.

598
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Oh, man.

599
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Look at this guy.

600
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That guy just got rolled by a cop.

601
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Where was the sandwich that dude?

602
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh.

603
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh.

604
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Oh.

605
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh, let's move.

606
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Alright, let's get in this helicopter.

607
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh, look at that perfect pull-up.

608
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't know.

609
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I got a feeling this guy might be my turn to a traitor.

610
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't know.

611
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm scared.

612
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh my god.

613
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Did you just run into the helicopter?

614
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Alright, get it.

615
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh, you flipped it.

616
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You flipped it.

617
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You flipped it.

618
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Let me like flip it back.

619
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Did I get back in?

620
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Who?

621
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm going the other way.

622
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Go away.

623
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Go away.

624
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000

626
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Damn it.

631
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Damn it.

632
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Damn it.

633
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Damn it.

634
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Damn it.

635
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Damn it.

636
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000

637
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh, he comes.

638
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Flips.

639
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000

00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Can you like get it and flip it over that we...

641
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000

642
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Alright, I'm coming.

643
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I want to get in the helicopter.

644
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I want to just peacefully just fly down and watch some TV, read a book when I'm parachuting

645
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000

646
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That's all I want.

647
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
That's all I care about.

648
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I just want to parachute out of the helicopter.

649
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That's all I want to do.

650
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Let me aim out this window.

651
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Get out of town.

652
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh my god, that guy's a shotgun.

653
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You pull the front of the guy with the shotgun.

654
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh, that's more...

655
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000

656
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Alright, get us to the airfield.

658
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Quick.

659
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
We got people.

660
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
We got bogies on us.

661
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000

662
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000

663
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
He's pulling me out of the car.

664
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000

665
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Oh!

666
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000

667
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000

668
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Oh.

669
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh!

670
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Oh.

671
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Oh.

672
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh.

673
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh...

674
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Oh.

675
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh no.

676
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm not going to...

677
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Oh, oh.

678
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Oh.

679
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Haha.

680
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Haha.

681
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah, I'm not going to be doing it.

682
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm not going to be doing it.

683
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah, I'm not going to be doing it.

684
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Geez!

685
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I love how this is just a race.

686
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's all this is just who can get an helicopter.

687
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
What is that cop doing?

688
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Freak.

689
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
He's a bad guy.

690
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh man, look at this chaos.

691
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We got a fight going on over here boys.

692
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You got an RPG doesn't he?

693
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yeah.

694
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Alright, I'm getting out of there now.

695
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh wait, burgundy or dead?

696
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm like sitting in the car with you.

697
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Who gives you?

698
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Alright, we're at the airfield waiting for a spawn.

699
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Come on.

700
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Spawn a copter.

701
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
They're on the air, aren't they?

702
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Oh man.

703
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I never really liked shooting.

704
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Nobody just wants to run cars into each other.

705
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Where's these helicopters?

706
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm taking cover behind.

707
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I know someone's going to come and just smash into us.

708
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Oh yeah, take the cover.

709
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm stuck on the door right now.

710
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man.

711
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Oh no, no, no!

712
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Alright, at least I would have died from that explosion.

713
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
If I didn't die from that explosion, I would have died from the...

714
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You know what? I'm going this way.

715
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I got a plane.

716
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'll leave helicopters soon.

717
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I got a plane.

718
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You know, I have a plane and it's going to work.

719
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Oh, it is absolutely going to work.

720
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Maybe it won't. Probably not.

721
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, I'll take the cop, huh?

722
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'll take the cop, huh?

723
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
For those of you asking in the stream, this is episodes from Liberty City.

724
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's the expansion of GTA IV.

725
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
We're playing the Ballad of Gay Tony.

726
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And if you want to join...

727
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Did you just see that helicopter crash?

728
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That was...

729
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Who is in this helicopter? Is it a real question?

730
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So if you want to join my name on here,

731
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
is Jerma with 4 A's and just join the game I'm in once you've done a final question.

732
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You should be able to...

733
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
LCPG!

734
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh my goodness.

735
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
That is a missile coming at us.

736
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm getting out.

737
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Of course I have three stars.

738
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Fantastic.

739
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Alright, let's set up shop here.

740
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm going to add Zeus.

741
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Where are I, Zeus?

742
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh, not the back.

743
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Oh my god.

744
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm in the middle of inviting somebody to the game and I just hear a crash and you're next to me.

745
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And invite to the game.

746
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Alright.

747
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Okay.

748
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What am I doing?

749
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm just like creeping.

750
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
No, I'm waiting for a helicopter.

751
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
No, there's no way I'm going to get it.

752
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh my god.

753
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Alright, I'm getting in.

754
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Look at all these people everywhere.

755
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm going to do a plan B.

756
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Look at the mini-map.

757
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Look at how many police are here.

758
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Look at the mini-map.

759
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Look at the mini-map.

760
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
That's ridiculous.

761
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Oh, I just barely almost got in there.

762
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Alright, new plan.

763
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm doing plan B.

764
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I am absolutely-

765
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
What else plan B?

766
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Plan B.

767
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Is to go get the helicopter.

768
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Look at that.

769
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Oh, here comes the SWAT team.

770
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Good thing they're not coming after me.

771
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
How tall?

772
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Somebody's already doing plan B.

773
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Somebody's already doing plan B.

774
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
What did he say it was?

775
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
To go base jump.

776
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And go float over here.

777
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Who is this?

778
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Who is nobody even in here?

779
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm taking this.

780
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Give me that.

781
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Give it to me.

782
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Get out of there.

783
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Oh man, that was bad.

784
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm sorry Mr.

785
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Avrilous Driver.

786
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You just try to help people.

787
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm such a bad person.

788
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm sorry.

789
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Wooo!

790
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Alright, turn that off.

791
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That's going to get annoying.

792
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Alright, let's see.

793
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I need to go right here.

794
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Why am I flipped over?

795
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I just ran to you.

796
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You're on fire.

797
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Oh my god, you're on fire.

798
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You're on fire.

799
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You're on fire.

800
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
No!

801
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Get away from that cop.

802
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Give me this one.

803
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
No!

804
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Give me this.

805
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Give me this.

806
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Don't drive away.

807
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Did I get him?

808
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
No, I didn't.

809
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Come here.

810
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Come here.

811
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
This is lagging.

812
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I got away.

813
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Alright, let's see if the plane comes.

814
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Come pick me up.

815
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Let's see it around.

816
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Oh, he's coming.

817
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Alright, come here.

818
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I wasn't going to run into you, I promise.

819
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Oh, I'm in the back seat.

820
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Alright, driving Mr. Daisy.

821
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Driving Mr. Stealth.

822
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Alright, hopefully this building is tall enough.

823
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So we can like base jump off of it and fly into the action.

824
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That's a right hand.

825
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Oh, jeez.

826
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Please exit the vehicle and watch your hands and feet.

827
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Thank you for riding in German the worst car driver in the world.

828
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Thank you so much.

829
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
No, don't shoot me.

830
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Are you going to blow it up?

831
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I see.

832
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
No, I'm shooting all the times.

833
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Would a Delic this will be on YouTube?

834
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It will.

835
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The whole thing will be on YouTube.

836
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Probably tomorrow.

837
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Alright, are we going to get a new car?

838
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
We need a new car.

839
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Oh, somebody's already doing the parachute.

840
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Where are the cars?

841
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I found a motorcycle.

842
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Oh, jeez.

843
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Is this the guy?

844
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Why is he?

845
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Oh, get this guy.

846
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Shoot him!

847
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Shoot this guy!

848
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Shoot him!

849
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Kill him!

850
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Kill him!

851
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Oh, he's going to get the car.

852
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
He's going to get the car.

853
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Where is he?

854
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I found a motorcycle.

855
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Oh, jeez.

856
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Is this the guy?

857
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Why is he?

858
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Oh, get this guy!

859
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Shoot him!

860
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Kill him!

861
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Kill him!

862
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Alright, I got a car.

863
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Where am I going?

864
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Alright, I'm right there.

865
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm right here.

866
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Oh, he's the guy that was shooting us.

867
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Let's back into him!

868
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Oh!

869
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I will run you over as many times as I have to.

870
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm getting out of here.

871
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm going to do that base, Johnny.

872
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's going to happen.

873
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Let's try the corner.

874
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Here we go.

875
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Oh, this is a really small building.

876
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
This is going to...

877
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Is there a taxi I can call?

878
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Actually, that's not that small.

879
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I don't think I have access in multiple areas.

880
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, dude.

881
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

882
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Alright.

883
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So, how high up am I?

884
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Actually, it is pretty damn high.

885
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Alright, where's the action going on?

886
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Over here.

887
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So, I got to jump off this side.

888
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And...

889
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Let's go!

890
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Open!

891
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Open!

892
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Alright, let's see if I can like...

893
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
float into the madness.

894
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
That guy's a helicopter.

895
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Float on the helicopter, boy.

896
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That'll be pretty easy.

897
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Ah, look at how relaxing this is.

898
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Just floating around, relaxing with my body.

899
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm going to go back to the other side.

900
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Just floating around, relaxing with my friends.

901
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Oh, hey, stealth.

902
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I made it.

903
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
That was fun.

904
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Oh!

905
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Let's go do that again.

906
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Except, last time, I want to get on this.

907
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I want to get on the bike.

908
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I want to get on the bike.

909
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm trying to...

910
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I can't just float.

911
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
What?

912
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
This is right next to me.

913
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Oh, my God.

914
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I can't run right there.

915
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
He was still in the riding position.

916
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
He jumped up and he was like, oh, nothing's going on here.

917
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm just like, still riding the bike.

918
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
What the hell is that?

919
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Oh, I love how many glitches are in this game.

920
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Oh, geez!

921
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Oh, my God.

922
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I can't control it.

923
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Oh, it must have played baseball.

924
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
We got enough people to play baseball.

925
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
We got like, this is enough people in here.

926
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
All right, I'm going to be the pitcher.

927
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I'll be the batter.

928
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Let's play grenade baseball.

929
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Do we have any grenades?

930
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm the batter.

931
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
All right, ready?

932
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So I'm going to throw the ball.

933
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
All right, he did it.

934
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Boom!

935
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Oh, look at the ball.

936
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It went so far.

937
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Look at the far one.

938
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Around first pass, go to second.

939
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, no, I got to throw about.

940
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Oh, I didn't get him.

941
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Oh, no, the ball got thrown in.

942
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Oh, he's still safe.

943
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Here you are.

944
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You got a triple.

945
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You got a triple.

946
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, wait, no, no, no, no.

947
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You have to leave the car.

948
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh, but it's a ghost man.

949
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah, so then you have to get in the car and drive to home plate.

950
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So you get over there.

951
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So you get over.

952
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
That was something on the screen just right.

953
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The crowd goes wild.

954
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
All right, so here we go.

955
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Ready?

956
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah.

957
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I pitched it.

958
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
All right, now go run to first pass.

959
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Oh, missed.

960
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Oh, god, there's another guy here.

961
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
We're playing baseball, too.

962
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Oh, it's Zeus.

963
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Oh, yeah, we'll play baseball.

964
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Do you want to play baseball?

965
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
My runny got home.

966
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I got a single.

967
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Zeus, you're up.

968
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
All right, baseball is over.

969
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I win because you didn't get home.

970
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
What's my, what do I win?

971
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I just shot you in the toe.

972
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
All right, run home.

973
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Do you real home?

974
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
What, what, what, what?

975
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
He's got a bad news bear's joke.

976
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:26,000
All right, hey, oh, it's getting the tanker.

977
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Let's get in the tanker.

978
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Please tell me those explode.

979
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Please tell me those, please tell me.

980
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
No, no, don't shoot it.

981
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Don't shoot it.

982
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Is it connected?

983
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
No, it's not connected.

984
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I don't think we can't connect with this.

985
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
This is an GTA San Andreas.

986
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
They definitely explode, though, for sure.

987
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Oh, let's see if I can connect them.

988
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You're going to die.

989
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You're going to die in like two seconds.

990
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
The fighter's gone.

991
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Oh, my god.

992
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Look at this burger boy to save the day.

993
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Wow, what a pro.

994
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Let me get in.

995
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
No, I want to get in this.

996
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
No, I want to get in this.

997
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
He just left.

998
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
All right, birdie.

999
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm going to get in this.

1000
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm going to get in this.

1001
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm going to get in this.

1002
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
He just flipped.

1003
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
All right, burger boy, go as high as you can.

1004
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
How did he do it?

1005
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
He just flipped that car.

1006
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
That's like a five million pound car.

1007
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
He just flipped it over.

1008
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I still have my parachute, right?

1009
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I hope so.

1010
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I love how you just came out of no way of burger boy.

1011
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,000
That was like amazing.

1012
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I don't believe that thing flipped my finger.

1013
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
That's why I left so hot.

1014
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Oh, burger boy, you're going to waste all your ramble.

1015
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
All right, ready?

1016
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Here we go.

1017
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I am going to jump out of the, I'm going to parachute.

1018
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm going to parachute and see how long I can parachute for.

1019
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So keep going up.

1020
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Shoot, oh shoot all the pre-fall down there.

1021
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Wow, we are up really high.

1022
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I think this is as high as we can go.

1023
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Thanks, burger boy.

1024
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Woohoo!

1025
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Oh yeah.

1026
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Thanks, burger boy.

1027
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So I'm going to watch and see where burger boy goes.

1028
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So I'll tell you a story while I'm parachute.

1029
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's like story time.

1030
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So one time.

1031
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Let's see how long it takes before I can finish this story.

1032
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
One time I was in Halloween.

1033
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I was having a good time as an inch turtles.

1034
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And the story is really going nowhere.

1035
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I just want to try and talk and see how long it takes for me to land.

1036
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Let's see.

1037
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Oh, more talking.

1038
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I love on this beat.

1039
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I feel the same way.

1040
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I feel the same way where we were just talking in a different language.

1041
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Woohoo!

1042
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Woohoo!

1043
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Woohoo!

1044
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Woohoo!

1045
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Woohoo!

1046
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Woohoo!

1047
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Woohoo!

1048
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Who is even talking?

1049
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I just heard a language I am not familiar with.

1050
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Wow.

1051
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Who thinks I've placed your bets?

1052
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Am I going to die right now?

1053
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Am I going to die right now when I land?

1054
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
We'll find out.

1055
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Oh, it can't be somebody who is now chasing me.

1056
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And I have a feeling they are going to take me out.

1057
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Oh, it's a burger boy.

1058
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
He's like patrolling the sky.

1059
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
He's like keeping his safe.

1060
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
He's patrolling the airwaves.

1061
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
There's a helicopter pad right here.

1062
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Why did I not come here to begin with?

1063
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Is anybody...

1064
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's like a secret helicopter pad.

1065
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Does anybody know about this?

1066
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
There's no helicopter here.

1067
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Hey, look at that.

1068
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Two minutes.

1069
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
That took two minutes.

1070
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh my god, what a long time.

1071
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Epic landing.

1072
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Let's just jump over here.

1073
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Okay, I thought I was going to die.

1074
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That was scary.

1075
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You're on the run.

1076
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You're at the airport.

1077
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I know. I'm fine.

1078
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm fine.

1079
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm flying the big one.

1080
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I feel like the big one has a little more control.

1081
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Who's that?

1082
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Is that a burger boy?

1083
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It is.

1084
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Hold on, don't take it off yet.

1085
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'll never get in the way.

1086
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I just hit him with the blades.

1087
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm sorry, burger boy.

1088
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm sorry.

1089
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm so sorry.

1090
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I had to do it.

1091
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I don't think he died.

1092
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
He's still alive.

1093
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I said he killed him.

1094
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I'm going.

1095
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm going.

1096
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm going.

1097
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Wait, Zeus.

1098
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Can you imagine if you landed from that high up?

1099
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
If you landed flat on your stomach,

1100
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
you were inside, but just explode.

1101
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Oh, God.

1102
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
That would be so horrible.

1103
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You would not want to be at that crime scene.

1104
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Cleaning that up.

1105
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
What?

1106
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
What the hell was that?

1107
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
That guy just...

1108
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Okay, I'll take the car.

1109
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Fine.

1110
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Oh, that guy's got an automatic gun.

1111
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Goodbye.

1112
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Turn this way.

1113
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
All right.

1114
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm going to play in cinematic mode for the remainder of the game.

1115
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Build to the...

1116
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Look at this.

1117
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Oh, it's a trailer.

1118
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I wonder how long I can survive.

1119
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Oh, my God.

1120
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I hope everyone in the stream just saw that.

1121
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
He can't, I don't like it.

1122
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You're doing on my screen.

1123
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You just...

1124
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
How am I still?

1125
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
How am I still?

1126
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Oh, I can't play this game for more than an hour, man.

1127
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And my head starts to hurt from laughing at it, like the nonsense.

1128
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Michael Bay, present.

1129
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
What?

1130
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
What is that?

1131
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
What happened to it?

1132
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
What is going on?

1133
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
What is going on?

1134
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Why, why, why?

1135
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
The actor in here?

1136
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Why am I like a teddy bear, like hippopotamus?

1137
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Why?

1138
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Why, why are we like a parade float?

1139
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in.

1140
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Get in here.

1141
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Get in here.

1142
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
We got to get another person in this car.

1143
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Zeus, Zeus is right above us.

1144
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Zeus, get in this car.

1145
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Take the other seat in here.

1146
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Somebody please get in there so we can have a sodding can for a parade float.

1147
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Zeus is trying to land right now.

1148
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Hold on.

1149
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
He's going out.

1150
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Let's just try.

1151
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm going to turn.

1152
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Before I get into uncontrollable after, when I turn, watch the heads go back into the car

1153
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
stall.

1154
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Alright.

1155
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
We don't have any of those.

1156
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Paulie the hippopotamus.

1157
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Let's play hungry, hungry, hungry hippos.

1158
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Let's play hungry hungry hippos.

1159
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Just hit control.

1160
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm going to stand right here.

1161
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
You stand opposite me and keep hitting control over it over again.

1162
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Hungry hungry hippos.

1163
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Hungry hungry hippos.

1164
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Hungry hungry hippos.

1165
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Oh my god.

1166
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Zeus is right here.

1167
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Oh Zeus is a normal human.

1168
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Why is he normal?

1169
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
You must have died.

1170
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Get in this new cock.

1171
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Get in this like a camera.

1172
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh my god.

1173
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
How does that happen?

1174
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Are you guys in?

1175
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Look at our heads.

1176
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Alright.

1177
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Watch the heads when I turn.

1178
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
This is the funniest damn thing ever.

1179
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm going to get some speed.

1180
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Oh no.

1181
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Did you watch the heads?

1182
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Here we go.

1183
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Alright.

1184
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Come on.

1185
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Look at out of this mode.

1186
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I don't want this mode.

1187
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I want like the head mode.

1188
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I don't want to go too fast.

1189
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Oh, the spirit.

1190
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Look at her.

1191
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Oh.

1192
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
How can I keep switching out?

1193
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I want to see like the heads tilt.

1194
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
This is the dumbest thing ever.

1195
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I don't know.

1196
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
But there must be an advent in here.

1197
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Look at the heads.

1198
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
We look like a Barney.

1199
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I feel like.

1200
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Alright.

1201
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Look at what this looks like right now.

1202
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
This looks like America's like most wanted videotapes.

1203
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And it's like what kind of criminals are we?

1204
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
You know what I mean?

1205
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Look at the criminals.

1206
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Driving away and they're crazy costumes.

1207
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Like they're trying to hide their identities.

1208
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
What way?

1209
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
What wouldn't you press the automatic?

1210
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It's a V until you get there.

1211
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Alright, here's the real kicker.

1212
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Oh god, I'm out of control.

1213
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Alright, this is going to be, I'm going to laugh uncontrollably at this.

1214
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Alright, Zeus get in here.

1215
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
America's most wanted.

1216
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Like the hungry, hungry hippo.

1217
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
They robbed the liquor store.

1218
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Like a helicopter like view of us.

1219
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Oh no!

1220
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
What was that?

1221
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I'm not a hippo.

1222
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Did he just kill us all?

1223
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Oh no, I don't have my hungry hungry hippo head.

1224
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
He's a good hippo.

1225
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Oh no.

1226
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
That was awesome.

1227
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Oh my goodness gracious.

1228
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Give us back hungry hungry hippo.

1229
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
This is so funny.

1230
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Alright, so this...

1231
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Oh, you should not shoot at the tires.

1232
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
That's our only vehicle.

1233
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Oh, I think that's a good note to end on, to be honest.

1234
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Seriously, that was...

1235
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
There was probably an admin in here or something.

1236
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I have no idea, but that was absolutely hysterical.

1237
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Hippo Burgers.

1238
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Alright, let me get on that bike.

1239
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Alright, wait, wait, here's how we're going to end it.

1240
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Here's how we're going to end it guys.

1241
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Everybody, everybody get into where we're standing right now.

1242
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
We're going to have a giant boxing match.

1243
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And the last man standing wins.

1244
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So don't not yet, no, take the knife, put the knife away.

1245
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Put the knife away.

1246
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Put the knife away.

1247
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So everyone get to where we're standing and no knives.

1248
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Only boxing.

1249
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So if we all, if we, ready?

1250
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
This is how it's going to end.

1251
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Make sure we get everybody here.

1252
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So this is how we're going to end it.

1253
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Wait, not yet, not yet.

1254
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Burgers, what's the real face?

1255
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Alright, wait, Burgers, stop it.

1256
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I don't think he's even like watching this stream.

1257
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Alright, ready?

1258
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So three, two, one.

1259
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Boxing fight, go.

1260
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Surely you're just disappeared.

1261
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I'm not over here punching people.

1262
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Oh, I'm going down.

1263
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I'm going down.

1264
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
No, I want to run.

1265
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I want to get on top of the car and like jumping punch.

1266
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
People are like running away.

1267
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh, he's going to say, low on health.

1268
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I love how nobody's even grunting or talking.

1269
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
So it's just like silence ready like.

1270
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm just like, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

1271
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Dude, gang up on Burger Boy, don't let him win.

1272
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Don't let Burger Boy win.

1273
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Gang up.

1274
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Burger Boy's dead.

1275
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Oh, I'm dead.

1276
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Oh, it's 4 health.

1277
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Did MLC stealth just win?

1278
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
No, did this guy win?

1279
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Oh, and you all win a hissing gem 2788.

1280
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Congratulations, you won the punching round.

1281
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And you know the win?

1282
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
A knife to the face.

1283
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Oh, now they're bringing out guns.

1284
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Oh, god.

1285
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Oh, man.

1286
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
That was awesome.

1287
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
That was amazing.

1288
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
So if you missed it, if you missed some of the, we've been playing for about just about an hour now.

1289
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Oh, if you missed, if you just got here or something, this is all going to be on YouTube tomorrow.

1290
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So there were some hysterical things that happened in this.

1291
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Like if you just joined us, you're going to want to watch, you're going to want to watch it tomorrow.

1292
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Okay.

1293
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
All right, it's time for some QWOP.

1294
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
That was a health, health, health, drama.

1295
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So what was my final death count?

1296
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
25?

1297
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Oh, god.

1298
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Wait, does it say?

1299
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
No, they've been counting in the stream.

1300
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I'm just looking over and glancing over and saying.

1301
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
All right, thanks a lot for playing, guys.

1302
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
If you played, I'll probably do this again.

1303
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
This was actually pretty damn fun.

1304
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
So thanks for coming.

1305
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
If you joined into the game and at the session.

1306
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So, oh, god.

1307
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So now we're going to play some QWOP.

1308
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And yeah, thanks so much, guys.

1309
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Oh.

1310
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Oh.

1311
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
That was a shot in the face.

1312
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
All right, let me pull up.

1313
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
How do I get out of here?

1314
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Leave game.

1315
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
All right, it's going to be a black screen until I get co-op loaded.

1316
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
QWOP.

1317
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Co-op, co-op, co-op, co-op.

1318
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Hey, yo.

1319
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Hey, yo.

1320
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I love Liberty City.

1321
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Co-op is a, it's like, it's a flash game.

1322
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It's a flash game where you have to use QW

1323
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
and then OP to run.

1324
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And it is incredibly difficult.

1325
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
So screens, actually screens probably not going to go black.

1326
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It's probably going to be just my background.

1327
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Yep.

1328
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Just my just top background.

1329
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
All right, let me pull up some co-op.

1330
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Let me make sure the screen thing is there.

1331
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Oh man, that was funny.

1332
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
That was so damn funny.

1333
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
QWOP, co-op, co-op, co-op.

1334
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Co-op.

1335
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1336
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I'm going to make it so it's just the QWOP screen,

1337
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
because that's more fun that way, black screen.

1338
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Ah!

1339
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Screen region.

1340
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
The QWOP screen.

1341
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

1342
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
How are you?

1343
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And let's fly.

1344
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So the goal.

1345
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Let me put myself a goal for this match.

1346
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It's round.

1347
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Slug, slug.

1348
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I'd say 10 meters.

1349
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I'm going to try and slug my way to at least 10 to 30.

1350
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Here we go.

1351
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1352
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Hold on a second.

1353
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I'm going to get my mixer here.

1354
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It's going to be a little too loud.

1355
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
All right, let's move.

1356
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah, TF2, I will do a TF2 stream next week, absolutely.

1357
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
But tonight, I was just running, I had a lot of work I had to do.

1358
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
So I just wanted to unwind with a little bit of GTA,

1359
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and that was a lot of fun.

1360
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And can I play League of Legends?

1361
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
That was one of the questions somebody was asking.

1362
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Me and stealth actually have played League of Legends.

1363
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
For like five minutes.

1364
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I'm just not that good, though.

1365
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I'm just so, I'm such a new bit that game.

1366
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And that's, oh no, God!

1367
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
No, that didn't count.

1368
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
That didn't count.

1369
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
That didn't count.

1370
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
This will though.

1371
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Oh, come on.

1372
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

1373
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I just finished GTA, Mr. A-D-Z-Y.

1374
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
If you want to check out my YouTube channel tomorrow,

1375
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
it'll be there, the whole thing.

1376
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Go, go, go.

1377
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I'm actually starting to kind of understand how this works.

1378
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Oh my God, how did I still...

1379
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Wow, okay, I'm good.

1380
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And Diablo, I'm gonna be...

1381
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
This is for those of you guys that are still here.

1382
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Diablo 3, I'm gonna be doing a lot of live streaming of that game.

1383
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
A lot of Diablo 3 streams are gonna happen.

1384
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So be on the lookout for those.

1385
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Alright, I gotta get to 30.

1386
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
C'mon, 30 meters.

1387
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Use your slug powers from the slug god of sluggington.

1388
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
You know what I wanna go to like a track in real life?

1389
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And see like just hopefully I'd see one guy just doing this.

1390
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Hey, what are you doing, man?

1391
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I have job training for the Olympics.

1392
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Like, oh good, you'll probably get there.

1393
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Keep trying, man.

1394
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Like just like slugging like, dude, what I did.

1395
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Go, go, go, go, go.

1396
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
30 meters, I'm gonna make it.

1397
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Oh, speaking of grandpa, the grandpa season one premiered tonight.

1398
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I'm gonna make it sweet about it, but it's all machin' him a respawn.

1399
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Go check it out.

1400
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
It's all machin' him a respawn right now.

1401
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Season two, episode one, the montage.

1402
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Go check it out.

1403
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I got a 10 out of 10.

1404
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Oh, 30 meters, I did it.

1405
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I did my goal.

1406
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Now I can...

1407
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Well, now I'm gonna try and actually run.

1408
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Alright, c'mon.

1409
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Put the bl- what about that?

1410
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
No, don't go backwards.

1411
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Let's see.

1412
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
So yeah, that's gonna be it guys.

1413
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Thanks for coming.

1414
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Thanks for sticking around for watching DTA.

1415
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
That was awesome.

1416
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And again, if you just came and you were like, oh no, it just ended.

1417
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It's gonna be there tomorrow on my YouTube channel.

1418
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So, yeah.

1419
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I will catch you guys all soon.

1420
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
One last try.

1421
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
C'mon.

1422
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Last try.

1423
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
C'mon, I'm gonna actually make it...

1424
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
No, c'mon.

1425
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
No, stay with it.

1426
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Stay one more.

1427
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Oh, no, one more after that.

1428
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I got in a groove last time.

1429
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I don't know how.

1430
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I got in that groove.

1431
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I'm like tiptoeing now.

1432
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
There we go.

1433
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Ah.

1434
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I had it.

1435
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I had it.

1436
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
One more.

1437
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
You gotta pull...

1438
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
You know what?

1439
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
The left leg has to come down.

1440
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Oh, that's it.

1441
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I can't do it.

1442
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
But yeah, thanks everybody so much for coming.

1443
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Thank you so, so, so, so much.

1444
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And I will catch you guys next time.

1445
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I'm actually stay tuned tonight to my channel

1446
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
because there's gonna be a...

1447
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
There's gonna be Minecraft, a new Minecraft video going up tonight.

1448
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Because I got a lot of requests for more of that Wush game.

1449
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
The theme, the theme, what am I talking about?

1450
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Wush!

1451
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Why can't I not say this?

1452
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I'm like having like a, like a seizure.

1453
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Wush!

1454
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Theme park.

1455
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Those, that's gonna go up tonight.

1456
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So, thank you so much for watching guys.

1457
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I'll see you guys all next time.

1458
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And of course, take care everybody.

1459
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
See ya, bye!

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's see if I can do it with Samson.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All fingers are pointing to no.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So let's go guys.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So sit.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Wait, why?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Why do I have a spirit heart?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm not exactly sure why that happened.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It should be right off the bat, but okay, so Samson works.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Every time you hit an enemy, you get stronger tears.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Like every 5-10 hits or something like that, you get stronger.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
See how I'm turning red?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I got like a pink kind of tinge to my body right now.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Means I'm doing a little bit more damage.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Every hit.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But as you can tell, he has only one heart, so it's just like, nope, you're going to die.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Why is envy in like the first room and the first level?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's just a lot of Malarkey if you ask me.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh my god, why is this guy blue?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It has like a grape.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hello from Alabama.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hello from Boston.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
City of Boston.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well I keep living in a good hit.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
City of hot dogs, right lights and a Boston Reds box.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh that didn't take forever.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Is it every kill?

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, it's every kill then.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So it can be pretty, if you get a lot of HP up, he can be pretty powerful.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But of course we're in the spider room, so I'm probably going to die right now.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh god, this is the worst.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If I die in this room, I swear.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I should have already been dead to be honest.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know where that spirit heart even came from.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I should be dead right now.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But I'm going to take it and stride.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You know what?

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I got a second chance.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's time to do this thing.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Alright, come on.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Come on you like cupcake.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You meat cupcake.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's get that item.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Have I met the scouting Boston?

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, I seem like riding his bike all the time.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He's always riding around wicked fast like a psycho.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, so he got buffed.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's what it is.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Alright.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What about Judas?

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So why would you ever play as Judas now?

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Isn't Judas have one heart or does he have two?

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If that's a buff, I can't think of a reason why you would ever play as anybody else.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, we're Judas at least.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Come on, blow up the secret room.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, I don't think I'm going to make it.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't think I'm going to do this.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yep, it's widow.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't think I'm going to do this, guys.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I might have to stock this over again.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, no, no way.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No way.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Not a chance.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Not a chance.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We're going to reach right.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Alright, hopefully I don't run into the spider boss again.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't think I will because we're not in the spider catacombe place right now.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, don't worry.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm not going to rage.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm not going to rage yet.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Getting shots.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Good, good, good, good.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Hey, it's always good to get your binding and Isaac deaths out of the way in the very

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
beginning, especially when you play on the stupid spider level.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's way too hot.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I think the spider level shouldn't be able to spawn until at least the second and third

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
rub because if you play it as a character like this, it's no way you're going to beat

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
that spider boss with one heart.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is no way.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I mean, I guess he could if you were really good.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Alright, doing much better.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's continue down here.

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, I was a little late today to the stream and that's because I actually went out last

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
night for the first time in a very long time and I got a little under the weather as they

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
say and woke up a little too late.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But should I get the key and get the crate?

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why am I saying crate?

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Too many games to crate lately.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, we're not going to do that yet.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't think it's worth it.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, unless you're like a character like Kane or even Isaac can probably do it.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
All the other...

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, Magdalene can do with Magdalene.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's keep going this way.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Look at that.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You bugs.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Whoa, didn't even see that guy.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I came out of nowhere.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I didn't even check my review mirror.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How could you ever delete the binding of Isaac?

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This game is too good.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Everything about this game is good.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Except there's one bad part about this game.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It has to end.

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Like when you're playing it has to be like over.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ooh, aces fades.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The aces fades.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, not doing that.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Not with Samson.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, let me walk over the spikes.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's a great idea.

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, I want that chest.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But I don't want that chest because it might be something not worth it.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Decisions, decisions.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, you know what, Yolo?

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You only live once.

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's do it.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm opening this chest.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
All right, give me something good.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't hit that habit, yeah.

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That was so worth it.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, well, you know what?

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You got to take risks sometimes.

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's not going to pay off.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's apparently...

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
All right, let's go and look at this guy's butt.

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
All right, Master-O.

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, two Master-O's.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's not a very good thing.

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And you got to fight two of the same Master-O.

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Come on, Burger Boy.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Come on, Burger Boy.

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, come on.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Why did it have to be Monstros?

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
They're just so happy.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I feel like these guys aren't even really trying to hurt me.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
They're just trying to play.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They're looking at them.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They're just like, hey, I just wanted to jump and throw up.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, God.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Well, one of them just go away.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Just go away.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come on.

144
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, my God.

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Um, that would be amazing.

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:16,000
GGUGFUGFUGFUGFUGFUGFUGFUGFUGFU ZoneB

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Right there.

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Ooh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do I have any bombs.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I do not have any bombs, so I got to just go.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Who is Bergeboy really?

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Bergeboy is one...

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, cursor darkness, this is...

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Bergeboy is one of my real-life good friends.

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And he's also crazy!

156
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But that's good. That's like a good quality.

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Because we're all crazy.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But Bergeboy is also the egg.

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And there's a...

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Might be a special video coming soon.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Coming soon, not like tomorrow, not like next week.

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But there might be the return of the egg.

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's the only thing I'm gonna say.

164
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The egg.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Best worst character ever.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Mm-hmm, what's this?

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The Emperor.

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Alright.

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Forget what you do.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But that's alright.

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You know, I actually-

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm actually one of those people that really liked Meet the Pyro.

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
A lot of people liked it, but a lot of people really didn't like it either.

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'll tell you one thing though, I think Meet the Pyro was too short.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If there's one complaint I have about Meet the Pyro, it was too short.

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Because I mean they gave us Meet the Spy, which was like three and a half minutes.

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Then they gave us Meet the Medic, which was like four minutes.

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And then it's like, oh man, they're getting crazier and crazier.

179
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Like more cinematic and more cinematic as they go.

180
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And then Meet the Pyro was like two minutes and 22 seconds.

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's the only complaint I have.

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Now I teleport you to the boss room. Good to know. Good to know.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I-

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Sorry, I must be crazy.

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I have another Spirit Heart.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Did I walk over one and just not even pay attention?

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Or do you- every time you kill like 20 people at Samson, you get a Spirit Heart?

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Maybe I'm just crazy.

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But I mean, after the inner- I think they could have done the interview stuff a little bit longer.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You know, when the Spy's like, what kind of inhumane just horrible disgusting thoughts sort of, he says,

191
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
if they fleshed that out a little bit more, maybe get a couple more characters like get the sniper to say some stuff.

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let's do it.

193
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm not going in that room.

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They blew the budget on the special effects.

195
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah.

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Get away from me.

197
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
He's gonna be hard to kill with this spoon.

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's gonna- oh no.

199
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's gonna like attack the- the things around him and not him.

200
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Sorry, I can wait it out.

201
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm also glad that the Pyro's gender is a secret to the couple of you guys that are saying that right now.

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't know, when you have a mystery like that, you gotta keep it a mystery.

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's just like when you read a book, right?

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If I read a book and it's like you don't know what the character looks like, you get to make up your own kind of version of the character.

205
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Because everybody has their own Pyro.

206
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I mean, and I'll bring up a friend of mine, Boo, you guys know Boo.

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Boo has like the best perfect description of the Pyro.

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's just like a cute, just like cuddly little entity that runs around and just has fun.

209
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Like that- that- that there is no man or woman.

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's just the Pyro.

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I think that's perfect.

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The Pyro is not a man or a woman, it is a thing.

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's just a- a mindset.

214
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's an entity.

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Okay.

216
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm absolutely not doing either of those.

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Ew, who reads books?

218
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I- I'm not missing, I gotta go.

219
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I gotta go down.

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I would use the Source Filmmaker.

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If I had any idea how to use it.

222
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The Source Filmmaker is one of those things where you really have to sit down and like play with it and be good with it and learn.

223
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And artistically, I was never really like an art student.

224
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I mean, I can- I went to School for Film.

225
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I could probably use it.

226
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I could probably like do like shots with it and stuff, but once you get to the animation part of things,

227
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
there's- there's no way I would ever know what to do with that program.

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Because I've tried Gary's mod, even just like do anted little dumb animations and little dumb things in Gary's mod.

229
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And they always end up as complete atrocities.

230
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Like complete and like just horrible things.

231
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Like, oh, I want to get like the heavy to smile and point his finger and he just ends up going like-

232
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Oh, get it!

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Like his hand comes up like-

234
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm just not good with art.

235
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I wish I was though.

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Midi-Greed.

237
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, no, please don't show me.

238
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Wow, wow.

239
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I was gonna say it. There's no way I'm that lucky.

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
To dodge like five of the cut.

241
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh my god, now I'm just being an idiot.

242
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's these stupid things that are in the way.

243
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I suppose I have homing shots. Come on now.

244
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, I hate Epic-Cack.

245
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I absolutely hate Epic-Cack, but I'm- I'm gonna take it.

246
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I really don't like Epic-Cack and it's probably gonna kill me, but you know what?

247
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm going to take it.

248
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
See if I can find the secret room.

249
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This is a full heart up here. Okay, this is too good to know.

250
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Oh, no, no, no, it's homing too.

251
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh my god, I forgot about that.

252
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh man, this is bad. This is really bad.

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This is really bad.

254
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm going to kill myself with this.

255
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Guaranteed, because it's homing.

256
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh my god.

257
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh no.

258
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh no.

259
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm blowing this up.

260
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Hmm, cool.

261
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah, this is definitely a run that is in the tank in my opinion.

262
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This is no way I'm gonna do this, because it's homing.

263
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I will open you though.

264
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh, I'm not- oh, it's over. Oh, it's over.

265
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Like a bit.

266
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm getting out of here.

267
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I can't believe I survived that.

268
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The only thing this is going to be good for is bosses. That's it.

269
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Barely, barely that.

270
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Hahaha.

271
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Oh.

272
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What did I have for dinner last night?

273
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I think I had a chicken sandwich.

274
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Pretty sure.

275
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Oh, wow.

276
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I can't believe I got hit by that.

277
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Hmm, this is taking so much longer, because I have to keep going back and healing myself.

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No, super secret room there.

279
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Super secret room is probably all the way to the right, if there is one here.

280
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh god.

281
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Super wrath, huh?

282
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I don't think I've never faced super wrath.

283
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh no, he does not do that.

284
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He does troll bombs?

285
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Like the big ones that follow you?

286
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I guess it doesn't matter, because he's dead.

287
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Starry's blast damage.

288
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Just blast damage.

289
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Incorporate.

290
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Uh, epic actions.

291
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hahaha.

292
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Oops.

293
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Why am I not watching the soccer finals?

294
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm not a big soccer guy.

295
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I never really was.

296
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I grew up on baseball.

297
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Baseball is my thing.

298
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Versus people.

299
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's Pete.

300
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh, well this might be like good.

301
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Maybe I'll like kill him easily with this epic act.

302
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh god.

303
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah, this is alright.

304
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm gonna be good.

305
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'll be good to go.

306
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Epic act.

307
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Oh god.

308
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Blink.

309
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'll take the tears up, even though I don't really want it.

310
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And...

311
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Let's go.

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, I'm definitely dead soon.

313
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I am absolutely dead soon.

314
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh, screw you.

315
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You aren't getting any of my hearts.

316
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You aren't getting my heart.

317
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Oh, it's...

318
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Dumped.

319
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Actually, that's not that bad.

320
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And why don't you just stay away from it?

321
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Favorite baseball team is the Boston Red Sox.

322
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I live in Boston, so.

323
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But I don't live in Boston.

324
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I live right next to it.

325
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Put it that way.

326
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Boy, ain't get smashed.

327
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Ah, no.

328
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh, no.

329
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
No, no.

330
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I can't shoot this.

331
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, come on.

332
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh, come on.

333
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This is the worst.

334
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
This is the worst.

335
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
This is the worst thing.

336
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Ah!

337
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What's this?

338
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Poison bomb school.

339
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Well, I think this is the end of Samson.

340
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Let's find out.

341
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Unless I get a heart right here.

342
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The Sun.

343
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Okay.

344
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I- I'm gonna stay alive.

345
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What's in this next room?

346
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Goodbye!

347
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Sorry.

348
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I was not dealing with that.

349
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Not a chance.

350
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm probably not gonna do a GTA IV.

351
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Let's play or walk through.

352
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
GTA V, though.

353
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I will probably do a some type of walkthrough.

354
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Maybe a Let's player or something.

355
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Because I love GTA games so much.

356
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I- I can't shoot that.

357
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Going here.

358
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Of course it's greed.

359
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Why else would it be anybody else but greed?

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
At least it's a steam seal.

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Mike Lowell is my favorite Red Sox player of all time.

362
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Mike Lowell.

363
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh.

364
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Epic hack.

365
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You are the worst.

366
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh, I've won that.

367
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's good for those guys.

368
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I will say that for sure.

369
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Oh!

370
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Okay.

371
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No, no, no.

372
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
No, get away.

373
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Good.

374
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm stuck.

375
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Get-

376
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I can't hit these bugs.

377
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Strike one. Strike two. Strike three. Strike four.

378
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Okay, there we go.

379
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm stuck.

380
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Alright boss.

381
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I am shocked that I've gotten this far.

382
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I am like legitimately shocked.

383
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You know what we're gonna do this already?

384
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Hey.

385
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What's going on?

386
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What's going on, buddy?

387
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
How you doing?

388
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You want like some of my hearts?

389
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Eat this!

390
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I missed.

391
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Eat this!

392
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Run.

393
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Who's talking to me?

394
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Getting tweets all over the place.

395
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Alright, let's fight this guy.

396
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh! Fantastic!

397
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Well, that was nice knowing you guys.

398
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm sure I'll be like in the afterlife as Samson.

399
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Maybe not.

400
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Maybe not.

401
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Wow!

402
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Alright.

403
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'll take that.

404
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'll take a swift victory.

405
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh, I want mommy.

406
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
First of the labyrinth, that's exactly what I wanted.

407
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm glad.

408
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh no.

409
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh boy.

410
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Oh my god.

411
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh my god.

412
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Oh my god.

413
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I can't even handle this right now.

414
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah. Well, now the jig is up.

415
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Unless I pull off some real, real ridiculous moves.

416
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I am not doing this.

417
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Oh, bombs are key.

418
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I actually would rather have that, thank you.

419
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
This could be the end right here.

420
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm gonna probably say.

421
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Time to be quiet.

422
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Go to try hard mode and not scream when I die.

423
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Because that's probably what I'm gonna do!

424
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Hmm.

425
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Oh my god.

426
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh my god.

427
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Oh my god.

428
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh my god.

429
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Alright, okay.

430
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
As long as you take it slow and steady.

431
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Just like the turtle.

432
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You don't gotta be the hair.

433
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Okay, but now.

434
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Oh no.

435
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Oh.

436
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh.

437
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
D.

438
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Alright.

439
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It hurts every time playing this game.

440
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I might want to just go.

441
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't know.

442
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I don't know.

443
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I really have one heart.

444
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
No, I'll die.

445
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I need more stuff.

446
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That's not what I needed.

447
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm afraid to even attempt to get in here.

448
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Oh my god.

449
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You know what was gonna happen?

450
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I just, I got it, I got it over with.

451
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I got it over with her purpose.

452
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,000
How come that killed me, by the way?

453
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I thought it only did, uh...

454
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I thought it only did one half heart.

455
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Why did I die from that?

456
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Oh, whatever.

457
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Let's just go straight up Isaac.

458
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Isaac never did me wrong.

459
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Samson, you're too hard.

460
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
With your no hearts.

461
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm gonna take this game by the horns with Isaac.

462
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Attack flying, it's gonna start.

463
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm gonna beat this right now.

464
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You see that, that just, that just maybe so sad that I'm gonna beat this now.

465
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I got the key, alright?

466
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Okay.

467
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Come on flies, what do you gotta get, Isaac?

468
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
What?

469
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Speaking about those spikes again, I swear that I mean I had one heart.

470
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Why would it do more than one heart worth of damage?

471
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Maybe they changed it, or maybe I'm just not smart enough to understand.

472
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Oh yeah, keep throwing your bugs at me and then you run them over yourself.

473
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Isaac!

474
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Actually, I'd rather stay up here, keeping from moving around so much.

475
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Whoa!

476
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Wow!

477
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
There you go, kill your own dudes.

478
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
That's what I like to say.

479
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Now that's what I like to say, son.

480
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Not that though.

481
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Get away!

482
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Whoa!

483
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Dodge and board to your...

484
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Come on, you can hit me.

485
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You can do better than that.

486
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Keep me.

487
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Jump!

488
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Alright, I'm smoking this game.

489
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm gonna smoke this whole game right now.

490
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
As the title character, as Isaac.

491
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Screw that thing, I don't want it.

492
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Bam!

493
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I wish they would come up with Binding of Isaac 2 and have it be like not single player.

494
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Have it be you can have more than one or two people in the game, or probably two, more than two will be ridiculous.

495
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Alright, let's go.

496
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Cutcake.

497
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You velvet cutcake batter.

498
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Speed and range up.

499
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And I look like a freaking psycho.

500
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Nickel.

501
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Alright, got a nickel.

502
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Good to go.

503
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Let's go, you uncooked chicken.

504
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You can't kill me.

505
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I think a boo was telling me that he won 100% of this game.

506
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Which, like, that's incredible.

507
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
What a boss.

508
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's a burn and it's not an easy feat to complete like everything in this game.

509
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It really isn't.

510
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:12,000
See, you like use it on the secret room, which is probably right here.

511
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Well, apparently it wasn't right there.

512
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Probably was down this hall somewhere.

513
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But you know, I can take it, whatever.

514
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
My favorite holiday is definitely Halloween.

515
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I love Halloween more than anything.

516
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The only time of the year where you are allowed to be a freak show.

517
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And like nobody is, he cares or gets mad.

518
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Think of any other night, the entire year, where you are allowed to hang out you a car window

519
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
as the Joker and scream and laugh at random like old people on the street.

520
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
When can you do that and people just go, oh, he's just being fun.

521
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
There's not another time in the world where you can do that.

522
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Oh, you're gonna curve your bullets too, huh?

523
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Curve the bullets.

524
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Angerly to jelly.

525
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
That's every day for me.

526
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Mad killer.

527
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Oh, the dark knight from here.

528
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I guess that is the situation where you couldn't do that.

529
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Oh, welcome to the dark knight from here.

530
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Like, oh, okay.

531
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You can be the Joker and scream at people.

532
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That's awesome.

533
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I kind of feel like an ice cream cone right now.

534
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I feel like a big ice cream cone.

535
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Oh, boy.

536
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
These guys aren't that bad.

537
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I can handle these guys.

538
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I can handle these two dudes.

539
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Oh, if you're wondering, someone was asking about Team Fortress

540
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
and how come I'm not streaming it or anything.

541
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm still waiting for a fix.

542
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And I think there's a beta driver right now for the 670.

543
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Oh, the 600 series in general.

544
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm gonna download that and try it.

545
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I didn't want to spend like an hour or two troubleshooting

546
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
when I was already like an hour late to the stream anyways.

547
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So next week we will see what happens with that.

548
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
But for right now, Larry, Jr.

549
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You're dead.

550
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And you're not coming back as much as you want to.

551
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
As much as you want to be in your like fruit punch pool.

553
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

554
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,000
See, this is looking more and more like a clean run every single time.

555
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Let's go.

556
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Four hearts full.

557
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I got no stamps of night to worry about.

558
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You need to die, man.

559
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You are a persistent son of a...

560
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I kept hitting that guy in the face and he just kept going like,

561
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

562
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I get out of my face, man.

563
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I can't have my face.

564
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Do I play MMOs?

565
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Absolute freaking loot.

566
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I played World of Warcraft for over six years.

567
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I had multiple max level characters.

568
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
My main was a warlock.

569
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Well, actually, let me refresh that.

570
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Warrior.

571
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I was a priest and then it was a warlock and my main was the warlock for the most amount of time.

572
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But I had a priest warrior warlock through it.

573
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
God, I had like everything in that game.

574
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
But then they did a bunch of weird changes.

575
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I don't know why.

576
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
They did a lot of changes.

577
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Oh, it's lagging right now.

578
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Streams lagging?

579
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
What's going on here?

580
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Are we good?

581
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I hope so.

582
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It just popped up like everybody was like,

583
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
like, lag, lag, lag.

584
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Like my stream is on fire right now.

585
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So apparently my stream is like in flames.

586
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Try refreshing it.

587
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Try refreshing it up.

588
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Let's see.

589
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Just to make sure I, because a lot of you guys were just saying that it was lagging.

590
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Let's take a look here.

591
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Look at my stream health to make sure it's okay.

592
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Life control room.

593
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It'll tell you it'll be like, oh, your stream is lagging like crazy.

594
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It says it's okay.

595
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So it seems better now.

596
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
That's good.

597
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That's a good thing.

598
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
All right.

599
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Well, I apologize about that.

600
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Sorry.

601
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Somebody just like rolled over and like tripped over my stream code at YouTube somewhere.

602
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And they like to plug it back in real quick.

603
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Somebody was eating a sandwich and they just like tripped like,

604
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm going to hit the clean and ripped up my stream code.

605
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Oh, oh.

606
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah, if you're still getting the lag trying to refresh, sometimes that fixes it.

607
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It shouldn't be happening to begin with though.

608
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,000
My favorite superhero is, ah, that is a tough question.

609
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Because there are a lot.

610
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
There are a lot that I could say.

611
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh, my God. This room is full of bugs.

612
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Man, I don't want to say like, oh, Batman.

613
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Because it really isn't Batman.

614
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Or Superman.

615
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
What is his name?

616
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I should be able to answer this question in three seconds.

617
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I don't know why I can't answer this.

618
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Super hero.

619
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Deadpool.

620
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Deadpool. There you go.

621
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Probably Deadpool.

622
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Deadpool or Venom?

623
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
That took me a long time to say that.

624
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I need more coins.

625
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
A-SAP.

626
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm going to buy this bomb and try to blow up the secret room. See if it's right here.

627
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But Venom is just such a cool character.

628
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I love the way he is.

629
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
He's just Venom.

630
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
No, that was a wrong place. It was up top. God, dude.

631
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Alright, whatever.

632
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Let's go.

633
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Girty.

634
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I actually like facing Girty. I can handle him.

635
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I can handle Girty.

636
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Girty, come on.

637
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
D'oh, I did not dodge that right at all.

638
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm going to go.

639
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Uh-oh, you two like bubbles of puke.

640
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Gotta get rid of those bubbles of puke.

641
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I know on Deadpool because at the Deadpool comics, have you ever read them?

642
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
He is insane.

643
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
He breaks the fourth wall all the time. He'll just be like, hey, reader.

644
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
If you want to like skip this part, go ahead and like go to page 14.

645
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
This part's like pretty boring.

646
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I just talked to some broad for like five minutes.

647
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I love how much he breaks the fourth wall.

648
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And the Deadpool comics. It's so funny.

649
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Alright, Girty.

650
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
That just about enough of you.

651
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And you are like big, smelly body.

652
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Oh, come on. You're going to do me like that, Girty.

653
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I keep thinking that eye is not mine and that happens every time.

654
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You would again.

655
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I'm not doing it again, I dare you. I dare you.

656
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh, you messed. You stupid.

657
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Go.

658
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
The caves.

659
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Welcome to the caves.

660
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Down here, you'll never see the light of day again.

661
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And you almost die from fucking into things.

662
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:04,000
What you know, Isaac.

663
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I actually, when Vindictus first came out, I was, it's free to play, right?

664
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I actually was going to download that and I just forgot to do it.

665
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So thank you for reminding me because I'm going to go download Vindictus like right after the stream is done.

666
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
That's the one where it's like an MMO, but it's like a hack and slash kind of like third person.

667
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
That's the right game, I think it is right.

668
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'll take that money.

669
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Go ahead, blow up. I'll take that money.

670
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's going here.

671
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Now what do you have for me?

672
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
If you don't have, if I don't win this in the first time, you are dying just to let you know.

673
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Alright, I know you heard me.

674
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Do you want to공stale? I will find out.

675
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Oh, looks like somebody wants to get blown up.

676
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
No, please, no, please!

677
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Yeah, couldn't even finish your sentence.

678
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And that's enough of that.

679
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

680
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah, definitely downloading Ben Dick to the end of this stream.

681
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And I'm going to play it.

682
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
It's a bunch.

683
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Oh, you turned into like a little piece of jello.

684
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I feel bad for you.

685
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm doing it.

686
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
No, it wasn't worth it for like the seventh time in a row.

687
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It's never worth it.

688
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Me and MLC stealth played DC Universe for a little while.

689
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
We played for like a few hours at least.

690
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
A few more cracking my back.

691
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Hours, at least.

692
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Of course it's great.

693
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Of course it's great.

694
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Why would it be anybody else besides Greed?

695
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Get him eyeball.

696
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Show him that...

697
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So I just realized something.

698
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I am shooting a red tear every other tear.

699
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Is that because my eye came home?

700
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Yeah, it has to be, right?

701
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Ugh, Greed, you bastard.

702
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Why don't you go bother like Edward Alrich?

703
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Leave me alone.

704
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Never mind, you dropped a lot of money.

705
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I like you, no.

706
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
What am I doing standing there?

707
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I need to be in the corner.

708
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I need to be in the rear view.

709
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
There we go.

710
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Don't even need to do that.

711
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Uh-oh, it's super toothless Joe, whatever his name is.

712
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
These guys freak me out.

713
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
These guys are scary.

714
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I've had all the Warhammer games for a pretty long time.

715
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
If you are a fan of RTS,

716
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I highly recommend you get the original Dawn of War.

717
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I wasn't a fan of Don of War II.

718
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm not gonna lie.

719
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I thought Don of War II was a good game,

720
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
but I don't think it was nearly as good as Don of War I.

721
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Just quit following me, dude.

722
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Come on, come right here.

723
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Come on, come on.

724
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I've got like candy and soda and chips.

725
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
You know what, you're not gonna come down,

726
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
but you're gonna kill you.

727
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
We're gonna have a party down there,

728
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
but you like didn't feel like I'm...

729
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and that makes me sad.

730
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
There we go.

731
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
How much for? There we go.

732
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Item room is all the way over there.

733
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
After this, I'm gonna have to go do that.

734
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Get to the item room.

735
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
After all these toothless freaks.

736
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
There we go.

737
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Oh!

738
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Ooh, speaking of Lepardad 2,

739
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
someone just said Lepardad 2.

740
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Didn't they come out with a new map,

741
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Cold Stream, or Cold Land or something?

742
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Because whatever it is, I'm definitely gonna be playing a lot of that too.

743
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Fork.

744
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Isaac's fork.

745
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Okay.

746
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Oh, if you're gonna come to the party,

747
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
you're gonna bring like Salsa,

748
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
you're gonna bring dip, chips,

749
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
soda,

750
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
burga patties,

751
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
frozen hot dogs,

752
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
a love for life,

753
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and a good attitude.

754
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
That's the only way you're allowed my party.

755
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Tudy.

756
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You sack of mobiles to get out of here.

757
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Open.

758
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Open.

759
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Now open again.

760
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm the dentist.

761
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And your teeth need a real cleaning.

762
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Where's this item room?

763
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Oh my god.

764
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Such a big level.

765
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
This is dumb.

766
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Oh my goodness, will you just...

767
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I need to damage up something.

768
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Because it's taking forever to kill any of these things.

769
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Open.

770
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Open.

771
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Yeah, once it comes out,

772
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I'll stream Lepardad 2.

773
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Once the new map comes out.

774
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Open.

775
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I didn't even kill him.

776
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
My little buddy did.

777
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Ooh,

778
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
little Chad.

779
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
He's so happy.

780
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Hi, I'm bro Chad.

781
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I'm gonna drop Hatch for you.

782
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Thanks little Chad.

783
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Jump, no problem.

784
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It's a little Chad.

785
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You're gonna like tell me your life story.

786
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Good day, sir.

787
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I grew up in dishever,

788
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
and then I pulled out Hatch.

789
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
That's a touching story, Chad.

790
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Thank you.

791
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Now give me your hearts before I kill myself.

792
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Because I'm like pretending to be two people.

793
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Okay.

794
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Well, that's a good way to like lose three hearts.

795
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Like do like a little Chad movie.

796
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Pills here.

797
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
No, no, it's the worst.

798
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
That's the last thing I wanted.

799
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Buh, buh.

800
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah, I got it.

801
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
There is a circus following me right now.

802
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Look at this.

803
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Like,

804
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da dahow

805
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
All I need now is brother Bobby.

806
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And like more tack flies,

807
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,000
and I'll be all set.

808
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Hopefully I don't die.

809
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Oh.

810
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Chad.

811
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Oh no.

812
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Why is he so weak?

813
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Was that my...

814
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
What just even cured him?

815
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I didn't do that.

816
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Hopefully he doesn't kill me.

817
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
All right, little Chad and Big Chad.

818
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
This is like very surreal.

819
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
He's fighting his like daddy right now.

820
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
This is like weird.

821
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Who side of you on, son?

822
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I stand on the side of light.

823
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
What's in here?

824
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I'm actually kind of tempted to take this.

825
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Because I could use the spirit hearts.

826
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I think I'm going to take that.

827
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I really think I'm going to take this right now.

828
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Oh, I'm going to take it.

829
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I'm going to take it.

830
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I took it.

831
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Thank you.

832
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I was a decision I had to make, and I made it.

833
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I needed it.

834
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Oh god.

835
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I'm like, why is it crashing?

836
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
What?

837
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
What?

838
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Oh.

839
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
For a second there, I thought the game was just crashed and done.

840
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I was just about to freak out.

841
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Did my stream die?

842
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
You're still streaming, right?

843
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Okay, you guys saw that.

844
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It was just like...

845
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You know what?

846
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
We might even do it again at some point if I need it.

847
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Oh, pro dodges right there.

848
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Pro dodging.

849
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I wish there wasn't all these obstacles in the way, so I could hit them.

850
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Oh.

851
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Oh, that thing was blocking it.

852
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
That was why.

853
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Give me this.

854
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Give me that.

855
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And I'm going to blow this up for sure.

856
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Good position.

857
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Now, too bad I have stupid curse of the labyrinth.

858
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Whatever this dumb thing does.

859
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I think it makes it like I can't see anything.

860
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Oh, I want to kill at least mom.

861
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I want to kill mom.

862
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
That big fat...

863
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Oh.

864
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
There we go.

865
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Let's go down.

866
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I just did this room, man.

867
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I just did this room.

868
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Okay, I'm going the other way.

869
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I'm going around.

870
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Oh.

871
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
There's too much stuff blocking you from me to shoot you.

872
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
See, if I didn't take that guppies hand, I didn't use it.

873
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I probably would be dead right now.

874
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Because I've been hitting at least five or six times.

875
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Oh, this is bad.

876
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Oh, this is really bad, especially this room.

877
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Don't spawn anymore.

878
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
No, no.

879
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Get...

880
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
God.

881
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I hate spiders.

882
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Not only in real life, but in fake life, too.

883
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
That's a good thing to take.

884
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Gappy.

885
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Die.

886
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Oh, you hairy...

887
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
No, this is going to be so...

888
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I was going to stay in the corner.

889
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
No sense going out there and meeting my demise like that.

890
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Get out of here.

891
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Oh, no.

892
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Corner's bad move.

893
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Oh, it's gone.

894
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
There has to be this many things in this room.

895
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Get out of here, you bum-bomb.

896
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Duh.

897
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
There's so many of these little guys that shoot.

898
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I hate those ones.

899
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I actually just tried to Samson Run.

900
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Didn't really work out too well.

901
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I got to like...

902
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
What, the third or fourth Roman I died?

903
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Oh, come on.

904
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I don't want any of your like cream cheese.

905
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Get out of here.

906
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
This is the binding of Isaac, Wrath of the Lamb, DLC.

907
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And this is me getting stuck in not being able to...

908
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Oh, my God.

909
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I had to use it.

910
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I had to do that.

911
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You guys all saw it.

912
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I had to do that.

913
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I might even have to do it again.

914
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I'm going to have to do it again.

915
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I'm going to have to do it again.

916
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Oh my God, I'm going to have to do it again.

917
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Oh my God, I'm going to have to do it again.

918
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Oh my God.

919
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Oh my God, no.

920
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
There's no way for me to go.

921
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Oh, there was no way for me to go.

922
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Oh my God.

923
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
There was literally nothing I could do right there,

924
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
besides just get hit a million times.

925
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Oh, now it is definitely over.

926
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Oh, these...

927
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Come on.

928
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Okay, well, that's going to be the end of this run.

929
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Hopefully you enjoyed this.

930
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Have fun and whatever you're going to do.

931
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Oh, and then how have you...

932
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
What path you take in your life?

933
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I'm silent.

934
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
God.

935
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Oh, that was the worst possible thing that could happen.

936
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
No order on, no to hide.

937
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
No order on.

938
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
They were like engulfing me.

939
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Oh my God, started it.

940
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Hmm.

941
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Well, that's...

942
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So now you know what's going to happen.

943
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
His grandpa is going to play his question mark, question mark, question mark.

944
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And that's going to be the end of the stream.

945
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
So I'm going to go get grandpa.

946
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Grandpa can come in and he'll sit down.

947
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
He'll talk about how he loves this game.

948
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And we'll see what happens.

949
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Hey grandpa!

950
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Hey, you got to get down here.

951
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
You got to play Binding of Isaac right now.

952
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
No, come get it, get it, come down.

953
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You're scaring the dog, just come down.

954
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Okay, let me just get it over here.

955
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
What, what the hell is this game?

956
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
What game is this?

957
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Binding of Isaac.

958
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
What's that?

959
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Just play it.

960
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Just sit down and play.

961
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Okay, I said, there.

962
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Ready, there we go.

963
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Okay, hello, let's play the Binding of Isaac.

964
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
What is it?

965
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Did I just eat shit?

966
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
What the hell was that?

967
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Now I said, what are the controls of this game?

968
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Up, down, left, right.

969
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Okay, so here we go.

970
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Up, down, left, right.

971
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Okay, good.

972
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Let's go this way.

973
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
What's it?

974
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
That's a spider, this game is stupid.

975
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
What a dumb game.

976
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
So you want you to just kill spiders and that's it.

977
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
This is stupid.

978
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Why would you ever play this game?

979
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Okay, let's keep going.

980
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
What's that?

981
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
What's the hell?

982
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Oh, that hurts you.

983
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Oh, am I going to die?

984
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Let's just go.

985
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Okay, I'm going to beat this entire game right now.

986
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Let's go down.

987
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Okay, we're going to go down here.

988
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Look, look, I'm driving like a farm right here.

989
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
A pet spider is okay.

990
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Hey, spiders.

991
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So today I'm going to feed you some little bugs that you're going to eat them.

992
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Again, I'll just shoot that.

993
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
So how do I, is this like a simulator?

994
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
How do I get out of here?

995
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
What, what have I escaped?

996
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
What have I escaped?

997
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
What have I escaped?

998
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
What have I escaped?

999
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
That means you die, by the way.

1000
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
If you escape to hold, that means you die, you bastard.

1001
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
See, these guys are locked in here forever.

1002
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Can you get out of here?

1003
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
How about trying to get down?

1004
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
You're not getting anywhere.

1005
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I'm going to shoot that jet out of you.

1006
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
You can't even do it.

1007
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
That's it.

1008
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I got the key.

1009
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I'm going to go in the golden room, the golden palace,

1010
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
and pick up the lazy beam.

1011
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
What?

1012
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
What is this deal?

1013
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Is this a shoot right to a people?

1014
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
So what's this practice deal?

1015
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Oh yeah, you.

1016
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Ew.

1017
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
This game is gross.

1018
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
No, I take money.

1019
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I love the money.

1020
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I absolutely love money.

1021
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It's the best thing in the world.

1022
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Whoa, that was an explosion.

1023
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
We're going down to this room.

1024
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Okay.

1025
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Did I miss anything?

1026
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Do I have to go back up here?

1027
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Or something?

1028
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
What the hell is this?

1029
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
What is this?

1030
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Oh my god, this guy's...

1031
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
What is this guy?

1032
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Can I help you?

1033
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I'm going to get him down.

1034
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I'm going to get him down off that rope.

1035
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
He's going to die.

1036
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Oh, whatever.

1037
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Scroll you.

1038
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Let's scroll down here.

1039
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And this is the room I need to go in right?

1040
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Oh, I have to fight this little worm.

1041
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So what?

1042
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Do I just...

1043
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Do I have to go out there?

1044
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
How many lives do I get?

1045
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I get like ten lives, right?

1046
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Like two at least, two at least three lives, right?

1047
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
What is...

1048
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Where's the other stuff that's all over again?

1049
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
You don't get lives and you don't get lives in this game?

1050
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Is that what you're trying to tell me right now?

1051
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
How can I don't have...

1052
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
This is the stupidest game I've ever played!

1053
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
How...

1054
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Why would...

1055
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
This is the time...

1056
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
You know what?

1057
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I'm not going to do anything.

1058
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I'm going right back to that same boss.

1059
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Got worms out of a bitch.

1060
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
He's going down right now.

1061
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Hey, worm!

1062
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Is a different guy.

1063
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Why is it...

1064
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
What's the worm?

1065
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
The worm looked a lot easier than this guy.

1066
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
What is it?

1067
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Is this whole game just like randomly generated?

1068
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Is it stupid?

1069
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm going to punch him in the face.

1070
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I'll punch you!

1071
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I'm going to punch you right in your face!

1072
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
You see, that's how you're doing.

1073
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
That's a pro tip right there.

1074
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
See all those bugs that were around him?

1075
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
They're not there anymore, aren't they?

1076
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
See, I'll do it again!

1077
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Get rid of them!

1078
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Stupid goddamn bugs!

1079
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And that's how you win.

1080
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
That's how you beat this.

1081
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I'll pull on them too.

1082
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And that's how you get the most massive points.

1083
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Can't take trait.

1084
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Can't take trait.

1085
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Need to concentrate!

1086
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Oh, I don't have enough life to do in a bug move again.

1087
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I don't have enough life to do in a bug move.

1088
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And you know what?

1089
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
He's not my son.

1090
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm going to beat the game.

1091
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I just beat the game.

1092
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I just beat the game.

1093
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I just beat the game.

1094
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
This game's supposed to be on.

1095
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Just...

1096
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Just...

1097
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
But do it again.

1098
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
We'll go on the drill again.

1099
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Go.

1100
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Get out of my way.

1101
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Get out of my way!

1102
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Just...

1103
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Just give me a stick.

1104
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
You know.

1105
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
See you right up.

1106
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
If you play that game,

1107
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
you're at the center of a bitch in my opinion.

1108
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And we're not friends anymore.

1109
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
But I'll get that here.

1110
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Stop chucking me, you rude guy.

1111
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Die, slide up.

1112
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Hello?

1113
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
You see, um...

1114
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Did he die?

1115
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
What am I doing?

1116
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Oh, I'm going to put these headphones back in.

1117
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I mean, he still has a heart left.

1118
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It's not like he didn't die completely.

1119
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Why is he playing as this guy, by the way?

1120
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
All right.

1121
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Uh, let's salvage the grandpa run.

1122
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
It's going to be impossible.

1123
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Oh, poor grandpa.

1124
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Don't worry, he'll get over it.

1125
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Grandpa rages all the time.

1126
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
He'll get over it.

1127
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Ten bombs.

1128
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And he died three times.

1129
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Make it four, because I'm probably not going to make it out of this room.

1130
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Nope.

1131
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Oh, there's no way.

1132
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
There's no way.

1133
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Like, there's not a chance.

1134
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Ding, ding, ding, ding, and that's the... right there.

1135
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Well, that's going to wrap it up, guys.

1136
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Thanks, everybody, so much for coming.

1137
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
This will all be on YouTube in the next...

1138
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
...like half an hour or so, so if you missed it from the beginning...

1139
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
...didn't really do any good runs.

1140
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Unfortunately, it wasn't a good night for Isaac.

1141
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
So...

1142
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
But that's okay, head phone regardless.

1143
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So thanks, everybody, again, for coming so much.

1144
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
You guys all rock and roll.

1145
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And I will see you guys all soon.

1146
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
So take care, everybody.

1147
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And let's end this dream.

1148
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Oh, and grandpa just says goodbye, too, and that he loves you all.

1149
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Right, grandpa?

1150
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Oh, and he's coming in here, hold on.

1151
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Grandpa, get in here.

1152
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
You need to apologize to these people.

1153
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I apologize, everybody.

1154
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Okay, I'm sorry.

1155
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I'm really sorry, you know.

1156
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Rage takes over us all.

1157
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
And the game was just a little too hard.

1158
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
But I love everybody.

1159
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I hope you guys have a fantastic Sunday...

1160
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
...and...

1161
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
...gloved grandpa.

1162
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And goodbye, that's it, goodbye.

1163
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Now we're gonna eat in my 10 minutes.

1164
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
You gotta have a paycheater.

1165
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Let's go.

1166
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I bring you a dog, too.

1167
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I'm gonna feed her.

1168
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
All right, see you later.

1169
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
So that's gonna be the end, guys.

1170
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Thanks a lot for watching.

1171
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I really do appreciate it.

1172
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And of course, again, take care, everybody.

hey look it there we are

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:27,000
all right so what's the reason that I'm wondering what this is we're gonna just

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
just just sit here and enjoy this song I'm gonna enjoy this music is this the

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,000
like a rory music let me try it a little bit more you're about to play sport all right

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
well you can you listen to this how does this sound I thought you did the

56
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I thought you could have played mobile games no not today not it sounds it sounds

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
better now okay okay so Armour Crog if you don't know what what this is we'll

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
give a brief synopsis of this before we actually start playing the game this is

59
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
one of my favorite games of all time was a neverhood came out like 20 years

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
ago it's a claymation game it's a point and click you walk around you interact with

61
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
stuff is a lot of dialogue and this is the the guys it made Armour Crog I mean

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the guy that made neverhood made this game this was a kickstarter game and it's

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
really awesome because the guys that made the original game came together finally

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
after a long time to make a new one so hopefully they still have like every

65
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
they still have the passion and they still have the creativity like they did 20

66
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:11,000
years ago so we're gonna sit here for another five minutes maybe I'll turn up

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:22,000
the sound like during the cutscene maybe that should be better yeah yeah I was

68
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
listening to the volume yeah everything in general seems fine it's all a little

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
low people say I could barely hear but they don't understand that there's a

70
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
volume slider on the website twitch that television I'd look on the lower left

71
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
hand side of your screen you're gonna see a thing that looks like an old

72
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
tiny old-fashioned speaker that's not actually what speakers are really looking

73
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
like nowadays anymore but they still use that to help people understand you know

74
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
the same way there's a telephone all right so let's to cut you off this game

75
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
requires a pen and paper and I'm gonna say this right now I ain't speed running

76
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
this game I'm not going through this fast I want to enjoy this because I've been

77
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
waiting for like 20 years for this game to come up so I I might take a little

78
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
while in some places I might want to listen to songs and stuff like that so if

79
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
you're one of those people that's just like get on with it and do the puzzle

80
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
what are you doing you're probably not gonna you're probably gonna want to

81
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
just hang tight because this game is going to be like a chill I'm just gonna

82
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
play and run and hack up my little note pad here I could have scribbled some notes

83
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
on it and stuff you know how it is

84
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
yeah how many people are here like four like showed up I think you turned the

85
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
volume up by maybe just like the in-game volume you know like 10% boost then

86
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
no there's there's there's 10%

87
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
we're looking we're looking quite keen you know oh but you better not talk to

88
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
any cutscenes if you speak during a cutscene I am just going to end I'm gonna

89
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
end the call I'm I'm just gonna get out of here the only thing I'm gonna say

90
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
during a cutscene that I'm not saying anything

91
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
all right so here we go that's your answer yeah I got my pen I got my paper I

92
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000

93
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000

102
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
there could be Carpacian rain stuckers

103
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:42,000
here we are beakeake what is this place got me I know this looks too hard I think I'd

104
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
stop here actually but I'm gonna do this because it probably would be a good idea

105
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:00,000
let's turn on some subtitles that probably helped all right so this is me there's

106
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Tommy not there's little dog okay I can click on the dog and move the dog around so you

107
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
control two characters in this game all right interesting well let's go pick up this

108
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
take a look outside yeah I am a little louder no no whatever I don't worry about it man

109
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
what the hell was that

110
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:42,000
haha all right I got I got to pay attention because the these guys the neverhood guys they put

111
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
random weird clues that you'll need like four hours from now in these rooms in these first

112
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
rooms if I remember from the last game there's a lot of wacky shit so

113
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
just take a look at some of the stuff over here I mean that was that was 20 years ago do you

114
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
think you're gonna need to know the information from 20 years ago that'd be cool if you did

115
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and I can't click on this from the back of the box the cell number that looks like that looks

116
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:18,000
like a dog hole but you know okay I just bought here there we go okay easiest pie

117
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:31,000
this room is so cool I am gonna apologize in advance like I'm gonna take in every single room

118
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
what is that is that a piece of cheese it's like a fuzzy piece of cheese

119
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I knew you'd come you've traveled far yet your true journey begins through the exit unseen

120
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
okay anything else know this to open one door you must block another

121
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:12,000
as the beast blocks your entrance your exit shall appear okay can I do anything over here

122

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
what's that what did I just eat

135
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
shit I should have paid attention with the way I just ate something I don't know what the hell it was

136
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm gonna come out the doggy door right yeah first control I there's another symbol right

137
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
this one down there's another symbol what I wait a hold on a second

138
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
uh it's a box

139
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,000
all right a little swirly in the middle and then two squares next to it

140
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
can you do it can you do anything else can I go walk in now this door is closed

141
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
jelly roll that's a good day for it yeah jelly roll looks like the end of an arm chair

142
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
yes me dude kind of does he's not tall enough to grab that but

143
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:44,000
okay I got another symbol though so that's good to know now is this because the light is on

144
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
what are the lights off because I don't think I can switch back to Tommy not

145
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
what happens if I turn let's put the light on and try that again but

146
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
oh he just puked up a lever oh shit

147
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
uh I just ate it again

148
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
what does the second lever go oh no this you okay there's a lever in this next room

149
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
over here I remember I remember there it is

150
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:37,000
so that opens that door that door I couldn't open before I can push this fuzzy guy I love this character by the way

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
the fuzzy guy yeah well what what the fuck

155
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I kind of feel like I need to click this greetings friend I am Abraham Lincoln

156
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
one two

157
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
there was one two one two three one I'm gonna see that again hold on

158
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Ant Lincoln

159
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
two three one okay Ant Lincoln

160
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:42,000
two three one was there anything else in there what what what what what what what what should

161
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:51,000
what one two three four five lines I have no idea what this means I'm sure maybe the

162
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
later I'll figure it out what's the significance you think of him being the tallest American

163
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
president um white quite the stature even without the other top idol for James Madison

164
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
James Madison five four really didn't stand up to anything Abraham Lincoln had accomplished

165
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I say politicians have to be tall I think you're gonna have to be tall to do one of these puzzles

166
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
yeah yeah I'm not I don't think I'm tall enough to do this puzzle

167
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:32,000
well this obviously correlates to the ant guy so I mean I see a couple top charts on that top

168
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:44,000
row you're scrolling by any of these symbols guard chair was on the top row yeah I thought it

169
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
was two but does that mean anything this is the only role that's lit up

170
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
well can't you push them down who's the ups and the downs yeah I guess oh yeah I can

171
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
shell okay yeah cool geez I guess I guess I have to make what you do without me so let's let's

172
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,000
try to make the uh the jelly roll right well can I do I don't think I even will hold on

173
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:23,000
there any more swords too

174
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm gonna come back to this in a second I want to go down to

175
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I want to look at this one more thing because I want to turn the light on and let him go down

176
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:53,000
go down there can you not go down there whoa well let's head back down

177
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
oh boy wow look at this look at this feel like this has something to do with it

178
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
oh does it yeah it does right I mean it black why wouldn't it

179
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
oh man I can remember so this is obviously the top row right

180
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
okay I'm gonna I'm gonna come back to this room but I do want to turn that light on

181
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
so you go in there now that it's on because there might be something else in here I didn't see

182
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:42,000
can I hear your dog rising up well I can hear it hold on it's very faint

183
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
just had to point out um you had a real horn dog

184
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
why did you have to find that out you would only know what it was if you were listening for it

185
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:16,000
yeah okay well obviously that's the same so let's go back in this room can I what does the light

186
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:26,000
have to be on all right please thank you again a loose bike of closure

187
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:36,000
so I should probably write some of these down all right let's make this let's make this circle

188
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
here what I don't with these symbols even up there

189
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
can I get a look at these let's see this guy can just tell me anything

190
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
okay in turn you shall find two rooms in the round

191
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:08,000
hmm in turn you shall find two rooms in the round interesting I'm gonna go look and see if those

192
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
symbols are up there if these symbols are up there then obviously that's the first second

193
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
thread bro

194
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Ant Lincoln does this again greetings friend I am Abraham Lincoln I could just take

195
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
pictures with my phone you're right why does he take so long to do the third one

196
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
okay where are those

197
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
not noticing any really

198
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
that's like astronauts and

199
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I bet I get maybe there's one picture in here that I can even make

200
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,000
can you reset that thing to default I wonder maybe it'll just go to default no

201
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I feel like there's just one picture in here that you can actually make

202
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
you know I mean like why would this line be here it's it's obviously telling me that

203
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
there's something has to be in these three lines right so what can be right moving them each

204
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,000
in the number of clicks that he did possibly but I mean there's got to be one picture I can make here

205
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
well that's that guy's face downstairs

206
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
yeah the yellow button is to say hey I did it

207
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
well it just for fun let's do it was two three one right yeah but that doesn't

208
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
doesn't that that doesn't determine up or down no

209
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:39,000
it's definitely a picture you have to make in this row but what is the picture

210
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'll check Instagram check Instagram

211
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
scales

212
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
there's anything else I can click on here no

213
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
who's that it's got to put the glasses on

214
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
it has to involve the jelly roll right that's the thing that's been

215
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
well

216
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
hold on I want to go back to the first room because remember I don't think I pushed

217
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I didn't push that thing all the way forward can I keep pushing this I think I can right yeah

218
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
should be able to no I guess not

219
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
not I guess not

220
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
what about this this is the only row that like is full

221
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:19,000
in turn you shall find two rooms in the round

222
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
now that just opens the door

223
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
yeah I'm gonna send the dog back in

224
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
well go and go in I think he actually used to be in the room

225
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
symbols of this show have to mean something

226
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:56,000
me

227
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,000
me

228
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
all right look that okay all right all right all right all right all right that jelly roll is

229
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
in that spot look at one two three jelly rolled absolutely goes in the left spot

230
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,000
but apps are positive a little why would they have these three squares so if that's the first one

231
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
what determines the second and third slot

232
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
is it the two things the two things I broke down but were those even pictures I don't remember

233
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
let's go find out

234
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
but yeah the jelly roll app is in the first spot

235
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
let's just let's go back to that room when do you get it gone

236
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
hmm I want to look at the symbols again that were on this thing

237
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I love it this is a heart it's like beating okay let's get the jelly roll here

238
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:27,000
there is all right this has to be in this spot I can't put this anywhere else it has to be here

239
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
now where is

240
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
anything else all right

241
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:50,000
is there a spike that kind of looks like it right not really though

242
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
oh

243
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:09,000
well can I maybe I can see oh geez Louise you can fucking go higher whatever happened here

244
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:18,000
it was not good all right well we figured it out we could go up a rub look at this guy

245
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
can you go any higher yes there's even more all right there's a whole lot going on here let's

246
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
holy shit that's gross can I talk to this guy yeah you're gonna want to write that down

247
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
term and there were a lot of people saying they salted it already even without knowing you could

248
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:45,000
go up this isn't really doing anything sure you this is going to walk over here

249
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
okay another piece to pick up I should probably take this

250
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
can't put anything in here

251
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I guess I can't walk over here yet can the dog go over there no I like did get another lever

252
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
this looks very important look at that mess I'm gonna have to figure that out eventually

253
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
this remind I believe is the important room

254
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
anything I can do in here well this is where the lever goes

255
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,000
okay

256
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:55,000
there's two rooms in the ground I guess I had to just keep going what about that can you do

257
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:06,000
anything with that dog yes you can nice work peak peak this is a cool room

258
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
oh

259
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
hopefully oh I've seen these symbols too

260
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
yep this square was on top of the octopus I don't I gotta turn the machine on though

261
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
right I think I do

262
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I

263
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
turns on a vacuum he has to go up there

264
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
do I have enough time to get there

265
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm not sure right that down maybe I should write that part down

266
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:02,000
so one thing I have noticed is yes these correspond to certain rooms right that down

267
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I don't need to write down yet I must get a remember

268
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
can the dog come in the dog can't come in here no right that dog

269
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
can I make it before this now I can't

270
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
anything else in here that I need to

271
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
is there a crystal floating up there

272
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
but we talked about the notebook this is why you have the notebook

273
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
now I'm gonna go back to the other room let's figure out the first thing first

274
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
because these things might not all be in the same order

275
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
is there still another room to go into

276
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
so see here I want to I want to just remember this because look up here

277
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
that rectangle right here

278
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
corresponds to the octopus these three prongs

279
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:11,000
was this game handmade yes it was this whole game is made out of clay and stuff and blocks and

280
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
word and all kinds of cool things

281
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
there's a button press the button

282
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
move the dog has to press it

283
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
can why don't you press the button please

284
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
touch it it's got a lightning bolt on it I need to write that down

285
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
lightning bolt over button

286
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:02,000
there a lightning bolt was also over the car the top right oh it was

287
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I don't need more that's down maybe that's how you power the that's probably how you power the car

288
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
so I guess you go

289
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
you know I'm gonna put the dog in here obviously another trippy freaky ass room

290
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
feel like we're getting closer to solving the first Abraham Lincoln puzzle

291
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
oh there it is there's the second symbol there's the second symbol

292
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'd call that I'd call that

293
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Pac-Man's cousin eating a lightning bolt

294
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,000
now theoretically the here's like the theoretical right we could go do that and then just

295
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
wild guess on the third one and get it eventually uh germa

296
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
that is actually baby carriage can struck by lightning I don't want to make sure you got that

297
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:22,000
that symbol right no it's Pac-Man's super cool sideburn brother

298
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
eating a lightning power up in the new Pac-Man's cousin game it's a different power up

299
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:40,000
oh okay I still haven't played that one yeah remember that though okay let's go back

300
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,000
this is armacrog it's currently oh I just clicked out of the window whoops

301
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:02,000
let's see if we can actually finish that puzzle

302
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
go back down

303
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Pac-Man Elvis impersonator that there there you go there it is

304
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
okay where is it

305
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
hmm this is not lined up correctly is it

306
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
there's that one can I get the jelly back here though

307
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
where's the jelly I gotta get it in the right spot

308
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
oh this is tough this is like a puzzle within a puzzle

309
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,000
no is there only one it must have to be like perfectly lined up

310
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
what the hell is the jelly

311
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:24,000
there it is oh oh okay I get it okay let's see if that's the one

312
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
yeah but I don't know what the last symbol is there's no way to tell

313
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
you just have to spam it see which the last one I gotta get it video no I didn't

314
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
always it just no it's just different every time I thought I had it all right well there's

315
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
no way to determine that because I might have to move these around too like this so we need to find

316
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:04,000
that last symbol it's only like 50 other possibilities

317
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:18,000
one thing that's been a common factor here is the dog is the one that sees them so

318
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
did I miss an area where he can go I don't think I did

319
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
go back in here

320
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I touch anything in this room

321
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000
don't think so

322
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I feel like I should be able to press this button

323
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
for some reason I can't I don't know

324
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I

325
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Oh, okay, that symbol is in this room.

326
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Star, pay attention, that symbol is in this room.

327
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Oh, thanks little buddy.

328
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
That lowered it.

329
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I still can't operate this though.

330
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Okay, right that down.

331
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Yeah, the right it down.

332
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's down.

333
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Let's go back.

334
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So for that to activate that has to be there so I can't do that puzzle until that room

335
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:19,000
is in the right spot.

336
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
That's different.

337
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Oh, wait, what the fuck is this thing?

338
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm like scared to go in this room.

339
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I feel like he's gonna eat me.

340
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Oh boy.

341
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:47,000
What was that?

342
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It's a it's baby.

343
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Can you imagine the wandering monsters this thing is attracting?

344
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I'm just saying.

345
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Tommy, Tommy, don't touch that thing.

346
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,000
You don't know where it's been.

347
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
P?

348
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Okay.

349
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
There you go.

350
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Tommy not has you now.

351
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I'll take care of you until you have to strike that baby with lightning figure out how to

352
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:42,000
get you back to where you belong.

353
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So I hold on.

354
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Did I just put the baby in my wife?

355
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Where did I just put that baby?

356
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Is another lever?

357
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:08,000
What a weird look at this thing.

358
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Something else has to be in this room.

359
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
This is a weird pattern for the cracks.

360
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Was that a symbol?

361
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I don't remember.

362
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Well, just remember, it's a square with the...

363
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
What can I do with that lever?

364
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Can't grab any of this stuff, can I?

365
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Cracks weird pattern, right that down.

366
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It never has to go somewhere.

367
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Let's find out where.

368
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I'm just going to remember that weird crack symbol looking thing.

369
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
At least crying.

370
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Wait, what?

371
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I'm like pulling up.

372
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh boy.

373
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Um.

374
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So I can't leave.

375
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Oh shit.

376
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Did I get it?

377
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Oh it's a song.

378
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It's not right.

379
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
That goes there, right?

380
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Okay, that's in the right spot.

381
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So yeah, these two just need to be flipped.

382
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
This is the one.

383
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Write that down.

384
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Write that song down.

385
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Didn't even need to write it down.

386
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I can't blow it.

387
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Oh, I can take the other ones off.

388
00:46:49,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Oh, I hope that doesn't mean I have to take off the punch of these.

389
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So the back ones are the ones that are correct.

390
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Yeah.

391
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I'm just going to rip them all off.

392
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
All right, so it goes.

393
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Nope, nope, I got it.

394
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
He threw up a.

395
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Well, that was interesting.

396
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So there's one of these crystals.

397
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Pick it up.

398
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Please.

399
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
There was another crystal in the other one back here.

400
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
But I got a lever, right?

401
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Let's find where that lever needs to go.

402
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I think it's up here.

403
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
No, go back up there.

404
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Tawami.

405
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I can probably now use this after I press the button.

406
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Thank good thing.

407
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Star was there to contribute and tell me what I needed to do.

408
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Pull it.

409
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
All right, just down.

410
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Pull the lever.

411
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
What the hell is he doing?

412
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Is he all right?

413
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Who's this freaking on?

414
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So I have to power it on.

415
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But I couldn't press that button before.

416
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Maybe it was.

417
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Can he just go?

418
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
No.

419
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Yeah, there's no power here.

420
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
The power needs to be turned on in this room.

421
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I am going to piss my pants, by the way.

422
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I can't.

423
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I got to get this first area done before I piss my pants.

424
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It's really important.

425
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
No, we're going to turn the room back to where it was.

426
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Now what is?

427
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
What is?

428
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:41,000
This means that there's power when I turn it to the right spot.

429
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
You know what I mean?

430
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I mean, I know I have to like, oh, turn the power on, but that light turned on.

431
00:49:51,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Because there's some connection that has to be made to this button.

432
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm just going to say that I'm going to try that.

433
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I'm going to turn this so the light turns on because then there's no need to be a power.

434
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,000
So in regards to the power, if I have something to do with the green Nickelodeon sludge in the pipes,

435
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
the room below that is the room you can't get into.

436
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Maybe.

437
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I want to try this first.

438
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
That's my vibe I'm getting.

439
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I just want to see, because that, like, the light is on now.

440
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I wonder if that does anything.

441
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Okay, Jerma.

442
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
What if you say boss?

443
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Okay.

444
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:57,000
The dial upstairs can be used.

445
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Just turning this.

446
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Oh, no.

447
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:15,000
All right.

448
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
So that turns.

449
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Remember where that is.

450
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So let's see what happens if I spin stuff.

451
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Wow, spin the wind.

452
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Because there are things all over this.

453
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
All right.

454
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Yeah.

455
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,000
So that's changing.

456
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Do it again.

457
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:53,000
This is a speed room.

458
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Well, that was kind of, that was buggy.

459
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Give one more time, maybe.

460
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I got a quiz.

461
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Have you been writing these things down, star?

462
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I have written everything down.

463
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
That has happened.

464
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I am the cartographer.

465
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Good.

466
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
What's the quiz?

467
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
The quiz is just to that.

468
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
There was no quiz.

469
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
It's going to be on my test.

470
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You know, it might just be, can I just not press the button?

471
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I feel like it's going to be lined up when that room is connected.

472
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I really do.

473
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I feel like when that room is connected to the one with the button,

474
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
and it'll be lined up, but I can't press the button.

475
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I hope that's not a bug.

476
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I hope that isn't a bug.

477
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Do you hear what I said, you moron?

478
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Too busy paying attention to the video game.

479
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Go look in the power room again.

480
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You're going to agree with me once you see it.

481
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
You're talking about the green slime.

482
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Yeah, and they glow in and go.

483
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Yeah.

484
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
You need to amp up that goo way before you can power it.

485
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Do you know how these things work?

486
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I don't know.

487
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I want to just get this in the right spot.

488
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I want to see.

489
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Never going to do it, dude.

490
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Shit!

491
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Can those even line up?

492
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I feel like it.

493
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
All right, let's see.

494
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It's probably going to be lined up.

495
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
With the thing, right?

496
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
No, it isn't.

497
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I don't even feel like.

498
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
You should be worried about this right now.

499
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
No, but I just wanted to make sure I wanted to get it in the right spot.

500
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
The power.

501
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So you're saying in this room, you're talking about in here, right?

502
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Like this green goo shit.

503
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Yeah, it's very low.

504
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
And the room below that, the way you'd imagine the green goo is coming from.

505
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
You can't get into it yet.

506
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So I'd leave this until you figure that out.

507
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Yeah.

508
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I just wish I could press the button.

509
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I just love pressing buttons.

510
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I know, I do.

511
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Every time I press button, I write it down.

512
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Yeah, the squiggles are aligned now.

513
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Right?

514
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
No.

515
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Dude, whatever, I'm going to buy the game and race you.

516
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Race me.

517
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Those other ones I didn't do on, I want to do this.

518
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It's a lot of trial and error to see if this works.

519
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I did skip one, although.

520
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
You're getting the error part down, right?

521
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
What is on it?

522
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Let's go look under there.

523
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Yeah, because I can't get in this room.

524
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I wish I could just accidentally get this.

525
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And let's wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait just a second.

526
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Maybe this is like a goo symbol, right?

527
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Maybe it's like a green goo symbol.

528
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
The error to most important symbol has been that lightning bolt.

529
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Is there a lightning bolt symbol?

530
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Let's find out. That's true.

531
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
The lightning bolt is on the baby carriage, so maybe not.

532
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Is there a baby? Maybe there's a baby.

533
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
This kind of looks like a baby.

534
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
No.

535
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Well, I think we could sit here and wild guess as much as we want.

536
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
But that's not going to work.

537
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
So I can't get in this room.

538
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I'm going to go back to the room.

539
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I'm going to go back to the room.

540
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I'm going to go back to the room.

541
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
So I can't get in this room.

542
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I have to get in this room to figure out the power.

543
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So maybe we go down.

544
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Can I touch this? Can I do anything here?

545
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Greetings, friend. I am Abraham Hantling.

546
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Let's take a look at the...

547
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
No.

548
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Nothing in the middle row, at least speaks to me.

549
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Try it, though.

550
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Why not?

551
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Got it.

552
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Got it.

553
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Oh, boy. This is not good.

554
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
What does that do?

555
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Oh, Jesus.

556
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Are you serious?

557
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I got to like freeze the room.

558
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I got to line this up.

559
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Let's go all the way to the left.

560
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
You can only go a certain amount of ways, right?

561
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
What does that mean?

562
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
That's what I'm doing.

563
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I'm not.

564
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Oh, okay. So one, two, two.

565
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I guess I have to make it hit it twice.

566
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
There needs to be two in the middle.

567
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Yeah, I think that's what you have to do.

568
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Oh, shit. No, it's doing...

569
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Okay, see what it's doing.

570
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
It's doing each part of you.

571
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Yeah, man. Oh, dude. Come on, man.

572
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I really do think of it this time.

573
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Let's see.

574
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So that's gotta go over here.

575
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It's like a... it's a safe.

576
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It's a lock.

577
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
So let's try this. Let's get this one here.

578
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
So that one is not frozen.

579
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Let's see.

580
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I'm assuming this is the answer, right?

581
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Let's try and do that again.

582
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Let me go to the right.

583
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I'm going to assume this is correct.

584
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:56,000
There it is.

585
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
All right, so this is the line.

586
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Power Shacken by should be able to press the button now.

587
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Should I pull this? No.

588
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I'm scared to pull that.

589
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I don't want to let you reset it.

590
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
So let's go back.

591
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
No, go back in this room.

592
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I wonder if we have a thing I can do if I can press the button.

593
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Yeah, one more.

594
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I'm going to go back in this room.

595
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I wonder if we have a thing I can do if I can press the button.

596
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
One more.

597
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
We all doubted him. He's a genius.

598
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Nothing, not really.

599
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Ah.

600
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Well, shit.

601
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

602
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,000
The chairman didn't solve it the way that I wanted.

603
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
This is connected now.

604
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
So now, okay, now this should be power to it.

605
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,000
If I get to the power side.

606
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:42,000
All right. I'm going to go up there first just to make sure.

607
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I don't want to spin the can press that button.

608
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I love this song, by the way.

609
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I want to listen to it for a second.

610
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Circuit is complete.

611
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Shit.

612
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:24,000
There's more the tubes.

613
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Now, the real question is, is this going to be lined up if the power turns on here?

614
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
So now, okay, we got power.

615
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I wonder if this is going to be out of alignment now.

616
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I don't want still an alignment.

617
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
But I don't think there's any power.

618
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
No, there's not. Gotta hit that button.

619
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I have to activate that button.

620
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I got to suck up the dog in that vacuum.

621
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I'm going to go back down here.

622
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I'm going to look in here one more time.

623
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:38,000
No, I don't want to change that.

624
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:46,000
What does he have to say, anything?

625
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Nothing!

626
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
All is in your hands now.

627
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:04,000
The threshold has been crossed.

628
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Who is this, by the way?

629
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Is that like Noah?

630
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I don't think there's anything I'm doing here.

631
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I'm going to go to the vacuum room.

632
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I'm definitely going to pee, though.

633
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I'll let you guys enjoy this while I go pee.

634
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I'll be back in two minutes.

635
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Quick bathroom break.

636
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I'm going to go over this in my head.

637
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Someone is making like what's your fart noise?

638
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I'll be right back.

639
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Here's my professional hold-on screen.

640
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I'll be right back.

641
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Start. Tell him a funny story.

642
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I don't want to be your funny story, guy.

643
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Here's a funny story.

644
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Once upon a time,

645
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Jerma played our Crog.

646
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:20,000
He was um...

647
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:27,000
One spawn time.

648
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Um...

649
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I've been writing down any jokes.

650
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I really haven't been paying that much attention.

651
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
It's really hard to follow what's been going on on screen.

652
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Because he's saying everything like 15 seconds ahead of me seeing it.

653
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Typical streamer boy stuff.

654
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Yeah, the stream was really dead without you.

655
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Where are you dude?

656
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I thought I heard a door.

657
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Maybe that was a door in real life.

658
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Yeah.

659
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Just dumb.

660
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Yeah.

661
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Just dumb.

662
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Just sitting here at the Elmo screen.

663
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Just sitting here at the Elmo screen.

664
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Here you go.

665
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I hope the story was good.

666
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I hope the story was good.

667
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I think people are still laughing about it.

668
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
It was awesome.

669
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It was awesome.

670
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Okay, let's go over a couple things in my brain here.

671
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I have the power turned on.

672
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Where was the power room?

673
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Which room actually had the power in it?

674
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Well, the crystal thing, not this one.

675
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Now the stream is boring again.

676
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Turn this back.

677
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
You know what you can do.

678
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,000
You can suck an egg.

679
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
What a weird insult that is.

680
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,000
That's pretty weird.

681
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Can this be activated now?

682
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Okay, so maybe if I put something up here.

683
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I feel like the dog has to be in here with me.

684
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Can I weigh that down?

685
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Maybe I can put the baby on the green thing?

686
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Maybe tube.

687
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Obviously the dog has to go up there.

688
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
But how do I get...

689
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I might have to actually put the baby on that.

690
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Because I can't do that.

691
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Because this doesn't really seem to do anything yet, at least.

692
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:18,000
You know that baby vomited it, I get threw up and gave it that green crystal.

693
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And then you suck it to vomit back in your stomach with it.

694
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
So...

695
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I can't go on here.

696
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Can't interact with that.

697
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Alright, let's go over a couple of things.

698
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I have a crystal.

699
01:09:49,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I need to turn the power on so I can use the roller coaster.

700
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:17,000
And then there's the vacuum there that he sucked the dog up and the dog ends up up here.

701
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I'm assuming, right?

702
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:27,000
He comes out of one of these tubes.

703
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Whatever.

704
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I can't really keep him there either.

705
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I'm gonna go back in there.

706
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:57,000
There's nothing else in there besides the dog.

707
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:04,000
He's going up.

708
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:26,000
He goes in here and he comes up the other side.

709
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Let's see if I can get him anywhere.

710
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Let's see if I can get him anywhere.

711
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I don't think he can go anywhere else.

712
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Alright.

713
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:09,000
He can't do this either.

714
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I'm gonna click every single inch of this.

715
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,000
That is right in his wheelhouse.

716
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
He's ready to press this button.

717
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Look at how ready he is to put his face in this button.

718
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:44,000
At least you should be able to press it, right?

719
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Even if it doesn't do anything.

720
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Maybe it's just an indicator.

721
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I'll tell you what he's doing.

722
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I'm gonna go down.

723
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I'm gonna look at the orange thing.

724
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:24,000
This can't be interacted with.

725
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:33,000
These don't mean anything yet.

726
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Oh, hold on.

727
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Hold on a second.

728
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Wait a second.

729
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I swear if we just turning the power off down here means the power on upstairs can be turned on.

730
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
That would be crazy if that's what this was.

731
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
That is a very never-hoot thing if that's what the problem is.

732
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Like, oh, you can't. You gotta use the power upstairs.

733
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I guess not.

734
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Should have wrote that down.

735
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Does the octopus talk?

736
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,000
No, he doesn't.

737
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I wonder if you can make him like stay.

738
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I'm trying to think about what hasn't been done.

739
01:14:48,000 --> 01:15:16,000
The only thing I can think of is trying to get into the crystal room, but that power is not like on.

740
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Maybe the power has to be on here.

741
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Then I can put the dog on here and then go in and do that.

742
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Try that. Maybe this works.

743
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
See what that does.

744
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Nice, weak, weak.

745
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
You don't mean like now is this turned on?

746
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:56,000
No, the dog come with me.

747
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Hmm.

748
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Can he go in here?

749
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Fucking stopped.

750
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I'm stopped.

751
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Let's take the dog back through here.

752
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Try to have the dog talk to the octopus and the weird-

753
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
You know, that's a good idea.

754
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:09,000
That's a very good idea. I'm gonna do that.

755
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Maybe he'll tell me something like, you need to turn the power on, press the button.

756
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:19,000
That's not the right room.

757
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I hope that works.

758
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Any thoughts?

759
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Oh, I don't know.

760
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Tell me on the loud diaper.

761
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I really forgot that people could even hear.

762
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I would just been spacing out.

763
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Yeah, you've been totally spaced out.

764
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Oh, fuck.

765
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
No, I wanted to click on the limit.

766
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Can I hold this?

767
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
No.

768
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Yes, I can.

769
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Hey, I'm gonna click on that again.

770
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
You hit the baby with lightning yet.

771
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
No.

772
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I have not.

773
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:58,000
You can't do that.

774
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Yeah, I mean, this is a game by the guys that made the neighborhood.

775
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000
So there are- it's very, very much you have to remember a lot of things.

776
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
And I'm in it for the long haul though.

777
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
It might take me a little while, but I'm in it for the long haul.

778
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I'll be back in three weeks.

779
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Yeah, see you in like six months.

780
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
You're just turning this lever like.

781
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
What do I do?

782
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Alright, please let me talk to the octopus as the dog in the secret world.

783
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
That's an MMO.

784
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
There we go.

785
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Hey you.

786
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Oh, it worked!

787
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I don't speak this language.

788
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I don't speak this language.

789
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Can't write this all down.

790
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I don't speak this language.

791
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Can't write this all down.

792
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Can't write this all down.

793
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I don't speak this language.

794
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I don't speak this language.

795
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I don't speak this language.

796
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I don't speak this language.

797
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I don't speak this language.

798
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I don't speak this language.

799
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:55,000
And I don't speak this language.

800
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:16,000
So these people were all killed.

801
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:42,000
All right, well, I got I thought I got a thing

802
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Did yeah did you get all that I

803
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I have a transcript if you want to go back. I'd like to hear the transcript. What is it

804
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Just in case I'm gonna see if

805
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Why do I feel like this game would be trivial and really easy if you spoke galactic space octopus?

806
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,000
was I picked up a thing right yeah what if that entire thing just told you every

807
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,000
single puzzle and sound it like it was telling you at least two or three of them I

808
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
think it probably was it probably was at least at the beginning it was like okay

809
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,000
use this one this one you go here and you're gonna need that

810
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:38,000
oh it puked I think my audio may have gotten screwed up yeah I have no

811
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:45,000
the games not making anymore like sounds wow quiet world dude let me save it

812
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,000
and restart it I think that's yeah you'll find a koopa okay hold on yeah I've

813
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:56,000
lost audio we ran into a bug there's a bug after that cutscene sometimes

814
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:03,000
maybe you lose all audio save the game

815
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
audio

816
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:23,000
now it sounds back now it's just not in some places yeah it killed the audio

817
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:31,000
random places that's what that fits now I can probably press the button yeah I

818
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:46,000
want to hold on a second hold on just one second I kind of can't because

819
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
you're coming through the same line as the game can't you lower skype's volume

820
01:22:50,000 --> 01:23:02,000
and windows I've done it that is what I have done a little more it's like shut up

01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:57,000
what is switch event away that like if you clap or laugh like you can hear the

828
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,000
laugh track you can hear everyone's laughs but if they say words it like you

so cool

835
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:31,000
it's like there's a little spot to go in hey look remember that thing that I already

836
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:45,000
got I already guessed it so that's a that I like was a step ahead

01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:59,000
this is where to go that way though how do I get up there well we're gonna go all the way around

838

844
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:13,000
let's speed through this can I go down maybe I wonder not gonna keep going to the right

845
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:19,000
new area

846
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:29,000
because of that's how you go in here so we're not gonna do that yet

847
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:43,000
well here we go

848
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:55,000
obviously have to put this down there okay this is gonna take me a minute

849
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I only have one going at a time

850
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:15,000
yeah only one can fit in at a time well you have to clear out the bottom

851
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
this one this one's gonna be this one's gonna be tough

852
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I gotta get them all over on one side I think for instance this is gotta go

853
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
all down here first maybe

854
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:46,000
shit

855
01:28:50,000 --> 01:29:04,000
all three of those can go up here now right always the bottom bottoms over there

856
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:09,000
let's get the bottom out

857
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:26,000
get the bottom out first we're not going to be talking about

858
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
having some trouble

859
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:38,000
dude you're having trouble hey you're the one having the trouble

860
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:50,000
shit I think I actually can move this one here

861
01:29:50,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I did kind of screw myself with that actually not really now I can just do that

862
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I bet if you use the baby you could just skip this maybe maybe maybe

863
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:17,000
complete now you haven't some trouble star me I did it what would I be having trouble

864
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I don't know is your trouble some for another one of these octopus people

865
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
did a dog food bowl is a dog bowl eat out of that dog bowl I command you

866
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
up here looks that looks like a haunted house

867
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:57,000
grass coming on over here I'm assuming something's gonna come out of there in

868
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,000
land and he's gonna eat it just I just want to take a look at the rooms

869
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:23,000
hmm interesting doesn't seem to be doing anything at the moment you have to turn it on

870
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:32,000
can you grab that dude what are you doing

871
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:48,000
you don't want to pull the lever there a reason why you don't want to do that

872
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:57,000
okay okay let's see what's in this room

873
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
yeah looks kind of familiar here here's this guy again

874
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,000
inspire others to great heights and your objectives shall be reached

875
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:25,000
you didn't say it again totally shit

876
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:38,000
you want to read a whole book oh man this is a long

877
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:44,000
this this is lore this is a lot of lore

878
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
what if I had to read this whole thing to figure out a certain puzzle I probably will

879
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:01,000
no one these guys I probably will have to read this like whole thing well we'll find out if I

880
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:06,000
need to or not write it down I'm gonna write that down write down that entire script

881
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:23,000
well let's just have him stand on that and see what happens maybe I can just stand on it

882
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:36,000
turns the lights off I'm just gonna keep him there maybe he can stay there

883
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,000
all right

884
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I pull the lever now

885
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Jesus

886
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I'm not even sure what to start here

887
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
so

888
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:17,000
there's some color coding that needs to be thought of here

889
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
let's go from room to room to see

890
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:37,000
well these are symbols I don't know if these mean anything but they probably do

891
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
and they're wearing things too

892
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:55,000
each astronaut has to be the right let's pull this again just we'll see what happens

893
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I kind of scrambled it a little bit

894
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I'm gonna go outside here because I haven't been out here since the it's been dark

895
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
I guess it doesn't really affect out here that much

896
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I'm gonna turn the lights back on because they had badges

897
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
okay

898
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
turn the lights back on

899
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:52,000
okay big peak green guess what guys hey guess what write it down green

900
01:35:52,000 --> 01:36:01,000
red purple blue yellow or orangeish

901
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:12,000
line those up somehow by using your skills of deduction

902
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
still don't know what this does

903
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
star are you going to contribute or what

904
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,000
I don't think he's even here I don't think he's here

905
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
let's just see what happens here

906
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I

907
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
hmm wait a second

908
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,000
is it is it combining the colors I think it's combining them to make these colors let's see

909
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,000
this is correct

910
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
oh

911
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
you leaving

912
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I'm watching if I see something and you're too stupid I'm gonna go tell

913
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:20,000
green okay got that one look hey you haven't you haven't like even

914
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
all you told me to do was like strike the baby with lightning

915
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,000
was that oh good that was that was good that was great advice

916
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,000
these are color coded and then some way you're going to have to line them up

917
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
uh what do you think I'm doing what do you want me to tell you

918
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:43,000
I don't know you I'm I did it I already did it didn't even need stars help star you know what you know what you

919
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,000
still get out of here you know what get out of here listen get out can I have you listen

920
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:58,000
if it's like I have a story on the top of one all right go so I didn't think you were gonna get by

921
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:06,000
waiting for a story no I didn't think you're gonna let me I just I'm waiting for a story

922
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
if you want a story read the one on the wall

923
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
oh

924
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:24,000
oh do it everyone wants to hear it no no no it's a lot it's a long long that's a lot

925
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:32,000
you're like I'm not gonna want to talk again after you do it another one of these guys

926
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
hold on we get a great song hold on

927
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I need to listen to this

928
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
it's got an accordion

929
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:01,000
this music is so great terry scott Taylor you are genius

930
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:14,000
I'm gonna push this in the other room can I look out here

931
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I can't look out the window I want to get down I want to get down

932
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
all right maybe I can't push him I'd like to go down here

933
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
no I guess not whatever

934
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:41,000
yeah yeah here's the yeah I can't even push him I really want yeah somebody saying I want one

935
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:47,000
of these maybe cool just to have one of these is like a toy just so I got like something

936
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:55,000
put on your desk the paperweight that'd be cool so what did that I got a lever is there a lever

937
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
in the first room

938
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:11,000
that allowed me to get the lever to put into something here maybe

939
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:20,000
oh no I just want to make sure there's nothing out here that I missed

940
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,000
nope besides the weird birds

941
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:35,000
um I actually am going to write this down see this octopus this purple octopus has this

942
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
symbol so we're gonna say p-octo

943
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:46,000
uh I'm gonna draw that p-octo this first symbol

944
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:56,000
and the other one was like orange right it was an orange octo it orange lips and he had the

945
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
rectangle oh octo had the rectangle

946
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
okay let's uh go down

947
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:18,000
I just make sure I can't go any further I can there is another area

948
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,000
another power symbol let's start at the bottom and there's a lever

949
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
what the lever doesn't go here

950
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
are you kidding me?

951
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
are you kidding me the lever doesn't go there

952
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
well this is I can't do anything in here I know so we're gonna go back up I need another lever

953
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
write that down

954
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
you're progressing too far yeah I there were things I didn't do in the other room but that's you

955
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
got backtracking man you gotta go backwards at some point

956
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:14,000
this is so cool this is bird shit that's so uh this is definitely I love stuff like this man

957
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:23,000
like they this is probably real bird shit right that's a place for a lever

958
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:50,000
okay that was cool that was really cool it just stretched out the the accordion room

959
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:00,000
hey I remember this we wrote it down and what was it two

960
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:19,000
oh fuck already what go on two three one but oh it's got to be the right color too

961
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
it's got to be the right colors okay

962
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I actually don't know I this this has been just shown up a couple times I think

963
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
well we can't do this one yet I need to know what the colors are could I do anything with these birds

964
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:54,000
hey let me save it I want to make sure I save the game often there is an auto save but you know

965
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
just in case you never know I could run into like a crash

966
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:07,000
the colors actually I'm gonna write the symbols down to

967
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:15,000
because that would make sense right the color my notebook is all screwed up I got

968
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:24,000
scribbles everywhere this is not right this is just not right it all this is just incorrect

969
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:30,000
oh it's really simple with the crown

970
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
then we got giant mustache

971
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:51,000
and then we got the shoe that looks like a shoe kind of like a Yoshi foot

972
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
okay let's go back

973
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:08,000
I'll everything in here might have changed as well it did look at the color

974
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:19,000
dude here's another power machine what color is it

975
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
I'm assuming I have to get it from the octopus person yeah check out

976
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
that's a blue that's blue that's a blue button ain't it

977
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
a lot of rooms here

978
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:48,000
a lot of rooms here

979
01:45:53,000 --> 01:46:01,000
hey good day I am Thomas Jefferson I have to sign the declaration of independence

980
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I needed me my quill who has my quill there they are

981
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:14,000
oh it's like doing the subtitles no okay it was purple green purple green yellow

982
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:26,000
purple green yellow got the colors we got the colors boys and girls

983
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Thomas Jefferson now what the hell does that do hey remember what the colors were

984
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I'm assuming that turns on this vacuum that can't be turned on because there's no power

985
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
stretching yeah I was

986
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
yeah what the hell you're just like saying you're repeating yourself very slowly

987
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:23,000
how shit now purple you messed it up and that's all I've been talking about

988
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
well I'm trying to concentrate and there's a guy just like going

989
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,000
do I vote him what do you guys think should I do I vote him

990
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,000
what should what before I like I already clicked it but I mean do you want to get voted or what

991
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I don't deserve that kind of truth there's the quill

992
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
let's go back to Thomas Jefferson give Thomas Jefferson the quill

993
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,000
I'm I'm seeing I'm seeing a lot of yeses I'm seeing a lot of yes boedham

994
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
ss

995
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:10,000
what does he do with the quill is he gonna write me a parchment

996
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,000
you say the colors one more time like that and you're gone you're out of here

997
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,000
huh what does that mean

998
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
I get okay I get a hot I don't I guess we're gonna murder time

999
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I don't know what it means but it's like a constellation kind of

1000
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:06,000
you talk to the ant president so you could get it yeah there's gonna be there's definitely

1001
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,000
gonna be like a George washing tent or something like George Washington and is that it all

1002
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:16,000
there is here actually not I want to yeah I want to see what were the colors on that

1003
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:22,000
can you yeah I wish I could vote you but I can't

1004
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I think it's the colors don't matter here in congress today

1005
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:32,000
okay

1006
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:46,000
yes this is made the creator of earthworm gym did make all these characters in these like the creator

1007
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,000
co-creator I guess there's another bunch of people that worked on it

1008
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
now what did that what does that do for me

1009
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
there's a bunch of rooms I still haven't gone in so

1010
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:10,000
wasn't there something oh shit that's a symbol write it down what color is it

1011
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:17,000
well then I uh something I this up is a speaking of ants there's there's a there's an ant

1012
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:23,000

1013
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:28,000
oh my god if you'd end up needing to know what color that symbol was you're gonna you're

1014
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,000
gonna really gonna regret this wait what it's just like a Soviet

1015

you

1018
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,000
you really wanted to get that last word too

1019
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
it's just like a ship

1020
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
yeah poor poor drunk star

1021
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000

01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
yeah get why don't you get shocked shocked

1023
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
you climb back up

1024
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:35,000
oh damn can we go par how does he get up there

1025
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:46,000
oh I mean to be to be fair right to be fair he was just typing very loudly and then would

1026
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:52,000
you say the colors maybe what am I supposed what am I supposed to it's like you get booted

1027
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
that is that that okay so that's where the dog comes out you talk to the person

1028
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
but is there a dog hole I didn't go into

1029
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:19,000
and go back up here hey he was bringing his writing things down he was writing things down

1030
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
no dog hole here that doesn't bring it back up

1031
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:47,000
here can you go in the sewer

1032
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
yeah we need a dog hole

1033
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:01,000
maybe did I miss one that was done here

1034
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,000
there was a button to press I'm gonna get that from that lady I'm gonna get

1035
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:18,000
shit where is there another dog hole maybe

1036
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Sean what's going on dude

1037
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:41,000
did anybody see a dog hole there was the exit from the dog hole maybe can I I can't

1038
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:46,000
climb it and put him through and there's no power there won't be power until I talk to the

1039
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:52,000
octopus person oh whoa whoa hold on just a second here

1040
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:02,000
oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no I gotta make that

1041
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:15,000
symbol the symbol is from here I need to determine what where these guys are moving because I

1042
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:24,000
wrote that symbol down that's the first one right no it goes down to the right

1043
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
so

1044
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
no that's not it

1045
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:44,000
hmm I had him in the right spot

1046
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
well what determines where they move is that's just the empty spot

1047
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:02,000
because it goes right left right up so it would go bang bang bang bang right

1048
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
oh this can move too shit

1049
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
maybe it's the laser has to come out

1050
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:30,000
okay just to go right

1051
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:36,000
that no

1052
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:51,000
I'm trying to determine is the white line the one that's active or the the black line

1053
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:00,000
that's got almost there this is to go down this way like if this if this right now was going

1054
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
like that instead

1055
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:12,000
hmm

1056
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
you know what I mean like this way this way that way that way

1057
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
what determines if they connect

1058
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:38,000
so maybe his mouth

1059
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,000
yeah every time it's from his mouth

1060
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
okay

1061
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
huh

1062
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,000
that's that's like it but it's not the right way it's like upside down

1063
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
I'm assuming I have to shoot the laser into the mouth

1064
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:21,000
I just don't know like how to get it the way I want it

1065
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:29,000
and am I trying to make it shoot into his like mouth or have him go backwards

1066
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
hold on

1067
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
you this to that

1068
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
feel like there's some connection there

1069
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
and I can't move this one now

1070
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:04,000
I

1071
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:14,000
feel like I have to get this one up there and then he has to be over here

1072
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:23,000
so once he's here that's the end this is the end right here

1073
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,000
so then I need to go down this way

1074
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:35,000
not smooth him over here oh that's so close but it's not right

1075
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,000
that's so close one two three four that's so close but it's not right

1076
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
oh

1077
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,000
nope hold on

1078
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:57,000
no

1079
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
nope this needs to be that way

1080
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
can't enjoy the dark lines

1081
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
the

1082
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
the cannon's definitely in the right spot

1083
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
I had it close before

1084
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I got to move him back out of the way

1085
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
so it has to go to here to

1086
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
laser should be in the right spot right

1087
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
because wouldn't it come down like this

1088
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,000
put the laser here because then it would be

1089
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
oh

1090
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
oh

1091
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,000
this is close

1092
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
shit

1093
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
this is really close I'm just trying to think about it before I move anything

1094
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
These have to be swapped right over.

1095
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,000
See what that is?

1096
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Not put him back.

1097
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:26,000
One, two, three, four.

1098
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,000
This is always going to come out like this.

1099
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
See where it pops out from.

1100
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Bottom here.

1101
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:48,000
This is always going to come out like this.

1102
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
See where it pops out from.

1103
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Bottom here.

1104
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:02,000
No.

1105
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:07,000
It's the way that it connects.

1106
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:13,000
See where it pops out from.

1107
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Okay, hold on.

1108
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Okay, hold on.

1109
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Yeah, this kind of like has to go here, right?

1110
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,000
That has to go there.

1111
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Because now I need it to come down and over.

1112
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Hold on.

1113
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Hold on.

1114
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Hold on.

1115
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Hold on.

1116
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Oh, it's so close.

1117
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:11,000
It's close.

1118
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Okay.

1119
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I'm looking at the symbol from this perspective.

1120
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Move this one over here for a second.

1121
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Okay, no, these can be moved over here, but that doesn't help me at all.

1122
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:52,000
I'm going to put him back.

1123
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Everyone go back.

1124
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,000
It needs to be a line here.

1125
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
You need to switch.

1126
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:10,000
How do I get this guy to get down here?

1127
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:18,000
You go down here and it's over.

1128
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I wonder if he can't be connected to something.

1129
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:29,000
He's down there now.

1130
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Hold on.

1131
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:46,000
No, no, no, no.

1132
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Come back here.

1133
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Oh, it's just the connections that just confuse the hell out of me.

1134
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:16,000
There.

1135
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Oh, shit.

1136
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Okay, I need to go.

1137
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:45,000
He needs to go down here.

1138
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Oh, shit.

1139
02:05:52,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Oops, I didn't mean to do that.

1140
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Just for fun, I'm going to move the cannon around a little more.

1141
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I need to see it from every angle.

1142
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Hold on.

1143
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Hold on a second.

1144
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:38,000
He's almost down there.

1145
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Hold on.

1146
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Hold on.

1147
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Hold on.

1148
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Hold on.

1149
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Hold on.

1150
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Hold on.

1151
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Hold on.

1152
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:41,000
There needs to be a connection here, but there's only two lines.

1153
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
You know what I mean?

1154
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Like I'm trying to, because it has to be like this.

1155
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
One, two, three, four.

1156
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

1157
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,000
There's five pieces.

1158
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:12,000
They only connect a certain way like this, like with diagonals.

1159
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Now I had it the right way before.

1160
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1161
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Hold on.

1162
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Hold on.

1163
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:27,000
This is so close.

1164
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Hold on.

1165
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:39,000
It's upside down in that way.

1166
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:48,000
This one's just like, I just keep getting confused.

1167
02:09:48,000 --> 02:10:03,000
But I can't bring this guy back down.

1168
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:07,000
You go that way, you go this way, fuck.

1169
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Maybe I should pull a baby out.

1170
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:22,000
I was so close before.

1171
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Don't, just like that way.

1172
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Hold on a second.

1173
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:47,000
This needs to make it a V.

1174
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:56,000
This needs to be like that down here.

1175
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Because the way I'm looking at it in the symbol, right?

1176
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:03,000
This has to be like that.

1177
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:08,000
How do I get that down there?

1178
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1179
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Done.

1180
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:26,000
No, I'm getting it.

1181
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:32,000
I got it. Hold on.

1182
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Oh yeah. Come on now.

1183
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:40,000
No, not quite.

1184
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1185
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I got it. This is correct now.

1186
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:51,000
I need, oh, shit.

1187
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:58,000
This has got to be in the middle.

1188
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:05,000
This guy, this has got to go like that.

1189
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:09,000
And this has got to go like this.

1190
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,000
So he has to be here.

1191
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,000
I got it.

1192
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:18,000
I just got to move it around.

1193
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:23,000
He has to be down here.

1194
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Right, because then that connects that.

1195
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:38,000
These two need to be swapped.

1196
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:47,000
That's correct.

1197
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:54,000
That just needs to make that V down here.

1198
02:12:54,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Okay.

1199
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:22,000
That's it.

1200
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:25,000
That's it.

1201
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:29,000
I did it.

1202
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I did it, mom.

1203
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I did it.

1204
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Hey.

1205
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Okay.

1206
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Okay.

1207
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,000
So here's how I got crossed up there.

1208
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,000
I'm a fool.

1209
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:59,000
I didn't look at what I wrote down.

1210
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Because we'll look at it first.

1211
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:05,000
I wasn't thinking kind of outside the box.

1212
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:10,000
All I had to do was just make a V on the left and a V on the bottom.

1213
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Okay.

1214
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:24,000
See what's in the next room.

1215
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Same thing except it's a way to blog.

1216
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Let's just go all the way through and take a look at everything.

1217
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:45,000
What the hell is wrong with this guy?

1218
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Can I get up there?

1219
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:52,000
I guess I can't climb up that.

1220
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I know what I can do though.

1221
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,000
I can push.

1222
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Where did Beek Beek go?

1223
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Where's the dog?

1224
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Where the hell is the dog?

1225
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:27,000
I don't know where he is.

1226
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Let me go.

1227
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Let me go.

1228
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Where's the dog?

1229
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
He's just sitting on the button.

1230
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Get over here.

1231
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:57,000
I forgot I had you sitting on that button.

1232
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Yeah. Beek Beek.

1233
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:06,000
I've got a new button for you to step on.

1234
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Yeah, step on this one.

1235
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:12,000
You're my button pressing dog.

1236
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Thanks, little buddy.

1237
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Did I screw myself here?

1238
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,000
All right.

1239
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Kind of scared that I might have just accidentally screwed that whole thing up.

1240
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:36,000
I can push this now.

1241
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Don't go all the way back.

1242
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Him stepping on that drops the block.

1243
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:54,000
I'm going to jump on this and then jump on him and then jump on his head.

1244
02:16:54,000 --> 02:17:02,000
You know you get to do.

1245
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Look at his face.

1246
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:08,000
He's like, yes.

1247
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:11,000
I'm helping.

1248
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:14,000
He reminds me of little Otto.

1249
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Go on and keep pushing.

1250
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:25,000
So now get off.

1251
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Should loosen this one, right?

1252
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:37,000
No.

1253
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Okay. Can I reset this one?

1254
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Okay. Hold on.

1255
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:10,000
You go ahead and stand on that, buddy.

1256
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:25,000
There we go.

1257
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Let's see what's up here.

1258
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:41,000
I don't know how they just stretched this out.

1259
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:45,000
That's a little bug.

1260
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
That's it.

1261
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,000
A fly.

1262
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Save it.

1263
02:18:54,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Can that fly be put somewhere?

1264
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,000
I think so.

1265
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Kind of have to.

1266
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Where was there a spot for a fly?

1267
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:23,000
It was a by-question.

1268
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:30,000
I can suck up something here too.

1269
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Can we fit in here?

1270
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:43,000
No.

1271
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Can I put him in the dog bowl?

1272
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Oh no. The baby's crying again.

1273
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Don't know.

1274
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Okay.

1275
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Boy.

1276
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Go on the right way.

1277
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:19,000
That one's all screwed up.

1278
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:29,000
I'm pretty sure this is right.

1279
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:33,000
I got off to push.

1280
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Well, let me listen.

1281
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Do do.

1282
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Now.

1283
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I think that's right.

1284
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Nope.

1285
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Nope.

1286
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:11,000
This goes here.

1287
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
So it's there and there.

1288
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Right?

1289
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,000
No.

1290
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Here and here.

1291
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Did I swap this the wrong way?

1292
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Yeah, I wish there was like a speed up button.

1293
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:53,000
I hope I didn't do this wrong.

1294
02:21:53,000 --> 02:22:04,000
I don't think I did though.

1295
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1296
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Where's it going?

1297
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Okay. Done.

1298
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:16,000
See the worst part about this particular puzzle is this is obviously is a staple of this game.

1299
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:27,000
So when I have to do the entire thing, it's going to be really annoying.

1300
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:30,000
And he dropped another crystal.

1301
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:34,000
That's the third crystal, by the way.

1302
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:38,000
That is crystal number three.

1303
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Put the fly in here, maybe.

1304
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Yep.

1305
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:51,000
What does that do?

1306
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
He just like died.

1307
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Does he eat that?

1308
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Big, big eats it now.

1309
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:03,000
It is a dog ball, right?

1310
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Doesn't big, big fly when he eats a fly?

1311
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Didn't that happen?

1312
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Well, he ate it.

1313
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:19,000
So I can't get it back.

1314
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Now do I fly out here?

1315
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Would it be?

1316
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Maybe I take him up to that.

1317
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Yeah, I might take him up to the area where I found the fly.

1318
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I got a pee again.

1319
02:23:45,000 --> 02:24:06,000
I'm drinking a bunch of coffee and I'm like piss boy right now.

1320
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:09,000
I'm going to see if you can fly over here.

1321
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:13,000
I know the probably can take him to where that thing was above the octopus.

1322
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,000
But I just want to know, no, he can't even come down.

1323
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:26,000
He can't even walk up it.

1324
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,000
So yeah, he'll fly up the vine.

1325
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:36,000
I'm seeing it.

1326
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:45,000
I love these rooms.

1327
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
These are all so interesting.

1328
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
So interesting.

1329
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Let me guess.

1330
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
You're going to get wings?

1331
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:56,000
You're going to fly up here?

1332
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Come on.

1333
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Beak, beak.

1334
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,000
What's going on here?

1335
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Beak, beak.

1336
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Be real nice if you could fly up there, buddy.

1337
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Be really, really great if you could get up there, man.

1338
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:49,000
How do I get him to fly?

1339
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Is there something I'm missing here?

1340
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Is he not ready to fly yet?

1341
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,000
I don't think I can flatten the room.

1342
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
There's nothing in here.

1343
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:15,000
This is where the spinning wheel was, right?

1344
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Over here.

1345
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:32,000
I wish I had a bit of a hit.

1346
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
I wish I had a hit because he ate it.

1347
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:35,000
I can't get it back.

1348
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:40,000
If he has something to give me, he'll spit it out in front of me.

1349
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Well, let's go.

1350
02:26:45,000 --> 02:27:08,000
I can't go anywhere here.

1351
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:14,000
There was like a place in the...here we are.

1352
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Backtrack to the first room.

1353
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Oh, God.

1354
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:22,000
That might be a thing.

1355
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Wasn't there something in this room that I missed?

1356
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:38,000
I feel like there was something else that I didn't do over here.

1357
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Can you fly up there?

1358
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Can you go up there, beak, beak.

1359
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:52,000
No.

1360
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Huh.

1361
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Huh.

1362
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:11,000
So, this seems to be a little bit of a problem.

1363
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:27,000
There are no more flies to feed him.

1364
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:31,000
There's a button right here, though.

1365
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:34,000
I feel like I need to move this out of the way.

1366
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:38,000
But I can't.

1367
02:28:38,000 --> 02:29:03,000
There's a big red button here, but I can't move this guy.

1368
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Backtrack.

1369
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Backtrack time.

1370
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:25,000
What?

1371
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:28,000
He already ate this.

1372
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Oh, my God.

1373
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
What?

1374
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,000
What?

1375
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
What the hell?

1376
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
What?

1377
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:49,000
You have to do it in the same room.

1378
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Okay, well, let's talk.

1379
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Let's see another cutscene with a bunch of gibberish.

1380
02:29:54,000 --> 02:30:14,000
I already did that, though.

1381
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:17,000
I'm sorry.

1382
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:20,000
I'm sorry.

1383
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:24,000
I'm sorry.

1384
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:28,000
I'm sorry.

1385
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:32,000
I'm sorry.

1386
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:41,000
I'm sorry.

1387
02:30:41,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Okay.

1388
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Eat it.

1389
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Eat it.

1390
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Eat the...

1391
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Thank you.

1392
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:28,000
What's going here?

1393
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:33,000
This is going to take me, I'm not entirely sure.

1394
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:40,000
He sure can fit a lot of things in his stomach.

1395
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:50,000
He just said my name.

1396
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
I just said my name.

1397
02:31:52,000 --> 02:32:01,000
I just said my fucking name.

1398
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:11,000
I just said my name.

1399
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:15,000
I just said my name.

1400
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:19,000
I just said my name.

1401
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:23,000
I think this is showing some of the backers.

1402
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:28,000
I better write that down.

1403
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:35,000
I got to see my name.

1404
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:43,000
This is probably one of the Kickstarter, like credit roll things.

1405
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:46,000
That was very surprising.

1406
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:52,000
I did not expect to go into this room and then see my name on the screen.

1407
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:55,000
This is not the end of the game by any means.

1408
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Let's think about this.

1409
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Is there anything I can actually do in this room?

1410
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Or is this like a bonus Kickstarter room?

1411
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
There it was again.

1412
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:10,000
I guess let's...

1413
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Well, we found that.

1414
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:29,000
I have a few things to give my friend down here.

1415
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Oh shit.

1416
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:37,000
I already see the feeling of sneak.

1417
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:41,000
It's in Sanatroft.

1418
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:45,000
They don't know what it is.

1419
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:52,000
I can't hear anything.

1420
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:59,000
I can't hear anything.

1421
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Oh my god, I can skip it.

1422
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Hey, give me that stuff you just got.

1423
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:21,000
I can't even tell what that was.

1424
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:28,000
That's the lever for downstairs.

1425
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:31,000
And then that's also the thing to turn the power on.

1426
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:37,000
I don't know what I should do first, but I do know what I should do first.

1427
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
It's pee.

1428
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:42,000
I've been drinking coffee.

1429
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:45,000
It makes me just hold on a sec.

1430
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:46,000
I've been right back.

1431
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:12,000
You

1432
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:42,000
You

1433
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,000
You

1434
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:41,000
You

1435
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Can get out of here.

1436
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Right it down.

1437
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Yeah This could be a clue.

1438
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:04,000
I just peed and forgot the entire game.

1439
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:07,000
What was happening?

1440
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Let's go down, let's go down first.

1441
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Go down.

1442
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:25,000
This is not the lever for right here.

1443
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Dead. All right. Call me stupid. I really thought that was going to be it.

1444
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Okay. Well, let's go put the bug in the machine.

1445
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
And...Dunk.

1446
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:58,000
No, whoops.

1447
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Who was the power button? The other room over here.

1448
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:10,000
There it is. Except it's currently functioning.

1449
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Now it is.

1450
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Okay, well, let me go out back again.

1451
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:26,000
This should be functioning.

1452
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
It is functioning.

1453
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:36,000
So now does that allow me to use the...

1454
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
...shick downstairs?

1455
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
I can press this button, no.

1456
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Does that open the door? I hope so.

1457
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Please open the door.

1458
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Oh, I pressed the button. I can press it.

1459
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Big, big.

1460
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:10,000
It's time for you to take another trip.

1461
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Why?

1462
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
I'm going to press the button.

1463
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:33,000
A couple different ways to go here. I just saw that up here.

1464
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Let's go here first.

1465
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:40,000
This is going to be confusing.

1466
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
Oh, boy.

1467
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Oh, shit. I accidentally clicked out of the window.

1468
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
How did I do that?

1469
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:54,000
I wish me luck as I have no idea what the hell I'm going on.

1470
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
I found a button.

1471
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:16,000
That sounds like suction.

1472
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Okay.

1473
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:26,000
So there's one of two things that are going to happen here.

1474
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:33,000
I suck up the cheese guy from the pipe that's in that room.

1475
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:41,000
I can push that block back and it sucks up and it's probably going to go back to that other room.

1476
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:46,000
Let's go down here.

1477
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:53,000
It's not a lever.

1478
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Come on, go down there.

1479
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
I think that's...

1480
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.

1481
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:13,000
That's all I could do up there, right?

1482
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Let's go left just to make sure I didn't miss anything.

1483
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
No, I didn't.

1484
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Because this takes you all the way around, right?

1485
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Just to be clear, I'm just going to look up here and make sure, yes, okay, let's leave.

1486
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:37,000
He's flapping so hard that's...

1487
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:40,000
If he stopped doing what he was doing, he was going to hit the ground like brick.

1488
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
That's a lot of fun.

1489
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:46,000
I'm going to remove the cheese Cheetos block.

1490
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Now I can open the other door.

1491
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Let's just see what's in that other room first before I do anything else.

1492
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Thank you.

1493
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Very much.

1494
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:06,000
It has to go right here, right?

1495
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:11,000
Let's go.

1496
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Well, there's the other lever.

1497
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:19,000
No, fuck.

1498
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Didn't want to do that.

1499
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Well, I did it, so let's just see what's over here.

1500
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:32,000
I can't go that way.

1501
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Whoa.

1502
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
We can keep going.

1503
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Look at this. Look at how crazy this is.

1504
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:59,000
What is that? 5%? 5 over 50?

1505
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Write it down.

1506
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:05,000
5%?

1507
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Is that a 5% 50 or is that 5?

1508
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:12,000
What the hell is that symbol?

1509
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:16,000
50, 50?

1510
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Whatever.

1511
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:30,000
The zero, that zero is really small.

1512
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Damn.

1513
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:57,000
I'm just going to take a minute.

1514
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Let's see how much that moves, and then I can determine how many more times I have to do it.

1515
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Let's move one more, but I still can't go over there.

1516
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Maybe this one moves that.

1517
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:29,000
I'm going to assume doing that is going to move this, so let's go and move the second one once more.

1518
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:35,000
Yeah.

1519
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Thanks.

1520
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Yeah.

1521
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Thanks.

1522
02:44:55,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Wait a second.

1523
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Was that not moving that other one?

1524
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:09,000
This one here.

1525
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:15,000
That should be moving.

1526
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:21,000
It's moving the green one.

1527
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:28,000
One more.

1528
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:31,000
One more or two more.

1529
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Then I have to bring this one all the way around again, so that's one, two, so one over here and then two over there.

1530
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:46,000
One, then one, two.

1531
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Do I reach out at all?

1532
02:45:53,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Of course I do, but I am trying to focus on the game because this requires a fuck I did it too many times.

1533
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:12,000
The game like this, I have to remember a lot of things and focus on a puzzle that's hard to.

1534
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:15,000
I need to focus.

1535
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:19,000
I only do it once per screen or something.

1536
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:25,000
No, let's go.

1537
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Hello, screen.

1538
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:42,000
I've seen a million times.

1539
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:47,000
A lot of things remember I'm going back to the original area.

1540
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Is it like a dancing?

1541
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:02,000
What are these guys doing?

1542
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:08,000
There's something here I need to remember.

1543
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
You know what I mean?

1544
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Is it in the order they do this?

1545
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:15,000
Are the colors?

1546
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:22,000
No idea.

1547
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:39,000
Well, it's three pinks and two grades.

1548
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:46,000
Maybe when you looked out the window, yeah, they were.

1549
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:49,000
Well, I'm just going to...

1550
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Pink, gray, pink, pink, gray.

1551
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
Just, I don't know, I feel like they're going to need to...

1552
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:02,000
It's probably the order they're chirping to.

1553
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:07,000
One pink, gray, gray.

1554
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:16,000
Oh, okay.

1555
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Oh, five, no idea.

1556
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:25,000
If we need to come back, we come back.

1557
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:26,000
You're out here, but thanks a lot.

1558
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Thanks for coming.

1559
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Take it easy, dude.

1560
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:35,000
A whole nother room.

1561
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:40,000
A whole nother area.

1562
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
This one has a gigantic scratch on it.

1563
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Looks like someone tried to break in.

1564
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
Another one of these.

1565
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Oh, shit.

1566
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:56,000
This is not fair.

1567
02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:01,000
That's not fair at all.

1568
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Which one goes on the bottom?

1569
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:08,000
I need to look at the bottom first.

1570
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:11,000
So it's a swirl.

1571
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:12,000
This one, right?

1572
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:17,000
It's the only one that exists.

1573
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Holy shit.

1574
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:29,000
This is going to be difficult because I need to know exactly which one.

1575
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:30,000
So that's that.

1576
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:36,000
So it comes up and around the left.

1577
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:37,000
That one or that?

1578
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:43,000
Oh my god, it could be any way it could be, and one of these.

1579
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:47,000
It's this one, right?

1580
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:52,000
You look at it the way it's supposed to be looked at.

1581
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Comes up around her left, her right thigh.

1582
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:05,000
Is it that one?

1583
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:06,000
That one first.

1584
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:11,000
That's obviously the top piece.

1585
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:18,000
That one has a little bit of a bump to it, though.

1586
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
It could be that one.

1587
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:25,000
Well, let me get some of these out.

1588
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:28,000
I need to get obviously the bottom one out.

1589
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
So I can't bring more than one.

1590
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
They're different colored ones.

1591
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Maybe it's the ones that are colored differently.

1592
02:50:55,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Okay.

1593
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:19,000
At least I have to go down.

1594
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:23,000
I'm like turning my head sideways.

1595
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
It's the litus one, right?

1596
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:26,000
Let's take a look.

1597
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Oh yeah, definitely.

1598
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:31,000
Definitely that one.

1599
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:38,000
I just want to make sure it was out.

1600
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Come back with your head.

1601
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Let's turn my head from side to side.

1602
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Shit, I'm going to use it to cut my head.

1603
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:46,000
No, I'm going to do it backwards.

1604
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:48,000
This needs to be right.

1605
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:51,000
That one has to switch with this one.

1606
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:52,000
We're ready to come out.

1607
02:52:52,000 --> 02:53:15,000
Come on out, all you.

1608
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:22,000
That one's next, right?

1609
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:53,000
Go that way.

1610
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Get out of my way.

1611
02:53:55,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Block.

1612
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Is that the one?

1613
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:04,000
That is the one.

1614
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Open the door.

1615
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:09,000
I got it.

1616
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:10,000
I got it.

1617
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:11,000
I just want to chill out.

1618
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:14,000
Hang on a second.

1619
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:15,000
I'm just calmed down.

1620
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:16,000
I got it.

1621
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:17,000
It's all right.

1622
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:21,000
Don't worry about it.

1623
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:34,000
I'm going to go to the area with another pump.

1624
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
I feel like the pumps matter.

1625
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:37,000
The colors of the pumps.

1626
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:38,000
This is a blue one.

1627
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:39,000
The one before this was purple.

1628
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Red, right?

1629
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:57,000
This is a really cool looking run, by the way.

1630
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:01,000
Anything to tell me, Mr.

1631
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:07,000
Best to consider outward solutions to troublesome problems.

1632
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Indeed.

1633
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Perhaps the answer is daring right-backage.

1634
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:16,000
Outside solutions, huh?

1635
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
Beware the intruder.

1636
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:24,000
He claims to share your goals yet seeks to destroy what you protect.

1637
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:27,000
Okay.

1638
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:33,000
A generous meal can often weigh heavily in your favor.

1639
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:40,000
Let's go.

1640
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Come on, Big, Big.

1641
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:48,000
So there's a monster in here, apparently, where somebody else is in here.

1642
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:55,000
That they're octopus to tell us more of a story.

1643
02:55:55,000 --> 02:56:02,000
I'm going to get to see another president.

1644
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:06,000
There's going to be another president, Anton here.

1645
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:13,000
If you guys are ready.

1646
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:14,000
What?

1647
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:17,000
That's all you got, Roosevelt?

1648
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Bully!

1649
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:27,000
Bully.

1650
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:37,000
So that's all I'm going to get from him is Bully.

1651
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:41,000
Pink, gray, pink, pink, gray.

1652
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:46,000
I'm just making sure I can show him these this again.

1653
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:49,000
He can fly.

1654
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
Pot, we're not going to do that yet.

1655
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:58,000
I'm going to look, see what this is on the wall.

1656
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:14,000
Okay, so you have to make one of the robot.

1657
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Well, let's simply look at what they look like.

1658
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
Let's try this one.

1659
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:35,000
This one has the thing in the top left.

1660
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
Guess I can't make that one.

1661
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
What about this one?

1662
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:42,000
Top left, bottom right.

1663
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:46,000
That's the right one, isn't it?

1664
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:47,000
What about the middle?

1665
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:53,000
Three on this and then that.

1666
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Wait, hold on, no.

1667
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
This one didn't have that right.

1668
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Here we go.

1669
02:57:57,000 --> 02:58:04,000
He's going to claw for a hand.

1670
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:10,000
The body is that triangle with this square on the right.

1671
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:16,000
I think that's the right one, right?

1672
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:27,000
The head is the knife sticking out of his neck and the pretzel on the left.

1673
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:33,000
There's no hole on the right.

1674
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:36,000
Let's try this one.

1675
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Nope.

1676
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:52,000
The side is the saw.

1677
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:57,000
That's right.

1678
02:58:57,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Is the bottom one wrong?

1679
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:04,000
Oh, the bottom one has the three.

1680
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:07,000
Yeah, this one is wrong.

1681
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:14,000
Is this one?

1682
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:21,000
One, two, two.

1683
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:26,000
Unless it's another right.

1684
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:32,000
No, it is.

1685
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:38,000
Right one's more curvy.

1686
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:42,000
Let's just take a look through this one.

1687
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Oh, is it a fist?

1688
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:48,000
No, it's like the glove.

1689
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
Nope, it's not that one.

1690
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:53,000
Okay, so it is not this robot.

1691
02:59:53,000 --> 03:00:00,000
It's not that one way over.

1692
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:03,000
More about.

1693
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:11,000
So we just did this one.

1694
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:17,000
Oh, it didn't.

1695
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:22,000
There's one line on his chest.

1696
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:31,000
Now it's the one.

1697
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
Is the head correct?

1698
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:36,000
Is the head of a head does.

1699
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:38,000
So that's the head is correct.

1700
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:45,000
The upper body has the line, the circle here, and then it's filled.

1701
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:48,000
Line, circle here, and it's filled.

1702
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:59,000
Yeah, that's right.

1703
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:00,000
That's right.

1704
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:04,000
One line, one line.

1705
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:05,000
One line, one line.

1706
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:08,000
Just make sure.

1707
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:12,000
All right, hold on.

1708
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:16,000
Drop the egg, please.

1709
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:23,000
Hey, it landed.

1710
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:27,000
Ooh.

1711
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:33,000
Okay.

1712
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:36,000
You know, it's good that I picked to do this one.

1713
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:39,000
Otherwise, I would have been here a long time, huh?

1714
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
This is the correct one.

1715
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:44,000
If I started, like, I'll start over here.

1716
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:50,000
I would have been here a while.

1717
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:53,000
Yeah.

1718
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Now why should he be able to eat?

1719
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:01,000
Should he fly out there?

1720
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:11,000
You can go in here, but I guess he's going to go in there.

1721
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:18,000
Octopus.

1722
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:21,000
Hey, look at that.

1723
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
Time for an octopus story, guys.

1724
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
I can't wait.

1725
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:28,000
That's a reverse bar.

1726
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,000
That's a reverse bar.

1727
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1728
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,000
That's what the arena makes.

1729
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:37,000
For the bar that didn't record on Basiotro,

1730
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:40,000
that's a new one.

1731
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:43,000
Over there.

1732
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:46,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1733
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:50,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1734
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:54,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1735
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:57,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1736
03:02:57,000 --> 03:03:01,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1737
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:05,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1738
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:08,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1739
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:11,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1740
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:14,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1741
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:17,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1742
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:20,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1743
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:23,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1744
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:26,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1745
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:29,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1746
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:32,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1747
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:35,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1748
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:38,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1749
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:41,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1750
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:44,000
I'm going to write it in my writing.

1751
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:48,000
We sure didn't change the language in the settings.

1752
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:53,000
That'd be funny.

1753
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
This one is...

1754
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:59,000
I don't know what color this octopus was,

1755
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:02,000
but we'll color the octopus's lips.

1756
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:05,000
Because to see the symbol above his head.

1757
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:10,000
That's a symbol that we need to write down.

1758
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:19,000
What would you do if someone gave you a million dollar donation on stream?

1759
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:24,000
I would immediately refund it.

1760
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:28,000
That's a scary amount of money.

1761
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:34,000
Get down here.

1762
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:46,000
Give me what you picked up.

1763
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:52,000
Take that.

1764
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:55,000
And the lever.

1765
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:01,000
Thank you.

1766
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:04,000
Let's go.

1767
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:10,000
Now is Peter Roosevelt going to tell me something?

1768
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Bully!

1769
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
Nope.

1770
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:19,000
He's still going to say Bully.

1771
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:25,000
Oh, shit.

1772
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:30,000
Not this again.

1773
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:37,000
Oh, no.

1774
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:40,000
Let me remember this.

1775
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:43,000
I really should have written it down.

1776
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
You know what I mean?

1777
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:48,000
I don't know.

1778
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:51,000
I don't remember.

1779
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:57,000
This is kind of closed.

1780
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:02,000
I didn't know what I was going to write down.

1781
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:06,000
I don't remember.

1782
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:09,000
I don't remember.

1783
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:14,000
This is kind of closed.

1784
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:20,000
I didn't know what I was going to write down.

1785
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:25,000
I think that's right.

1786
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:29,000
When I get this right, I'm writing this whole thing down.

1787
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:33,000
I'm going to have to do the whole thing.

1788
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:39,000
Every watch the broadcast.

1789
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:44,000
Don't forget to subscribe to my channel.

1790
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:48,000
I'm going to have to do the whole thing.

1791
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:53,000
I'm going to have to do the whole thing.

1792
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:57,000
I'm going to have to do the whole thing.

1793
03:06:57,000 --> 03:07:01,000
I'm going to have to do the whole thing.

1794
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:08,000
Don't fall off.

1795
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:12,000
Okay, got it.

1796
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
I want to write this down.

1797
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:17,000
It's gone.

1798
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:20,000
Can't write it down.

1799
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:26,000
Creepy.

1800
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:32,000
It's okay.

1801
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:37,000
Pea.

1802
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:42,000
You look funny.

1803
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:48,000
No!

1804
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:51,000
Still the baby.

1805
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:59,000
We're going to get peed back.

1806
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:03,000
I'm kind of glad that I don't have the baby anymore.

1807
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:10,000
Because it means I don't have to do the song thing anymore.

1808
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:13,000
What are we doing?

1809
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:18,000
Something before that guy takes stole my baby.

1810
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:24,000
I can power this now.

1811
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:30,000
Please plug it into the device.

1812
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:36,000
I don't have to do it.

1813
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:41,000
I can't do it.

1814
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:47,000
آپ.

1815
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:53,000
This is the neverhood spiritual successor.

1816
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:59,000
This is not a sequel to the neverhood.

1817
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:03,000
It's a direct sequel.

1818
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:10,000
Do you have anything new to tell me now?

1819
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:19,000
Nope.

1820
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:23,000
Let's go upstairs.

1821
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:38,000
I can't go down.

1822
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:47,000
Go up.

1823
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:50,000
Purple face.

1824
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:56,000
I can't go down.

1825
03:09:56,000 --> 03:10:02,000
I can't go down.

1826
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:08,000
I can't go down.

1827
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:14,000
I can't go down.

1828
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:20,000
One of these is definitely bill from the neverhood.

1829
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:25,000
Me too.

1830
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:38,000
Try to tell.

1831
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:43,000
Nice plus.

1832
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:49,000
I can't go down here.

1833
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:54,000
Square.

1834
03:10:54,000 --> 03:11:03,000
What are the odd symbols?

1835
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:08,000
Within a box.

1836
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:15,000
Two lines.

1837
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:22,000
Done.

1838
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:32,000
Okay.

1839
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:37,000
Cub.

1840
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:42,000
Try this down too.

1841
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:49,000
More symbols.

1842
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:56,000
More symbols.

1843
03:11:56,000 --> 03:12:10,000
More symbols.

1844
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:14,000
Oh, what?

1845
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:20,000
I can't go down.

1846
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:27,000
I can't go down.

1847
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:34,000
I can't go down.

1848
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:38,000
I can't go down.

1849
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:44,000
I can't go down.

1850
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:50,000
That way.

1851
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:56,000
I like keeping a notebook.

1852
03:12:56,000 --> 03:13:03,000
I want to keep my detective notebook.

1853
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:09,000
Okay.

1854
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:16,000
That's the solution.

1855
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:24,000
I told you that was such a good lucky guess to do that one first.

1856
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:30,000
Now we have another one of these.

1857
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:37,000
Oh, boy.

1858
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:42,000
Not even sure there's a way to tell.

1859
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:48,000
Let's move all this out of the way to see.

1860
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:53,000
Is it baby?

1861
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:59,000
Did he scratch?

1862
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:06,000
Didn't he scratch off the door?

1863
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:11,000
Maybe it's there on the door.

1864
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:16,000
Let's check behind all these.

1865
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:22,000
No.

1866
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:29,000
Well, it's somewhere.

1867
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:33,000
It's definitely the guy holding.

1868
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:37,000
There's a bunch of different faces here.

1869
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:41,000
There's like two or three versions of the same face.

1870
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:47,000
I can't figure it out.

1871
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:53,000
It looks like dark winged duck.

1872
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:59,000
Yeah, I'm going to have to come back to this, I think.

1873
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:06,000
There's no way I can do that without knowing what the right picture is.

1874
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:11,000
Maybe I can go in here.

1875
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:16,000
Maybe the picture's in here.

1876
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:22,000
That would sure be swell.

1877
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:30,000
There's the path.

1878
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:34,000
Gotta write that down.

1879
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:38,000
No, you know what, fuck it.

1880
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:42,000
This is what I'm going to take a picture of.

1881
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:45,000
This is the one I'm going to take the picture of.

1882
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:49,000
I went through all that trouble of describing the notebook.

1883
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:52,000
No, no, no, I'm going to use like the notebook.

1884
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:57,000
The notebook is like, it's so key.

1885
03:15:57,000 --> 03:16:02,000
It's got to be the notebook.

1886
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:07,000
I'm going to take a picture with my iPhone.

1887
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:12,000
Jeter.

1888
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:16,000
Wait, was there anything else in this room?

1889
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:18,000
You want me to do it?

1890
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:22,000
If I draw this, are you kidding me?

1891
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:26,000
What was this?

1892
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:31,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hold on.

1893
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:40,000
This one, when it was filled in with the plus and minus there.

1894
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:45,000
Good thing I brought it down.

1895
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:48,000
And then where is it?

1896
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:52,000
The box in the middle.

1897
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:53,000
This one.

1898
03:16:53,000 --> 03:17:00,000
Is there another one that's not filled in?

1899
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:04,000
That's all correct.

1900
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:09,000
What does that do?

1901
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:12,000
Shouldn't this do something?

1902
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:19,000
Is there an indication that I just did this?

1903
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:27,000
It was already on the second sequence.

1904
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:31,000
That's the thing.

1905
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:36,000
That's the way that I raised my heart.

1906
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:40,000
I'm going to go to the second round.

1907
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:45,000
I'm going to go to the second round.

1908
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:50,000
I'm going to go to the second round.

1909
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:54,000
I'm going to go to the second round.

1910
03:17:54,000 --> 03:18:03,000
I'm going to say it on the head, drafted a soon red brought to send.

1911
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:10,000
What was that?

1912
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:14,000
I can't move this anymore.

1913
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:21,000
There we go.

1914
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:24,000
I don't know.

1915
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:31,000
I mean, I guess.

1916
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:34,000
Just for fun.

1917
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:38,000
I'm going to try the other one.

1918
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:44,000
Just make sure I didn't miss anything.

1919
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:47,000
That's the other one.

1920
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:54,000
I think it was on this one to begin with.

1921
03:18:54,000 --> 03:19:08,000
Blink, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank.

1922
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:15,000
This is the right.

1923
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:22,000
I'm going to do it.

1924
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:33,000
Everyone's doing the triangles.

1925
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:36,000
Maybe that did change the path.

1926
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:47,000
I'm getting very hungry.

1927
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:57,000
I'm going to do this.

1928
03:19:57,000 --> 03:20:00,000
He's spitting something out.

1929
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:06,000
I'm going to do this.

1930
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:12,000
Let me look at this picture of Dark Wing Duck.

1931
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:15,000
The eyes, the head has.

1932
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:20,000
I can't even see.

1933
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:23,000
I think this is the right head.

1934
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:28,000
I think.

1935
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:35,000
Is that the right head?

1936
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:36,000
Yes.

1937
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:43,000
That is the right head.

1938
03:20:43,000 --> 03:20:46,000
Where's the eyes?

1939
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:49,000
This is going to be hard for me to figure this shit out.

1940
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:51,000
Those are not right.

1941
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:57,000
Where are the right eyes?

1942
03:20:57,000 --> 03:21:04,000
He's looking to the left.

1943
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:07,000
I don't want to screw this one up.

1944
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:13,000
Let's put it around.

1945
03:21:13,000 --> 03:21:21,000
It could be.

1946
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:24,000
Hold on.

1947
03:21:24,000 --> 03:21:30,000
It needs to go up because this doesn't fit down here.

1948
03:21:30,000 --> 03:21:34,000
God, this is making my head hurt.

1949
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:39,000
There are only three eyes.

1950
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:42,000
Where's the helmet?

1951
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:47,000
Where's the right head?

1952
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:49,000
Let me get that over there.

1953
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:53,000
This is going to be very slow because I need to make sure I'm doing this correctly.

1954
03:21:53,000 --> 03:22:03,000
I can't even see.

1955
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:07,000
I don't even know what piece of the body that is.

1956
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:20,000
Is that his hands?

1957
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:36,000
No, this has got to go up this way.

1958
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:40,000
That's the right head, for sure.

1959
03:22:40,000 --> 03:22:43,000
That is not the right eyes because it's the wrong way.

1960
03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:49,000
It's really just determines how to match it up the right way.

1961
03:22:49,000 --> 03:22:59,000
The right eyes are the ones that are down here.

1962
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:09,000
Let's just see.

1963
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:11,000
Flip this upside down.

1964
03:23:11,000 --> 03:23:18,000
Those are the right ones.

1965
03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:22,000
I'm going to get those back up.

1966
03:23:22,000 --> 03:23:25,000
Seeing all these pieces are really messing with my brain.

1967
03:23:25,000 --> 03:23:30,000
These have to come back down.

1968
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:45,000
I'm going to get that one out of the bottom though.

1969
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:55,000
I'm just going to do this piece by piece.

1970
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:57,000
I'll figure it out later.

1971
03:23:57,000 --> 03:24:00,000
I think, hold on.

1972
03:24:00,000 --> 03:24:01,000
Oh, shit.

1973
03:24:01,000 --> 03:24:05,000
I lost the picture.

1974
03:24:05,000 --> 03:24:14,000
The body's hand comes across.

1975
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:21,000
This is going to be very, very annoying.

1976
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:23,000
I need the mouth.

1977
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:26,000
This mouth has this leg.

1978
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:30,000
That's it right there, right?

1979
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:35,000
I think.

1980
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:39,000
Pretty sure that's the right mouth.

1981
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:43,000
Let's see.

1982
03:24:43,000 --> 03:25:02,000
Yep, that's correct.

1983
03:25:02,000 --> 03:25:06,000
We're getting there.

1984
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:07,000
We're getting closer.

1985
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:16,000
The right way is the right way.

1986
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:24,000
It's hard to tell what the hand has even gone the right way here.

1987
03:25:24,000 --> 03:25:27,000
I think it's the one down the bottom.

1988
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:33,000
This one.

1989
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:45,000
Yes, it is.

1990
03:25:45,000 --> 03:25:47,000
What's the last one?

1991
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:54,000
The hand coming down on the right.

1992
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:57,000
It's like fingers and shit.

1993
03:25:57,000 --> 03:25:59,000
Is it this one?

1994
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:02,000
Is it the one that I just had?

1995
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:06,000
No.

1996
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:13,000
It's definitely not this one.

1997
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:15,000
There it is.

1998
03:26:15,000 --> 03:26:21,000
That was kind of strange.

1999
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:30,000
No power.

2000
03:26:30,000 --> 03:26:33,000
No power.

2001
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:37,000
I did pick up a power thing though.

2002
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:47,000
I want to see what that potentially changed when I move to the blocks.

2003
03:26:47,000 --> 03:26:50,000
I did change all those blocks that were over here.

2004
03:26:50,000 --> 03:26:53,000
And boom.

2005
03:26:53,000 --> 03:27:01,000
Bottom boom.

2006
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:11,000
Hey, look power.

2007
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:14,000
I'm assuming I can put this in here and then there will be power.

2008
03:27:14,000 --> 03:27:20,000
I'm assuming I can put this in here.

2009
03:27:20,000 --> 03:27:27,000
I'm assuming I can put this in here.

2010
03:27:27,000 --> 03:27:37,000
I'm assuming I can put this in here.

2011
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:44,000
I'm assuming I can put this in here.

2012
03:27:44,000 --> 03:27:51,000
I'm assuming I can put this in here.

2013
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:58,000
I'm assuming I can put this in here.

2014
03:27:58,000 --> 03:28:04,000
I'm assuming I can put this in here.

2015
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:21,000
Okay, well, the first octopus was the one with the rectangle.

2016
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:31,000
So it's in the second one we saw was the, let me see, servitude, family, hope, honor.

2017
03:28:31,000 --> 03:28:41,000
Let's go in the right way.

2018
03:28:41,000 --> 03:28:57,000
I'm just, I'm going to write underneath them, servitude, family, this one is hope, servitude, honor.

2019
03:28:57,000 --> 03:29:08,000
Okay, bye-bye.

2020
03:29:08,000 --> 03:29:24,000
That should allow us to get in the door that we just had.

2021
03:29:24,000 --> 03:29:34,000
I'm actually curious about something.

2022
03:29:34,000 --> 03:29:47,000
I'm going to go back down there, but I want to see what's in this room over here.

2023
03:29:47,000 --> 03:29:55,000
Oh, damn.

2024
03:29:55,000 --> 03:29:57,000
I just looked at the chat.

2025
03:29:57,000 --> 03:30:02,000
Now, maybe they're speaking English now instead of, okay, that's kind of cool.

2026
03:30:02,000 --> 03:30:11,000
That's what that did.

2027
03:30:11,000 --> 03:30:14,000
Yeah, yep, I can, I'm going to be able to understand them now.

2028
03:30:14,000 --> 03:30:17,000
So this is, this is, this is cool.

2029
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:19,000
This is cool. This is going to tell the whole story.

2030
03:30:19,000 --> 03:30:22,000
So we need to do it in order.

2031
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:24,000
This is not the right order.

2032
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:33,000
But I mean, this right here is the last part of the story right here.

2033
03:30:33,000 --> 03:30:35,000
You have made it far.

2034
03:30:35,000 --> 03:30:40,000
Mother and Father must be pleased with your courage and honor.

2035
03:30:40,000 --> 03:30:51,000
Yet, always for not without saving the child, Vognoth has her and is building a machine to extract her power.

2036
03:30:51,000 --> 03:30:54,000
Of a process she will never survive.

2037
03:30:54,000 --> 03:31:00,000
Takes us, it's the final piece you will need.

2038
03:31:00,000 --> 03:31:06,000
Just spit it down on me.

2039
03:31:06,000 --> 03:31:09,000
So what is it? No, I got to, I got to go listen to the other part of the story.

2040
03:31:09,000 --> 03:31:11,000
I got to go all the way back.

2041
03:31:11,000 --> 03:31:15,000
I'm going to talk about backtrack.

2042
03:31:15,000 --> 03:31:20,000
You think, you think we're going to backtrack to the very beginning?

2043
03:31:20,000 --> 03:31:31,000
Exactly what we're going to do.

2044
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:35,000
We're going all the way back.

2045
03:31:35,000 --> 03:31:40,000
Because I want to see, I want to see from the beginning.

2046
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:43,000
You guys are ready.

2047
03:31:43,000 --> 03:31:47,000
Hope you guys are ready to go all the way back.

2048
03:31:47,000 --> 03:31:56,000
If I even remember how to get there, this is going to take a long time.

2049
03:31:56,000 --> 03:32:12,000
Okay, no, I didn't do anything there.

2050
03:32:12,000 --> 03:32:20,000
So where is the last, let me just hold on a second.

2051
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:23,000
Flip it in my notes here.

2052
03:32:23,000 --> 03:32:35,000
Big, big, say, I have to go back.

2053
03:32:35,000 --> 03:32:37,000
Can we even go all the way back?

2054
03:32:37,000 --> 03:32:41,000
I think we can. I'm pretty sure we can.

2055
03:32:41,000 --> 03:32:47,000
Good luck.

2056
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:52,000
Big, big change it back to normal and you.

2057
03:32:52,000 --> 03:33:00,000
Look at the dog.

2058
03:33:00,000 --> 03:33:04,000
Can I get over on the other side?

2059
03:33:04,000 --> 03:33:06,000
There was a little like a.

2060
03:33:06,000 --> 03:33:08,000
I can go down.

2061
03:33:08,000 --> 03:33:21,000
I didn't even do this.

2062
03:33:21,000 --> 03:33:26,000
Oh no.

2063
03:33:26,000 --> 03:33:28,000
Guys.

2064
03:33:28,000 --> 03:33:31,000
Please stop him.

2065
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:37,000
I'll not waste just through here.

2066
03:33:37,000 --> 03:33:40,000
This symbol was on the wall a while back.

2067
03:33:40,000 --> 03:33:42,000
This was somewhere too.

2068
03:33:42,000 --> 03:33:44,000
Shit.

2069
03:33:44,000 --> 03:33:46,000
I didn't write him down.

2070
03:33:46,000 --> 03:33:48,000
I didn't write him down.

2071
03:33:48,000 --> 03:33:49,000
That's my downfall.

2072
03:33:49,000 --> 03:33:50,000
That didn't do it.

2073
03:33:50,000 --> 03:33:51,000
That was the downfall.

2074
03:33:51,000 --> 03:33:54,000
Didn't write these ones down.

2075
03:33:54,000 --> 03:33:56,000
But let's just go in and see what happens.

2076
03:33:56,000 --> 03:33:57,000
What's going on here?

2077
03:33:57,000 --> 03:34:01,000
Let's just go through.

2078
03:34:01,000 --> 03:34:13,000
This is the baby.

2079
03:34:13,000 --> 03:34:15,000
Can I?

2080
03:34:15,000 --> 03:34:16,000
He.

2081
03:34:16,000 --> 03:34:18,000
Not so fast.

2082
03:34:18,000 --> 03:34:19,000
Brother of mine.

2083
03:34:19,000 --> 03:34:20,000
Vognon.

2084
03:34:20,000 --> 03:34:21,000
Come on.

2085
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:22,000
Let's be reasonable.

2086
03:34:22,000 --> 03:34:24,000
You've got to let me get her out of that.

2087
03:34:24,000 --> 03:34:25,000
Thing.

2088
03:34:25,000 --> 03:34:26,000
Oh no.

2089
03:34:26,000 --> 03:34:27,000
I need your power.

2090
03:34:27,000 --> 03:34:28,000
Wasted on her anyhow.

2091
03:34:28,000 --> 03:34:30,000
I'll put it to real use.

2092
03:34:30,000 --> 03:34:35,000
Vognon, don't.

2093
03:34:35,000 --> 03:34:36,000
Sorry.

2094
03:34:36,000 --> 03:34:44,000
Too late.

2095
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:45,000
What the?

2096
03:34:45,000 --> 03:34:51,000
Well, that was easy.

2097
03:34:51,000 --> 03:34:54,000
Oh shit.

2098
03:34:54,000 --> 03:35:03,000
Please kill my dog.

2099
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:13,000
Don't worry.

2100
03:35:13,000 --> 03:35:15,000
I've got you.

2101
03:35:15,000 --> 03:35:18,000
I've got you.

2102
03:35:18,000 --> 03:35:19,000
Huh?

2103
03:35:33,000 --> 03:35:40,000
I feel like we're not focusing on the fact that my dog is just instant.

2104
03:35:40,000 --> 03:35:49,000
The dog that's been with me the whole game is dead.

2105
03:35:49,000 --> 03:35:53,000
What the hell?

2106
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:58,000
What about it?

2107
03:35:58,000 --> 03:35:59,000
Okay.

2108
03:35:59,000 --> 03:36:00,000
Big, big.

2109
03:36:00,000 --> 03:36:05,000
Rest in peace.

2110
03:36:05,000 --> 03:36:10,000
Here are the last piece of power.

2111
03:36:10,000 --> 03:36:27,000
I can actually turn this on now.

2112
03:36:27,000 --> 03:36:32,000
Huh?

2113
03:36:32,000 --> 03:36:34,000
How do I even fill the?

2114
03:36:34,000 --> 03:36:36,000
I'm going to hope.

2115
03:36:36,000 --> 03:36:40,000
Serve it to an honor.

2116
03:36:40,000 --> 03:36:41,000
Mustache guy.

2117
03:36:41,000 --> 03:36:46,000
Grab with a mustache.

2118
03:36:46,000 --> 03:36:47,000
Oh, okay.

2119
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:56,000
Drag it.

2120
03:36:56,000 --> 03:37:06,000
Yeah, the symbols.

2121
03:37:06,000 --> 03:37:14,000
I feel like I need to watch the cut scenes again.

2122
03:37:14,000 --> 03:37:18,000
Let's go back to the first octopus.

2123
03:37:18,000 --> 03:37:21,000
That's where we're going to begin with.

2124
03:37:21,000 --> 03:37:28,000
Is this the first octopus?

2125
03:37:28,000 --> 03:37:31,000
So this is octopus number one.

2126
03:37:31,000 --> 03:37:34,000
This is octopus number one.

2127
03:37:34,000 --> 03:37:39,000
Let's see what he has to say.

2128
03:37:39,000 --> 03:37:40,000
Welcome.

2129
03:37:40,000 --> 03:37:41,000
I must tell you.

2130
03:37:41,000 --> 03:37:48,000
In service to father, my obligator kin and I have seen much of these grand walls.

2131
03:37:48,000 --> 03:37:54,000
Most of it glory yet some tragic love.

2132
03:37:54,000 --> 03:38:02,000
It is the penance bureau flag when you now find yourself in tune in the fortress on the cross.

2133
03:38:02,000 --> 03:38:08,000
Create but father's one home or science magic pretty well and servitude.

2134
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:09,000
That's sir.

2135
03:38:09,000 --> 03:38:10,000
Fuck.

2136
03:38:10,000 --> 03:38:11,000
In honor.

2137
03:38:11,000 --> 03:38:13,000
We enjoy a peaceful system.

2138
03:38:13,000 --> 03:38:14,000
I got it.

2139
03:38:14,000 --> 03:38:17,000
I'm the long-lost, wandering yellow sword.

2140
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:21,000
And other dangers and indigenous to serial five.

2141
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:25,000
Then one day without warning, how did you come up?

2142
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:39,000
I felt like you were attacked by a fierce warrior who while lighting ultimate power, possessed intelligence, is killed and punished in symbolic form and regents defense.

2143
03:38:39,000 --> 03:38:41,000
Father and mother.

2144
03:38:41,000 --> 03:38:44,000
Father and mother.

2145
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:49,000
All in need is hope, servitude.

2146
03:38:49,000 --> 03:38:54,000
A lost soul is taken by ego and envy.

2147
03:38:54,000 --> 03:39:01,000
So the power of our power for his own gain and strong health and the key to this power.

2148
03:39:01,000 --> 03:39:06,000
The power of the poor is greater than the last.

2149
03:39:06,000 --> 03:39:10,000
Let's jump down by his phone.

2150
03:39:10,000 --> 03:39:17,000
Here in our power.

2151
03:39:17,000 --> 03:39:20,000
Okay.

2152
03:39:20,000 --> 03:39:24,000
That guy comes once the power of the armored crock fortress.

2153
03:39:24,000 --> 03:39:27,000
Servitude is the X with the square with little lines on it.

2154
03:39:27,000 --> 03:39:32,000
Each one of these sentient octopi are going to give me one of those.

2155
03:39:32,000 --> 03:39:33,000
So that's the first one.

2156
03:39:33,000 --> 03:39:36,000
We're going to go to the second one.

2157
03:39:36,000 --> 03:39:40,000
So that this is the servitude.

2158
03:39:40,000 --> 03:39:43,000
And I got servitude from the rectangle.

2159
03:39:43,000 --> 03:39:45,000
I remember that.

2160
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:49,000
There's no one can stop you fucking meds.

2161
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:52,000
Seriously.

2162
03:39:52,000 --> 03:39:55,000
Okay, so now what was the second one?

2163
03:39:55,000 --> 03:40:00,000
Second octopus is this way.

2164
03:40:00,000 --> 03:40:03,000
I got to pee again.

2165
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:24,000
What?

2166
03:40:24,000 --> 03:40:27,000
I just hurt.

2167
03:40:27,000 --> 03:40:31,000
Did he just hear the dog?

2168
03:40:31,000 --> 03:40:36,000
Oh yeah, I have multiple pieces of paper.

2169
03:40:36,000 --> 03:40:40,000
Which is all over the place.

2170
03:40:40,000 --> 03:40:42,000
I'm hungry too.

2171
03:40:42,000 --> 03:40:45,000
I feel like I'm pretty close to the end though.

2172
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:49,000
In the next maybe half hour 45.

2173
03:40:49,000 --> 03:40:55,000
Okay.

2174
03:40:55,000 --> 03:40:59,000
What was the second octopus down around this way, right?

2175
03:40:59,000 --> 03:41:13,000
Because this is the second area to go to.

2176
03:41:13,000 --> 03:41:26,000
Beak, beak.

2177
03:41:26,000 --> 03:41:29,000
How many bugs have I've actually seen?

2178
03:41:29,000 --> 03:41:33,000
Believe it or not, I heard this game had a lot of technical problems with it.

2179
03:41:33,000 --> 03:41:35,000
I don't think I've seen any.

2180
03:41:35,000 --> 03:41:39,000
I don't think I've seen one technical bug with this game.

2181
03:41:39,000 --> 03:41:42,000
Why is this block?

2182
03:41:42,000 --> 03:41:47,000
Is this a block?

2183
03:41:47,000 --> 03:41:51,000
Is this a block?

2184
03:41:51,000 --> 03:41:53,000
Okay.

2185
03:41:53,000 --> 03:41:57,000
Why is this a block?

2186
03:41:57,000 --> 03:42:00,000
That's unfortunate.

2187
03:42:00,000 --> 03:42:03,000
Yeah, the only bug I've seen was with audio.

2188
03:42:03,000 --> 03:42:09,000
There was one bug in like the four hours or whatever I've been playing this game.

2189
03:42:09,000 --> 03:42:16,000
I have to go down.

2190
03:42:16,000 --> 03:42:33,000
Have I even gone this way?

2191
03:42:33,000 --> 03:42:40,000
I don't even remember.

2192
03:42:40,000 --> 03:42:49,000
Here we are.

2193
03:42:49,000 --> 03:42:51,000
Now which one is this?

2194
03:42:51,000 --> 03:42:53,000
Is an octopus in here?

2195
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:58,000
Because it's the third one or the fourth one?

2196
03:42:58,000 --> 03:43:05,000
This is the second octopus.

2197
03:43:05,000 --> 03:43:06,000
I believe.

2198
03:43:06,000 --> 03:43:08,000
Let's get it.

2199
03:43:08,000 --> 03:43:10,000
I've got my hands ready.

2200
03:43:10,000 --> 03:43:16,000
My activator sibling told you of the attack upon Spiro 5 I presume.

2201
03:43:16,000 --> 03:43:19,000
Allow me to continue.

2202
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:21,000
Our fortress had been breached.

2203
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:24,000
The father was prepared.

2204
03:43:24,000 --> 03:43:34,000
The father was prepared.

2205
03:43:34,000 --> 03:43:39,000
The father was prepared.

2206
03:43:39,000 --> 03:43:47,000
The father was prepared.

2207
03:43:47,000 --> 03:43:57,000
The father was prepared.

2208
03:43:57,000 --> 03:44:04,000
The father was prepared.

2209
03:44:04,000 --> 03:44:13,000
The father was prepared.

2210
03:44:13,000 --> 03:44:22,000
The father was prepared.

2211
03:44:22,000 --> 03:44:24,000
It's not heard about the3 circle.

2212
03:44:24,000 --> 03:44:28,000
All right.

2213
03:44:28,000 --> 03:44:30,000
We need the servitude.

2214
03:44:30,000 --> 03:44:32,000
What will the other teams need?

2215
03:44:32,000 --> 03:44:41,000
The six?

2216
03:44:41,000 --> 03:44:50,000
It's not the right way.

2217
03:44:50,000 --> 03:44:55,000
Hope and honor of the last two.

2218
03:44:55,000 --> 03:45:03,000
I feel like I need to suck something up this.

2219
03:45:03,000 --> 03:45:04,000
But it wasn't there.

2220
03:45:04,000 --> 03:45:07,000
Remember the button I pressed?

2221
03:45:07,000 --> 03:45:14,000
And it made the vacuum sound.

2222
03:45:14,000 --> 03:45:15,000
Am I crazy?

2223
03:45:15,000 --> 03:45:17,000
Remember when peak peak was up there and there was a button to press and it made the vacuum

2224
03:45:17,000 --> 03:45:19,000
sound?

2225
03:45:19,000 --> 03:45:28,000
I don't know.

2226
03:45:28,000 --> 03:45:30,000
Where's the dog?

2227
03:45:30,000 --> 03:45:37,000
I think you might have missed what happened earlier, unfortunately.

2228
03:45:37,000 --> 03:45:44,000
I don't know.

2229
03:45:44,000 --> 03:45:52,000
I don't know.

2230
03:45:52,000 --> 03:45:57,000
I just picked down the vine.

2231
03:45:57,000 --> 03:46:03,000
Down the vine.

2232
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:04,000
What was out here?

2233
03:46:04,000 --> 03:46:06,000
I forget where the hell I was.

2234
03:46:07,000 --> 03:46:08,000
Was it this way?

2235
03:46:08,000 --> 03:46:12,000
I mean, hold on.

2236
03:46:12,000 --> 03:46:14,000
Because through this door is...

2237
03:46:14,000 --> 03:46:19,000
Yeah, this is where he flies up and hits the button.

2238
03:46:19,000 --> 03:46:26,000
So we're going to go down here.

2239
03:46:26,000 --> 03:46:27,000
Let's continue.

2240
03:46:27,000 --> 03:46:32,000
Did I miss one of the sentient octopus people?

2241
03:46:32,000 --> 03:46:39,000
I feel like I missed somebody.

2242
03:46:39,000 --> 03:46:47,000
I forgot which way to go.

2243
03:46:47,000 --> 03:46:54,000
That's not that way.

2244
03:46:54,000 --> 03:47:01,000
There's the 50-50.

2245
03:47:01,000 --> 03:47:08,000
There's the 5% 50.

2246
03:47:08,000 --> 03:47:26,000
Go on, get out of here, get up.

2247
03:47:26,000 --> 03:47:28,000
Speed it up, speed it up.

2248
03:47:28,000 --> 03:47:31,000
Anything change up here with these weird birds?

2249
03:47:31,000 --> 03:47:34,000
I swear it's going to be like...

2250
03:47:34,000 --> 03:47:39,000
And remember the 5 birds of our ancestors.

2251
03:47:39,000 --> 03:47:45,000
Pinky, Grayson, Pink Mondo, Pink Modo and Gray Sanibi.

2252
03:47:45,000 --> 03:47:46,000
Remember their names.

2253
03:47:46,000 --> 03:47:50,000
I swear it got to be something like that.

2254
03:47:50,000 --> 03:48:02,000
Whatever.

2255
03:48:02,000 --> 03:48:09,000
Let's go.

2256
03:48:09,000 --> 03:48:12,000
Derma is auto-okay.

2257
03:48:12,000 --> 03:48:16,000
I had a dream where you left him outside and he had to eat his own poof.

2258
03:48:16,000 --> 03:48:22,000
He's right here and he's well fed, don't worry.

2259
03:48:22,000 --> 03:48:25,000
That's an odd dream to have.

2260
03:48:25,000 --> 03:48:27,000
Derma, is your dog alright?

2261
03:48:27,000 --> 03:48:29,000
Get out there.

2262
03:48:29,000 --> 03:48:31,000
What are you doing, man?

2263
03:48:31,000 --> 03:48:36,000
Okay, let's activate it again.

2264
03:48:36,000 --> 03:48:37,000
Uh-oh.

2265
03:48:37,000 --> 03:48:54,000
Okay, good.

2266
03:48:54,000 --> 03:49:01,000
Let's see what you have to say.

2267
03:49:01,000 --> 03:49:05,000
Did I already do this one?

2268
03:49:05,000 --> 03:49:08,000
Did I already do this one?

2269
03:49:08,000 --> 03:49:09,000
No, I didn't.

2270
03:49:09,000 --> 03:49:10,000
Okay, here we go.

2271
03:49:10,000 --> 03:49:11,000
This is the... I missed one.

2272
03:49:11,000 --> 03:49:16,000
But we'll get it though.

2273
03:49:16,000 --> 03:49:18,000
You know a botknot.

2274
03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:20,000
You know the attack.

2275
03:49:20,000 --> 03:49:23,000
Allow me to tell you what you're getting at.

2276
03:49:23,000 --> 03:49:27,000
Botknot, believing mother was dead, began his search for the child.

2277
03:49:27,000 --> 03:49:31,000
But mother was still alive in a patch.

2278
03:49:31,000 --> 03:49:35,000
She had used the soul transfer device to insert her being into the fortress,

2279
03:49:35,000 --> 03:49:41,000
the first of a two step process which would act to make fathers defend his thickness.

2280
03:49:41,000 --> 03:49:45,000
Yes, she had narrowly escaped botknot's blast.

2281
03:49:45,000 --> 03:49:51,000
But the soul transfer device was destroyed forever trapping her within the walls of Warncroft.

2282
03:49:52,000 --> 03:49:58,000
The original plan was for father to use the soul transfer device to complete the first step.

2283
03:49:58,000 --> 03:50:04,000
He would insert himself into a armor crop, while mother would perform the second step.

2284
03:50:04,000 --> 03:50:09,000
How rough the machinery, the control panel located it in the ample room.

2285
03:50:09,000 --> 03:50:16,000
However, with father killed by botknot, mother's only option was to inhabit the fortress herself.

2286
03:50:17,000 --> 03:50:21,000
And hope that father's spirit could somehow find a way to activate the console.

2287
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:22,000
Where's it?

2288
03:50:22,000 --> 03:50:23,000
Unlikely, yes.

2289
03:50:23,000 --> 03:50:26,000
But this was her only hope.

2290
03:50:26,000 --> 03:50:27,000
There it is.

2291
03:50:27,000 --> 03:50:30,000
Thankfully father's spirit appeared to have found a way.

2292
03:50:32,000 --> 03:50:35,000
You know what's really funny about this?

2293
03:50:35,000 --> 03:50:39,000
Star was in this call like four hours ago.

2294
03:50:39,000 --> 03:50:45,000
And he said, wouldn't it be funny if all the things that these octopus were saying

2295
03:50:45,000 --> 03:50:48,000
was just how to beat the game.

2296
03:50:48,000 --> 03:50:51,000
And he called it.

2297
03:50:51,000 --> 03:50:52,000
So, yeah.

2298
03:50:52,000 --> 03:50:54,000
Good job.

2299
03:50:54,000 --> 03:50:56,000
Good for you.

2300
03:50:56,000 --> 03:50:59,000
Now all we're missing is honor.

2301
03:51:08,000 --> 03:51:12,000
Honor and then we can pull the thing off the crystal.

2302
03:51:16,000 --> 03:51:18,000
That one was the...

2303
03:51:18,000 --> 03:51:19,000
You know what?

2304
03:51:19,000 --> 03:51:21,000
I haven't been doing.

2305
03:51:21,000 --> 03:51:22,000
Shit.

2306
03:51:22,000 --> 03:51:24,000
I haven't been...

2307
03:51:24,000 --> 03:51:25,000
Oh no, hold on.

2308
03:51:25,000 --> 03:51:27,000
I gotta go back.

2309
03:51:27,000 --> 03:51:33,000
I need to write down what the symbol was above that octopi head.

2310
03:51:36,000 --> 03:51:40,000
Because I feel like I'm gonna need to know that.

2311
03:51:46,000 --> 03:51:50,000
So that was the piece facing this way.

2312
03:51:52,000 --> 03:51:55,000
Isn't that was hope?

2313
03:51:56,000 --> 03:52:00,000
I didn't write down which one was above the one that was family.

2314
03:52:00,000 --> 03:52:02,000
Unfortunately.

2315
03:52:02,000 --> 03:52:05,000
Shut up Bart.

2316
03:52:05,000 --> 03:52:08,000
I was gonna move.

2317
03:52:08,000 --> 03:52:10,000
Oh man.

2318
03:52:10,000 --> 03:52:13,000
I'm gonna move.

2319
03:52:13,000 --> 03:52:16,000
I'm gonna move.

2320
03:52:16,000 --> 03:52:20,000
I'm gonna move.

2321
03:52:20,000 --> 03:52:23,000
I'm gonna move.

2322
03:52:23,000 --> 03:52:26,000
I'm gonna move.

2323
03:52:38,000 --> 03:52:41,000
Keep going.

2324
03:52:45,000 --> 03:52:47,000
Didn't I already see this one though?

2325
03:52:47,000 --> 03:52:48,000
Did I?

2326
03:52:48,000 --> 03:52:50,000
I must have missed one.

2327
03:52:54,000 --> 03:52:55,000
No.

2328
03:52:55,000 --> 03:52:56,000
Ah, come on.

2329
03:52:56,000 --> 03:52:59,000
That's annoying.

2330
03:53:03,000 --> 03:53:06,000
Hold me up.

2331
03:53:19,000 --> 03:53:20,000
So this is the one...

2332
03:53:20,000 --> 03:53:21,000
Was this servitude?

2333
03:53:21,000 --> 03:53:22,000
No.

2334
03:53:22,000 --> 03:53:24,000
This one is...

2335
03:53:24,000 --> 03:53:25,000
What was this one?

2336
03:53:25,000 --> 03:53:26,000
Was this family?

2337
03:53:32,000 --> 03:53:33,000
There it is.

2338
03:53:49,000 --> 03:53:51,000
Already got it.

2339
03:53:52,000 --> 03:53:54,000
So make sure I got it right.

2340
03:53:54,000 --> 03:53:56,000
You have made it far.

2341
03:53:56,000 --> 03:54:00,000
Mother and father must be pleased with your courage and honor.

2342
03:54:00,000 --> 03:54:02,000
The square with the...

2343
03:54:02,000 --> 03:54:05,000
Always try not to not see the child.

2344
03:54:05,000 --> 03:54:07,000
Vognal pattern.

2345
03:54:07,000 --> 03:54:10,000
Alright.

2346
03:54:10,000 --> 03:54:13,000
Sad square.

2347
03:54:16,000 --> 03:54:19,000
I can now do that puzzle.

2348
03:54:23,000 --> 03:54:25,000
Vognal pattern.

2349
03:54:32,000 --> 03:54:35,000
Beam me back.

2350
03:54:35,000 --> 03:54:38,000
Let's do it.

2351
03:54:41,000 --> 03:54:45,000
Let's finish this up, huh?

2352
03:54:46,000 --> 03:54:48,000
Alright.

2353
03:54:51,000 --> 03:54:54,000
Servitude goes here.

2354
03:54:54,000 --> 03:54:57,000
Servitude was the circle with the X.

2355
03:55:05,000 --> 03:55:08,000
Where is it?

2356
03:55:08,000 --> 03:55:10,000
Is that it now?

2357
03:55:10,000 --> 03:55:12,000
Which one was servitude?

2358
03:55:16,000 --> 03:55:19,000
Where is the one with the circles, right?

2359
03:55:21,000 --> 03:55:23,000
Was it that one I was just on?

2360
03:55:23,000 --> 03:55:24,000
Because that one...

2361
03:55:24,000 --> 03:55:26,000
That's family.

2362
03:55:27,000 --> 03:55:30,000
That's honor.

2363
03:55:30,000 --> 03:55:32,000
That's hope.

2364
03:55:32,000 --> 03:55:35,000
This one was servitude, right?

2365
03:55:38,000 --> 03:55:40,000
I've wrote it down with like...

2366
03:55:40,000 --> 03:55:42,000
I've wrote it down like crazy.

2367
03:55:46,000 --> 03:55:49,000
I'm going to add which one doesn't match up with that one is hope.

2368
03:55:49,000 --> 03:55:52,000
So that goes over here.

2369
03:55:52,000 --> 03:55:55,000
Over there.

2370
03:55:55,000 --> 03:55:59,000
Over there is family.

2371
03:55:59,000 --> 03:56:03,000
Family goes.

2372
03:56:03,000 --> 03:56:06,000
There.

2373
03:56:06,000 --> 03:56:10,000
Family goes.

2374
03:56:10,000 --> 03:56:14,000
There.

2375
03:56:15,000 --> 03:56:18,000
No, wait.

2376
03:56:18,000 --> 03:56:21,000
Yeah, the honor goes there.

2377
03:56:25,000 --> 03:56:28,000
Alright, my servitude is like...

2378
03:56:28,000 --> 03:56:32,000
I don't even know which one it is.

2379
03:56:32,000 --> 03:56:34,000
Is it this one?

2380
03:56:34,000 --> 03:56:37,000
Yeah.

2381
03:56:38,000 --> 03:56:41,000
And then we go back into this room.

2382
03:56:41,000 --> 03:56:44,000
We pull the thing down so it gets down here so we get the power away.

2383
03:56:44,000 --> 03:56:47,000
Where the fuck is Big Big?

2384
03:56:47,000 --> 03:56:48,000
Okay, thank God.

2385
03:56:48,000 --> 03:56:49,000
I don't even need him.

2386
03:56:49,000 --> 03:56:52,000
Or do I?

2387
03:57:02,000 --> 03:57:05,000
Alrighty.

2388
03:57:05,000 --> 03:57:08,000
Whoa.

2389
03:57:12,000 --> 03:57:21,000
That's alright.

2390
03:57:21,000 --> 03:57:25,000
Press the button.

2391
03:57:25,000 --> 03:57:30,000
Oh, this is the...

2392
03:57:30,000 --> 03:57:34,000
I wrote this down a long time ago.

2393
03:57:35,000 --> 03:57:38,000
This is a short...

2394
03:57:38,000 --> 03:57:41,000
It's the shortest one.

2395
03:57:41,000 --> 03:57:44,000
This one needs to be short.

2396
03:57:45,000 --> 03:57:49,000
Oh, no, I gotta go look at it again.

2397
03:57:49,000 --> 03:57:54,000
It's like a weird accordion.

2398
03:58:15,000 --> 03:58:21,000
That's not it.

2399
03:58:21,000 --> 03:58:27,000
I didn't write this down good enough.

2400
03:58:27,000 --> 03:58:32,000
Mine is just like teeth.

2401
03:58:32,000 --> 03:58:37,000
Is it the other way or the other way or the other way?

2402
03:58:37,000 --> 03:58:44,000
I'm gonna do it one this way.

2403
03:58:44,000 --> 03:59:01,000
Um, let's see how big they are.

2404
03:59:01,000 --> 03:59:06,000
The stockets are deeper though.

2405
03:59:06,000 --> 03:59:08,000
I think I can still look at it.

2406
03:59:08,000 --> 03:59:10,000
I'm pretty sure I can still look at it.

2407
03:59:10,000 --> 03:59:11,000
Isn't it down?

2408
03:59:11,000 --> 03:59:12,000
Isn't it here, right?

2409
03:59:12,000 --> 03:59:17,000
It was a Super Mario ship, I remember, but...

2410
03:59:17,000 --> 03:59:23,000
Is there a way I can still see it?

2411
03:59:23,000 --> 03:59:33,000
Isn't the room...

2412
03:59:33,000 --> 03:59:40,000
Is there a light bulb?

2413
03:59:40,000 --> 03:59:43,000
There it is, okay.

2414
03:59:43,000 --> 03:59:47,000
The fat one goes at the end.

2415
03:59:47,000 --> 03:59:50,000
And then it's just a nice straight line.

2416
03:59:50,000 --> 03:59:55,000
Fat one goes at the end.

2417
03:59:55,000 --> 03:59:58,000
At least I know that.

2418
03:59:58,000 --> 04:00:05,000
Fat one at the end.

2419
04:00:28,000 --> 04:00:33,000
Let's get them in there and take a look.

2420
04:00:33,000 --> 04:00:39,000
Which one is the smallest one?

2421
04:00:39,000 --> 04:00:48,000
This one, right?

2422
04:00:48,000 --> 04:00:55,000
The one that's in here, the littlest, I think it's that.

2423
04:00:55,000 --> 04:01:05,000
Not quite.

2424
04:01:05,000 --> 04:01:13,000
Oh, that's in there deep, huh?

2425
04:01:13,000 --> 04:01:16,000
You stay there.

2426
04:01:16,000 --> 04:01:18,000
That's not small enough.

2427
04:01:18,000 --> 04:01:21,000
That's too small.

2428
04:01:21,000 --> 04:01:22,000
That's too small.

2429
04:01:22,000 --> 04:01:25,000
That's not it either.

2430
04:01:25,000 --> 04:01:27,000
I guess it was that one.

2431
04:01:27,000 --> 04:01:42,000
I guess.

2432
04:01:42,000 --> 04:01:43,000
Huh.

2433
04:01:43,000 --> 04:01:45,000
Interesting.

2434
04:01:52,000 --> 04:01:59,000
Okay, hold on, hold on.

2435
04:01:59,000 --> 04:02:04,000
Hmm, why?

2436
04:02:04,000 --> 04:02:09,000
This one has to be the smallest one.

2437
04:02:09,000 --> 04:02:11,000
Let's see that that one or that one.

2438
04:02:11,000 --> 04:02:15,000
That has to be one of these two.

2439
04:02:15,000 --> 04:02:20,000
Which one is smaller to those?

2440
04:02:20,000 --> 04:02:22,000
I can't tell if those are exactly the same.

2441
04:02:22,000 --> 04:02:27,000
I'm going to line this up.

2442
04:02:27,000 --> 04:02:49,000
That one looks like a little bit lower.

2443
04:02:49,000 --> 04:03:04,000
Am I, is it flipped? Did I flip it?

2444
04:03:04,000 --> 04:03:06,000
Oh, shit.

2445
04:03:06,000 --> 04:03:07,000
Whoa, okay.

2446
04:03:07,000 --> 04:03:08,000
All right.

2447
04:03:08,000 --> 04:03:15,000
Well, that's a thing that exists.

2448
04:03:15,000 --> 04:03:17,000
Now to get this right.

2449
04:03:17,000 --> 04:03:31,000
Oh, boy, let's just through a bunch of...

2450
04:03:31,000 --> 04:03:41,000
Oh, boy, this is going to be annoying.

2451
04:03:41,000 --> 04:03:44,000
That one's... whatever one is the lowest here.

2452
04:03:44,000 --> 04:03:45,000
So it looks like it's there.

2453
04:03:45,000 --> 04:03:50,000
There, there, there, and there.

2454
04:03:50,000 --> 04:03:57,000
Tommy Knot, you have saved my daughter with your acts of servitude and honor.

2455
04:03:57,000 --> 04:04:03,000
P has given you her plutonium crystals, which will provide your planet with power for eternity.

2456
04:04:03,000 --> 04:04:04,000
Thank you.

2457
04:04:04,000 --> 04:04:07,000
Because you have shown yourself to be a true hero.

2458
04:04:07,000 --> 04:04:11,000
I can now give you what you need to complete your journey.

2459
04:04:11,000 --> 04:04:13,000
Away home.

2460
04:04:13,000 --> 04:04:21,000
Activate tower transformation.

2461
04:04:21,000 --> 04:04:33,000
Tower transformation, power progress.

2462
04:04:33,000 --> 04:04:36,000
Tower transformation, complete.

2463
04:04:36,000 --> 04:04:39,000
Giant robot mobilized and ready for takeoff.

2464
04:04:39,000 --> 04:04:41,000
Give me the count of words, count of me birds are there.

2465
04:04:41,000 --> 04:04:45,000
Thank you.

2466
04:04:45,000 --> 04:04:49,000
Oh, Tommy Knot, do you think you're a hero?

2467
04:04:49,000 --> 04:04:54,000
Just wait, I bless you and then baby back to fiber's hand.

2468
04:04:54,000 --> 04:04:57,000
What the...

2469
04:04:57,000 --> 04:05:04,000
Oh.

2470
04:05:04,000 --> 04:05:11,000
Get destroyed.

2471
04:05:11,000 --> 04:05:16,000
Down vote, down.

2472
04:05:16,000 --> 04:05:22,000
Beaky.

2473
04:05:22,000 --> 04:05:27,000
No, the dog.

2474
04:05:27,000 --> 04:05:30,000
Hey Tommy.

2475
04:05:30,000 --> 04:05:32,000
I feel kind of funny.

2476
04:05:32,000 --> 04:05:35,000
Beaky, you're alive.

2477
04:05:35,000 --> 04:05:40,000
If by alive you mean hungry, then yeah, sure, I'm alive.

2478
04:05:40,000 --> 04:05:41,000
Come on little buddy.

2479
04:05:41,000 --> 04:05:43,000
We're heading home.

2480
04:05:43,000 --> 04:05:49,000
Maybe, maybe, stepping into something outside Garshan's arm.

2481
04:05:49,000 --> 04:05:51,000
Made it.

2482
04:05:51,000 --> 04:05:52,000
What do you know?

2483
04:05:52,000 --> 04:05:53,000
It's numb not.

2484
04:05:53,000 --> 04:05:55,000
Made it.

2485
04:05:55,000 --> 04:05:59,000
Beaky, change coordinates to Darshan's orb.

2486
04:05:59,000 --> 04:06:02,000
Aye aye, captain.

2487
04:06:02,000 --> 04:06:04,000
I always wanted to say that.

2488
04:06:04,000 --> 04:06:07,000
Look at that like big practical effect.

2489
04:06:19,000 --> 04:06:29,000
Did I win?

2490
04:06:29,000 --> 04:06:37,000
Darshan's orb.

2491
04:06:37,000 --> 04:06:45,000
Yeah!

2492
04:06:45,000 --> 04:06:47,000
Oh, that's not it.

2493
04:06:47,000 --> 04:06:55,000
Don't forget about the secret at the end.

2494
04:06:55,000 --> 04:07:05,000
I'm hearing like two songs at the same time here.

2495
04:07:05,000 --> 04:07:06,000
There are options.

2496
04:07:06,000 --> 04:07:08,000
Save the game.

2497
04:07:08,000 --> 04:07:12,000
All right, well.

2498
04:07:12,000 --> 04:07:16,000
I'm just going to send all the music out.

2499
04:07:16,000 --> 04:07:22,000
The sad music and like the title theme of the plan at the same time.

2500
04:07:22,000 --> 04:07:29,000
Yeah.

2501
04:07:29,000 --> 04:07:41,000
Okay, let me go back to the hold on a second.

2502
04:07:41,000 --> 04:07:45,000
All right.

2503
04:07:45,000 --> 04:07:48,000
Well.

2504
04:07:48,000 --> 04:07:51,000
So that was the game.

2505
04:07:51,000 --> 04:07:52,000
Pretty short.

2506
04:07:52,000 --> 04:07:55,000
It was about four hours or so.

2507
04:07:55,000 --> 04:08:02,000
To beat the game.

2508
04:08:02,000 --> 04:08:04,000
It was, uh, it was good.

2509
04:08:04,000 --> 04:08:05,000
That was fun.

2510
04:08:05,000 --> 04:08:06,000
That was interesting.

2511
04:08:06,000 --> 04:08:09,000
I enjoyed that four hours.

2512
04:08:09,000 --> 04:08:13,000
I wish it was a little longer.

2513
04:08:13,000 --> 04:08:16,000
Maybe like a part two kind of where you go to like a different planet or something.

2514
04:08:16,000 --> 04:08:23,000
But that was cool.

2515
04:08:23,000 --> 04:08:30,000
I don't know what I did here.

2516
04:08:30,000 --> 04:08:34,000
I just like scribbled on this.

2517
04:08:34,000 --> 04:08:41,000
Now these are my notes.

2518
04:08:41,000 --> 04:08:48,000
These will stay my notes forever.

2519
04:08:49,000 --> 04:08:55,000
Yeah, what, what did the ant, the theater Roosevelt ant, he didn't do anything.

2520
04:08:55,000 --> 04:09:05,000
I feel like there are some things that I missed.

2521
04:09:05,000 --> 04:09:06,000
Right.

2522
04:09:06,000 --> 04:09:13,000
Like I feel like there are a couple things that I didn't do that could have added some time.

2523
04:09:13,000 --> 04:09:31,000
Shit, that was, uh, that was Armacrog.

2524
04:09:31,000 --> 04:09:34,000
Time is it 10 30 four hours.

2525
04:09:34,000 --> 04:09:38,000
I really would have liked to have seen it be like six.

2526
04:09:38,000 --> 04:09:42,000
I thought I said, all right.

2527
04:09:42,000 --> 04:09:46,000
I mean like 10 would be like what that's what that's way up there because it's never

2528
04:09:46,000 --> 04:09:47,000
hood wasn't even that long.

2529
04:09:47,000 --> 04:09:51,000
The never hood was like maybe five or six, maybe total.

2530
04:09:51,000 --> 04:10:00,000
It might even be like the same and I just don't remember.

2531
04:10:00,000 --> 04:10:02,000
But I mean, they did what they could.

2532
04:10:02,000 --> 04:10:07,000
It was only a team of like three or four people I think that put almost 90% of that game together.

2533
04:10:07,000 --> 04:10:12,000
So it's pretty impressive because it was just a Kickstarter kind of game.

2534
04:10:12,000 --> 04:10:17,000
So that's off to the guys that could put all that animation work and all that design work together.

2535
04:10:17,000 --> 04:10:24,000
And a little under a year, I think, year and like some odd months.

2536
04:10:24,000 --> 04:10:29,000
And what I've liked to have seen it go on for like another hour or two, yes, absolutely.

2537
04:10:29,000 --> 04:10:34,000
But it was what it was and I thought it was fun.

2538
04:10:38,000 --> 04:10:46,000
So two hours if we try to explain the notebook.

2539
04:10:46,000 --> 04:10:47,000
Yeah, they did.

2540
04:10:47,000 --> 04:10:55,000
I'll give them. I'll give them a round of applause for their accomplishment because that was pretty damn cool.

2541
04:10:55,000 --> 04:11:00,000
Am I going to make any YouTube videos out of these streams?

2542
04:11:00,000 --> 04:11:03,000
Probably not.

2543
04:11:03,000 --> 04:11:15,000
Maybe I would make eventually like a playlist and upload highlights of or something.

2544
04:11:15,000 --> 04:11:20,000
Oh boy, I'm starving though.

2545
04:11:20,000 --> 04:11:25,000
And credit. There probably was something at the end. I probably should have watched the whole thing.

2546
04:11:25,000 --> 04:11:33,000
And that was an end of game. I think that it was just over just under I think a million dollars.

2547
04:11:33,000 --> 04:11:40,000
And for what the game actually was for all that work and all that shit that had to go into it.

2548
04:11:40,000 --> 04:11:46,000
Like 900,000 dollars is not a lot of money when you're making an entire game and claymation.

2549
04:11:46,000 --> 04:11:50,000
So that was cool.

2550
04:11:50,000 --> 04:11:56,000
I played Broken Age and Broken Age was just about like three hours long.

2551
04:11:56,000 --> 04:11:59,000
And that game took in like millions of dollars, didn't it?

2552
04:11:59,000 --> 04:12:04,000
And that game was like a 2D hand drawn game.

2553
04:12:04,000 --> 04:12:10,000
So all the guys at pencil test and like Doug ten April and you know, all the guys that worked on the game.

2554
04:12:10,000 --> 04:12:16,000
Very, very nice job. I much enjoyed that.

2555
04:12:20,000 --> 04:12:32,000
And with that, that's gonna wrap it up. I'm actually kind of glad I got the whole thing done on one stream.

2556
04:12:32,000 --> 04:12:35,000
That's kind of cool.

2557
04:12:35,000 --> 04:12:43,000
My name just like popped up at a nowhere that was crazy.

2558
04:12:43,000 --> 04:12:46,000
I'm actually surprised that that was just in there.

2559
04:12:46,000 --> 04:12:51,000
I know that because I because obviously I was a huge neverhood fan and a huge like earthworm gym fan.

2560
04:12:51,000 --> 04:12:58,000
So I gave enough money I think to be put somewhere in a game somewhere.

2561
04:12:58,000 --> 04:13:02,000
And that took me off card and that was funny.

2562
04:13:02,000 --> 04:13:05,000
But yeah, games are very expensive.

2563
04:13:05,000 --> 04:13:08,000
Very, very expensive.

2564
04:13:08,000 --> 04:13:15,000
Now if this if pencil test got like 10 million dollars or like 30, you know, 20, 30 million dollars from a studio.

2565
04:13:15,000 --> 04:13:19,000
Yeah, that probably would have been like an eight hour long game with a bunch more stuff going on.

2566
04:13:19,000 --> 04:13:23,000
But that was an independent game.

2567
04:13:23,000 --> 04:13:27,000
But yeah, I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna take off. I'm starving.

2568
04:13:27,000 --> 04:13:30,000
I was hungry when I started the stream. Even like two or three hours into the stream.

2569
04:13:30,000 --> 04:13:34,000
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like really, really, really hungry.

2570
04:13:34,000 --> 04:13:43,000
Let me just get to the right page here. I'm gonna see. I'm gonna tear out some of these pages.

2571
04:13:43,000 --> 04:13:47,000
Yeah.

2572
04:13:47,000 --> 04:13:54,000
You guys want to like see here's like one of the pages.

2573
04:13:54,000 --> 04:14:05,000
Actually, can we see if I can even turn on my webcam? Is it even connected?

2574
04:14:05,000 --> 04:14:09,000
Let's see.

2575
04:14:17,000 --> 04:14:19,000
Okay, did it work?

2576
04:14:19,000 --> 04:14:24,000
So here's the page. Here's a page you want to see. Can we over here?

2577
04:14:24,000 --> 04:14:29,000
Hey, I look at server to family hope.

2578
04:14:29,000 --> 04:14:34,000
I remember these symbols. We're gonna write those down.

2579
04:14:34,000 --> 04:14:41,000
There you go. This is one of my notebook pages.

2580
04:14:41,000 --> 04:14:51,000
It was before that anyway.

2581
04:14:51,000 --> 04:15:03,000
Yeah, there's all this stuff. That's funny.

2582
04:15:03,000 --> 04:15:10,000
All right, guys.

2583
04:15:10,000 --> 04:15:15,000
Well, that's just one idea was like five or four of the pages, but we don't need to see those.

2584
04:15:15,000 --> 04:15:20,000
We're gonna see my awful, awful handwriting.

2585
04:15:20,000 --> 04:15:27,000
But yeah, I'll talk to you guys later. Take care. Hope you enjoyed the stream.

2586
04:15:27,000 --> 04:15:32,000
I will be around probably the next couple days. I'm gonna put my stream something.

2587
04:15:32,000 --> 04:15:36,000
But yeah, I'm off. Take it easy, guys. Good night.

2588
04:15:36,000 --> 04:15:40,000
Thanks for sticking around the whole time. Thanks. Cool.

2589
04:15:40,000 --> 04:15:46,000

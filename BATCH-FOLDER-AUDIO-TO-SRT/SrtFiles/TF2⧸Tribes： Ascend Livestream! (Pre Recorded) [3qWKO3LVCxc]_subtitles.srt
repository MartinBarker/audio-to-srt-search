1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Do do do do do do do.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Do do do do.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh, I can hear myself.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Gotta change that.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I can hear myself.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's going on, guys.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How is your Saturday going?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Or potentially Sunday if you're from a different country?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, I got a.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll save that for a second here.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Hold on.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
OK, OK.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is a little smaller on the right.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, yeah.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So I'm trying something a little different.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And I am trying a.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I bought X-plit.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So I have X-plit here and I'm trying a few things.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm doing the capture source.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not doing the screen region.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So it's probably going to be a little different or at least on

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
your end, it'll look the same on my and it's going to be a little bit different.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
All right.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let me shot this out.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Twitter.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I already have a pre done.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Don't worry.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's all pre done.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Is that.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And close that window.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I got to do the YouTube one.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Over the hack that is.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There it is.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Tried.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Just hand.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Post.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
OK.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Close out that window.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And then I got this to do.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
All right.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We're in business.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We are in business.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
All right.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's get in here now.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So for those of you wondering.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm going to this is going to be uploaded to YouTube after this.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Probably what I'm going to start doing until YouTube gets its act together.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Because the last time I streamed on YouTube last couple times I streamed on YouTube, it wasn't pretty.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There's a lot of problems.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So maybe I'll try doing YouTube next week or something like that.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm not sure.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But this will be up on YouTube.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This whole thing.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
All right.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Refresh again because I didn't check that.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Where from Massachusetts am I from?

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I am from Boston.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I guess I'm not really from Boston.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm kind of from a suburb of Boston.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But I'm close enough where I can say I'm from Boston, I guess.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's get a zero out of.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Try 24.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Any zero out of 32.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There is a number of.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There is.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All right.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
How about this one?

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Here's the IP.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I know what Reading is.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have family members in Reading.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's pretty cool.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
All right.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The IP is going in the chat right now.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Make sure I get in there first.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
There you go.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What's going on guys?

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Bad water basin.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's fill this server up.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Come on.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's go.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't got all day.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh my kid and I got plenty of time.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I get all the time in the world.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's not really that true.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Zero out of zero.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Where is everybody?

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm the only one who's in the world.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm the only person who's in the world.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm the only person who's in the world.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm the only person who's in the world.

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm the only person who's in the world.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Did I give the right server?

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think I did, didn't I?

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I hope I did.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I hope I gave the right server.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Make sure I did.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This is the one, right?

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Just in case.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Just in case.

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
All right.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It looks like that was the right server.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Here's the hopes up.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I like you on fire.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay, I like you.

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I like you.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Nimbee you get a cool hat.

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
First time in my stream because you had six hours ahead.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It is late for you.

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You are late dweller.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, that guy's lagging.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't want to kill him.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That guy was like slow motion.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm going to kill him.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm going to kill him.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Got my lemonade over here on the left.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It has been really nice out.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't know what it's been like for you guys,

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
wherever you live.

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But my goodness, it has been so beautiful out here lately.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's been 75 degrees, 80 degrees, every single day.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And I've been going outside a lot.

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I've been taking my new dog from walks.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, that's a, that's why.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, nice shot, dude.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Nice shooting text.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Funny spots.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
All right, let me go out here.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yo, boy.

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Ooh, good dodging.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Jump into it.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Damn.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How long do you stream and go?

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I just started.

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I literally just started like five minutes ago.

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, boy, that's dead.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, come on.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Pyro versus Pyro.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, I didn't kill him.

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, I thought he was going to go to the, ah.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm going to die.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He kills that much health I have.

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh, run away.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Dead.

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Aqua fire, 102.

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What's up, dude?

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No demo, man.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll change this stuff.

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, by the way, if anybody has noticed,

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm not sure if you've noticed.

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh, God, that's great again.

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But I changed my FOV.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I made it bigger.

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll show you what I did.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I didn't make it too huge, but here's my FOV now.

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I changed it to like, 30% more.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And I made my weapon view model like 30% more.

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So if you've noticed that, I know a lot of people are saying,

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
please change that.

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I did.

163
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And it actually is a little bit better.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Easier to see things.

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Got a healer now, all right.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay, he's got a fucking gun.

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Oh, I didn't kill him.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He walks right over it too.

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What did he come from?

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What did he even come from?

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Was he the medic?

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Was he healing me?

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Like, the medic behind me was healing me.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He just came out of legit nowhere.

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Dear NG, I staff your sentries.

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
See you again soon.

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Wall of Spy.

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Spray over.

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's a nice spray.

180
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's how he gets in here.

181
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He's the light still alive.

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Don't let him get me.

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't let him get me.

184
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
He's got nowhere to go now.

185
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
How did he get that?

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He's going to get me.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He's doing a side stab.

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm not going to move.

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There we go.

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Dear NG, I staffed your sentry.

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh, I'm moving that.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's me.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We're going to get rolled right now.

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, my god.

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I haven't done anything.

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, you're making me waste my stuff scout.

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh, come on.

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't know how to hit him.

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's what's going on out here.

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He's not dead.

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He's not dead.

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He is definitely still alive.

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Let's go for a super spam shot here, dude.

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Come on, walk over that.

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, my god.

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Chaos.

207
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What am I?

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What am I?

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What am I?

210
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Let me get the medic at least.

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I didn't kill that medic.

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I would have been so upset with myself.

213
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, cancel.

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Do I like Twitch or do I like YouTube better?

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I mean, YouTube has a lot of problems right now.

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There's a lot of glitches with YouTube.

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There's a lot of bugs and stuff.

218
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And it's in beta.

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I can understand that.

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But it's, um,

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Twitch.

222
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's what I will just say at least.

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The YouTube stream is better quality though, because I'm partnered on YouTube and I'm partnered through

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Mishinema, so the YouTube stream will look better.

225
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But, I don't know.

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Hopefully they fix up some of their bugs.

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm confident they will.

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, scout.

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Whoa.

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Let's really walk through there.

231
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Medic!

232
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, I'll go combat in Junex.

233
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Absolute.

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Look at all these people.

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Like goodness.

236
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't you stuff killed.

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, man.

238
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, come on, kill somebody.

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh, my god.

240
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Come on now.

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, I got the medic.

242
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Good.

243
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Oh, keep coming.

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, no.

245
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Come on, give me the help.

246
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What?

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oomer!

248
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Escape.

249
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Damn.

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Thought I was gonna escape, but I didn't.

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Boom.

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah, after this round, I'm gonna go combat, Angie.

253
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, there's a crit dude right there.

254
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh, no, give me a way.

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Where's the spy?

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He's up top there.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He's going up this way.

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Get off.

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Why am I stuck in the staircase?

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Is that another spy?

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I love how it's just like everyone's running frantically around chasing this spy.

262
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, walk over that, please.

263
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Somebody go to the left side.

264
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Come on.

265
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
There you go.

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I double-dogged there.

267
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Anybody up there?

268
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll leave that there.

269
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That can be the defense.

270
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Spam.

271
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, god.

272
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Can we run the car?

273
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Get away from me.

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah, come on.

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Get on the car now.

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Come step on that car.

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You know you want to.

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Ah, come on.

279
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Get him.

280
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Somebody get on that car.

281
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I want to blow it up.

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I need to get healed.

283
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Wait, is there a spy up there?

284
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's spawn, isn't there?

285
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm going to deal with that.

286
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Hold on.

287
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'll just launch myself into nowhere.

288
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What is going on?

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Why?

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Why are they bouncing?

291
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, well, because...

292
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Where's this spy?

293
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He's freaking me out.

294
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Is that a sniper?

295
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No.

296
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yikes.

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The IP, I linked it a while ago.

298
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm going to be changing servers after this anyways.

299
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And get more people into the game.

300
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There's a lot of people in this room.

301
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh, this is definitely a lot of people still in here.

302
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh, crits.

303
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, I didn't get anybody.

304
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, damn.

305
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, I'm going to move behind.

306
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Soldier, hold on.

307
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh!

308
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That's a spy.

309
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's definitely a spy.

310
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No way.

311
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Maybe not.

312
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No, it's not a spy.

313
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Wow.

314
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, my god.

315
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I was not ready for this, but I'm going to do it anyways.

316
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Let's do it.

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Come on, have a little bit of something over here.

318
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I can blow people up.

319
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Come on.

320
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Oh, die you bastard.

321
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Ha.

322
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Ha.

323
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Derma is a wizard.

324
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Official.

325
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Ha.

326
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Let's go.

327
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Woohoo.

328
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, man.

329
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Look at all those people.

330
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
How am I doing?

331
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm not that bad.

332
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah, no, no 720 here.

333
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I am not part of it on Twitch.

334
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's over.

335
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I owe gaming.

336
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Register today.

337
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, I killed myself.

338
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Damn.

339
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Ha.

340
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I want to start live streaming soon.

341
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Any advice on how to get started?

342
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, yeah.

343
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Most important thing is your internet needs to be able to handle it.

344
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That's, I'd say, the number one thing is go to speedtest.net

345
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and run a speed test.

346
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And I'd say if your upload speed is less than one, like 1.0,

347
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
one megabit per second up,

348
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'd say it might be difficult for you to stream in good quality.

349
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But if you're higher than one,

350
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
or two megs up,

351
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
you should be fine to stream.

352
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But I mean, you guys have been here before

353
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
when I've had problem streaming.

354
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I mean, I have 10 up connection.

355
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And, oh my god.

356
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh my god, somebody run over that.

357
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Here we go.

358
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

359
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That's what I wanted to run.

360
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But you guys have been to streams before

361
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
where it's been unwatchable from lag

362
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and in the past,

363
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I've been here for a while.

364
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Unwatchable from lag.

365
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And I have a 10 up connection.

366
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's just weird.

367
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The internet is a weird place.

368
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And also, I'd also say you need a pretty good processor and video card

369
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
because essentially your computer's doing kind of like double work.

370
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh.

371
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
No, I got crit rocket.

372
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh, I got two cats, man. I love cats.

373
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I love any animal.

374
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The only animal that I could probably say I don't like

375
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
is, I don't know, maybe like,

376
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
oh, this is a hard question.

377
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The only animal that I don't think I would like to,

378
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
oh my god, another Uber, this is ridiculous.

379
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I like the Uber machine tonight.

380
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

381
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh, my god.

382
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh, it's crazy.

383
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Anyways, probably an animal big enough that will like,

384
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
literally kill me if I go near it.

385
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So, probably something like that.

386
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh, yeah, 4 up is fine.

387
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You'll be fine with 4 up.

388
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Here we go.

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh, boy.

390
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
God, I feel like the other team is getting neglected.

391
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Spread the Uber's around.

392
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't need them all.

393
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No, I'm just kidding.

394
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
We're going up top here.

395
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Or I can just apparently not detonate the mine.

396
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What's going on here?

397
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What's going on here?

398
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So many people.

399
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So many people to spam.

400
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
This is chaos.

401
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh, this is absolute chaos.

402
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh, my god.

403
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
This is ridiculous.

404
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There are two player servers in sanity.

405
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yeah, this, oh my god.

406
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
This is a full group in here, man.

407
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah, right after this round ends, I'm going to hope that I'm hopping a new server.

408
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Oh, fly.

409
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, that's a double.

410
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That's a double.

411
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's going up here.

412
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Hey, hey you.

413
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh, you're real.

414
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I was going high five.

415
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh, you want high five?

416
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, sure, I'll high five.

417
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And then just explode myself.

418
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Wow, that was pretty unintelligent, dumpy.

419
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But yeah, that's what I do.

420
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
All right, new server.

421
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Server.

422
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Wait.

423
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh, you want to see my brain.

424
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
A lot of you guys already know this.

425
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Sometimes I just don't think it happens quite often actually.

426
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
All right, let's see.

427
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Let's see here.

428
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Hmm, I would say let's play a randomizer server.

429
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But for my streams, I like to get a lot of people into the games as many people as I possibly can that are watching.

430
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So I don't want to just, you know, because most of the randomizer and arena mod tech servers, they're always full.

431
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
They always have 23 out of 24.

432
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So I would be the only one that would be able to get in.

433
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So I like to have people from the stream get priority and come and play and stuff like that.

434
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Let's find another server.

435
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This one was 32.

436
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
All right, oh my god, there's so many loading.

437
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Looking for 32.

438
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Hi, tower. We're going to bunch of bots.

439
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And then...

440
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, I ever do a workout video.

441
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I've thrown it around.

442
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I was going to do it a long time ago.

443
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But it's just, I don't know if people would even watch it.

444
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
A very small group of people that would probably watch it.

445
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But I don't know if like how it would be received.

446
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I think a lot of people would be like, what the hell are you doing?

447
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Why are you like a Whiston Waits?

448
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
24 or 20? Me to 32.

449
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Okay.

450
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
No, here we go.

451
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Good old fashion Dustball.

452
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Here is the IP.

453
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Oh, everyone's always asking about Enlighten.

454
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The new Enlighten.

455
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm working on it right now.

456
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So there will be a new Enlighten in the next couple days.

457
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Working on it right now.

458
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah, I'll probably do another one of those videos where I give advice.

459
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And I'll probably do like maybe a one or two minute vlog type thing

460
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
or I show you some stuff.

461
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But I'm not sure I would do like a 20 minute workout video.

462
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Okay, then up, then down, then up, then left.

463
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I think that would just be odd.

464
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I mean, I think there would be very weird.

465
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Let's go blue.

466
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I was red last time.

467
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Let's go blue.

468
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Oh, boom.

469
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh, what do I want to use?

470
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Oh, the new PDA.

471
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
He might not.

472
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And up, and down, and left, and egg.

473
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And egg.

474
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Let me say this.

475
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Would you guys watch an egg workout video?

476
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Like if it was the egg.

477
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What do I want to even play with?

478
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Oh, I'll stay with this.

479
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'll stick with this.

480
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Why not?

481
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

482
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
This server is like...

483
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Is this server like weird?

484
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's like, I'm like lagging.

485
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Oh, I'm trying to...

486
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I tried to have an iPhone.

487
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh, wait, you can just hold your hand like that?

488
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh, yeah.

489
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I thought, baby.

490
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I don't know if it's like the server enough.

491
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Is everybody like all jumpy?

492
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
They are on my screen.

493
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Does anybody else see that?

494
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't want to...

495
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
We'll go for one or two rounds like this.

496
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Oh, high five.

497
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Here we go.

498
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Shloping.

499
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah, I mean...

500
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, god.

501
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Everyone's like jumping all over the place for me.

502
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh!

503
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Centred down.

504
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Hey, hey, hey.

505
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
What do you think you're doing?

506
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh, but I forgot I was going to answer that question.

507
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
The reason why I don't do auto reload is because...

508
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Is somebody in here?

509
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Like the ghost of the pyro just in that room with me.

510
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh, no.

511
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh, god.

512
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
What do I do?

513
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
All right, well, here we are.

514
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'll block you way out.

515
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You can't get out.

516
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You're a dead ringer.

517
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I got you blocked in.

518
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Hey.

519
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That is a tip right there.

520
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
If you shoot a dead ringer and you know he's a dead ringer,

521
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
just stand in the middle of the hallway.

522
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And he can't get by.

523
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
At least, at least sometimes.

524
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm not going to get out of here.

525
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm not going to get out of here.

526
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm not going to get out of here.

527
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm not going to get out of here.

528
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
At least sometimes.

529
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh, just bads are going up up here.

530
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I don't know why I decided to put her here.

531
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's a bad idea.

532
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh, yeah.

533
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Where is my mini-century?

534
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Why is it still alive?

535
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Oh, my God.

536
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm getting distracted.

537
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I get distracted.

538
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I have ADD, man.

539
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Wow, we already won.

540
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
My goodness.

541
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
FG Spidey, Betia, I can say your name.

542
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I bet you a dollar, I can say your name.

543
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
32-man Dust Bowl is chaos.

544
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm going to go Huntsman Schneipan.

545
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
If you want to throw me a duel, I'll absolutely do it.

546
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Ah!

547
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Oh, now I go, let me say, I go to Sion,

548
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I think that's what you say.

549
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Sion, I go, sir.

550
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
By the way, if you're watching this on YouTube,

551
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm responding to people in the chat.

552
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Don't just think I have weird disorder where I just say random words.

553
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Like I said that last time, too.

554
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh, come on.

555
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
This guy is going to get head shot right now.

556
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Right now, here we go.

557
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I don't think you understand.

558
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Here it comes.

559
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh, my God, he killed me.

560
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh, no, a different guy did.

561
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Eggs.

562
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Look at this egg.

563
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Man, this server is lagging for me.

564
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'll tell you right now, oh, look at this double spy collateral.

565
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Oh, no, run away.

566
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh, tack!

567
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Oh, I can't even aim at people.

568
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
My screen is like, to take a jellyfish.

569
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh, he got me.

570
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
He got me.

571
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Oh, whoa.

572
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Look at the server.

573
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I don't think the server was designed that, but it's been a people in it.

574
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You want to get covered in jirati?

575
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Is that what you're saying?

576
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Is that what you just said?

577
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You want to get smashed in your face?

578
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I got him.

579
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Fan of Kid Icarus, I never played it.

580
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Not even the original.

581
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And I'm an old bastard and I didn't even play the original.

582
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Oh, that would have been sick.

583
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I heard somebody.

584
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I love to kill somebody.

585
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Finally.

586
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I got my first kill ever.

587
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Whoa.

588
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Did you see where I shot?

589
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
If you're watching this on YouTube, please rewind that and look at where I shot.

590
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I shot like five feet over that guy's head.

591
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I still killed him.

592
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
No.

593
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Oh, god.

594
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Let's just, all right.

595
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Let's do it.

596
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Oh.

597
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Oh, there's no way I was going to get out of there.

598
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
A good affordable graphics card.

599
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
That's a good one.

600
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Hmm.

601
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'd say probably like the GTX 550 for the 560.

602
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I think those are both under 200 bucks.

603
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I think, under 100.

604
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I think the 550 is, I don't know, the 550 Ti, I think it's called.

605
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I don't even remember.

606
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Go.

607
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I missed him.

608
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, god.

609
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I think Ag should be a weapon.

610
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I don't know how well they work.

611
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Oh, it's simsass.

612
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You got the 550?

613
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
How much is the 550?

614
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And follow up, is it a good graphics card?

615
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
There we go.

616
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Did you hear it?

617
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Oh, my god.

618
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Hey, let's go on.

619
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Just hiding over here.

620
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Away from you.

621
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
No, no, please don't kill me, please.

622
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Did you buy the 550 or did you buy the 550?

623
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Or did it come with your computer?

624
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Really?

625
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm thinking.

626
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I didn't get him.

627
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh, crap.

628
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Okay, yeah.

629
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
So the 550 is only like 130 bucks.

630
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I'd say that's a good graphics card to be able to save a little bit of money.

631
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Because the 580 is,

632
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
geez, what, like $500?

633
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Something like that?

634
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I know it's up there.

635
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And they're already working on the 600, aren't they?

636
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The 600 series?

637
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Oh.

638
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Is that?

639
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Okay, you're real.

640
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You're the real deal.

641
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I got you.

642
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Oh, cover them all.

643
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
No.

644
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Get this one guy.

645
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Come on.

646
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
The 680 is out now.

647
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, dear Lord.

648
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
What is that?

649
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Like $900?

650
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You can only imagine.

651
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Woo!

652
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I don't think we're going to win this.

653
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Oh god, there's people over there too.

654
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
All right, I'm going this way.

655
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Is anybody up here?

656
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
We almost just got it.

657
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Oh, he's still alive.

658
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
He's still alive.

659
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Hey, turn already behind you.

660
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Oh my god.

661
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I guess like, crushed that guy.

662
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Geez.

663
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Oh, forget that.

664
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm going this way.

665
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Oh my god.

666
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Grrrr.

667
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That's my favorite movie?

668
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Hmm.

669
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I don't know.

670
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Probably Ghostbusters or Memento or The Dark Knight or one of the Muffet movies.

671
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Or there's a lot of movies I've watched.

672
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I'm not a big movie watcher though.

673
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm not even a big TV watcher either.

674
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Oh my god, I just missed his head.

675
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Oh, this guy could be toast.

676
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Oh my god.

677
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Get away from me.

678
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh, this guy doesn't even know I'm here.

679
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Damn it.

680
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Fireclub is also a good one, Ari.

681
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Fireclub is a good one.

682
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm over the first time I watched Fireclub.

683
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I was so confused.

684
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I think I was like 16.

685
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm like 17.

686
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
When did that movie come up?

687
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I didn't fight club releasing.

688
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
When did it come up with theaters?

689
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Did somebody write the foot?

690
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
contenit.

691
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Oh my god.

692
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Hide.

693
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I don't see if like Grandpuck and Beatbox?

694
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I don't think you can.

695
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I would assume Grandpuck could not beatbox.

696
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
1999, okay.

697
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Oh.

698
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So that means I was.

699
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So 10 years ago was 2009.

700
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So 10, 11, 12.

701
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
So that was 13 years ago.

702
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I was.

703
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Hmm.

704
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So I'm 26.

705
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
16.

706
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
15, 14, 13.

707
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I definitely didn't watch it when I was 13.

708
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I don't think my parents would have let me do that.

709
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah, I mean once I watched it,

710
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
when I, I think the first time I watched it when I was like 15,

711
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
or 16, something like that.

712
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And I was confused.

713
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I was absolutely confused.

714
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Office space is a good movie too.

715
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The thing is I've seen a lot of movies,

716
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
but I don't watch a lot of movies.

717
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
If that makes any sense to anybody,

718
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
then oh my god.

719
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
That's accidentally got that guy.

720
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Greetings from Chi-Label.

721
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Greetings from East Coast USA, dude.

722
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'm going to go to the movies.

723
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm going to go to the movies.

724
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm going to go to the movies.

725
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm going to go to his movies.

726
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I don't have the money for anything to eat.

727
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm going to go to the movies.

728
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm going to go to my movies.

729
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm going to go to my movies.

730
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm going to go to chat with him.

731
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Well, what's the name of the movie?

732
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000

I'm not sure.

736
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Actually, I think we're in the same time zone.

737
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
We're close, in the same time zone.

738
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Oh my god.

744
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
after a kind of change servers after I die next just because the server is very

745
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
lacking look at this guy looks like he's a part of like a claymation look at

746

00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:05,000
TF2 is a huge part of my existence

801
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:19,000

803
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:40,000
oh can I get like a string or two or three in a row here

805
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
oh my liberty launcher is now a new rank

806
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:20,000
yeah I understand that phenomenal but to be honest the items that I have in my backpack right

807
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
now I mean I know I can understand like oh he's giving away his whole backpack he's gonna quit

808
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I understand that but I mean I have a lot of friends in team fortress and a lot of people

809
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:42,000
that oh god hold on oh god I'm totally ruined that much oh my god but I've got a lot of friends

810
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
in team fortress and I have a lot of people that have they support me with this channel

811
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
so any item that I ever want to use I can just get it back it might not be strange you might not

812
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
be genuine but that's I don't care I figured because like I said in the video I started with team

fortress too and I got all the support from you guys from team fortress a lot of you guys

814
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
are team fortress guys and that was a decent decent shot and that's why I West I felt like doing

815
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
it you know something I felt like doing and mine's made up there's no going back now so it's

816
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000

991
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000

it is an unbelievable game and it's free what what are the reasons do you need

997
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
to move this it's not in the way

998
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,000
to the left to the left to the right to the right I need to be moved a little bit

999
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
all right looks like it's centered at least on my screen

1000
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
all right so we're gonna get anybody in this call

1001
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
maybe might happen to the audio

1002
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
audio still here yeah it's here I can hear

1003
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,000
all right um somebody call me on Skype so we can start a call uh

1004
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
or stealth or burger boy whichever one of you guys wants to

1005
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,000
wants to do this thing and then just join up me home so they might have already been

1006
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:55,000
calling yeah they are what's up burger boy oh burger boy now burger boys call me get out of here

1007
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I'm inviting them this one is that his door huh I was first but about uh what about

1008
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
where's the talix maybe the talix play it was offline he might be doing a band thing

1009
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
oh hey what's up burger boy

1010
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:20,000
make sure you guys turn it off do all right if uh if somebody else wants to join can you

1011
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
guys monitor or self can you monitor just in case I'm like in the game

1012
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I'm just saying like I when I alt tab in a window it's just like

1013
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
like explodes so like I can't like really alt tab anymore

1014
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I mean you could play the game just every like 10 seconds just check this

1015
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
so if you want it's gonna be difficult to join the game off me right now because the way

1016
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
this game works is you have to have like if I don't know how many friends you can have to be

1017
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
honest I really don't know but I'm gonna go pathfinder

1018
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
turn this up the stream is under control I'm just standing yeah

1019
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,000
stream under control and I'm gonna turn this up turn this up because you can't hear

1020
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
all right I think we can go go go go sound on the stream should be

1021
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
hey burger boy the app drugs this one oh he's got it yeah

1022
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,000
he's absolutely got it so this game if you don't know what this is if you're like what the

1023
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:33,000
hell are you doing right now this game is pretty much think of team fortress meets quake

1024
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
meets skiing meets ski free meets windows 95 meets windows 98

1025
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I'm not sure if that made any sense but this game is just look at this is chaos

1026
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
pretty much think of this game as your you play as a soldier like a liberty launch of soldier

1027
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
and that's pretty much what everyone is using then you ski around like a hundred miles per hour

1028
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:59,000
it's all about momentum and we just really want the game yeah that's a good way to put it this

1029
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:08,000
game is halo with speed hacks and cooler mechanics in my opinion the music is cool

1030
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I agree with one gem of soda now it's changed it's changed you're gonna do map

1031
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:29,000
but it's it's not really halo it's like a it's it's cool in a little in my opinion just because

1032
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I never really played a lot so because you've never had an Xbox you've never could play on I

1033
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:46,000
had an Xbox at a 360 one um two or three years ago was the last time I had one oh what's

1034
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:53,000
going on why am I like stuck here I'm like stuck in this like lobby area there we go

1035
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
so it was lagging right this frame was lagging you kidding me

1036
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:10,000
you know let me know if it keeps happening guys try this again

1037
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,000
because if it keeps happening I might restart it just change a couple settings

1038
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
but yeah once you get like on a date this game is so satisfying I'm going bloody eagle by the way

1039
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:34,000
you can get some real satisfying kills within this game especially because it's all about a long

1040
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,000
range it's a long-range in people it's awesome oh did you quit and join a different game I did just

1041
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:48,000
join off me yeah it like kicks me out I'm sure I did

1042
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:59,000
oh it's so long too what because burger boy is like not a lot of play how do I not kill that guy

1043
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:14,000
here we go this is a beta this is a beta oh it's another kill it's free though it's open open beta

1044
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
oh it was in the air why didn't you probably reserve shoot or did that free crit

1045
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
good you get three shots pretty much when the pathfinder was like the scout you move around really fast

1046
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:36,000
and soldiers like the soldier I guess there's like nine classes in this game I'm pretty sure there is

1047
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:44,000
this is just team death match and essentially what why do we split the out I keep joining again we keep

1048
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:52,000
this winning I do not quit this one keep keep stay and stay in this one

1049
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:09,000
general general but you see this up here this 2700 xp pretty much if you don't want to buy the game

1050
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
the game doesn't cost any money but it's kind of like in team fortress where you

1051
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
do this economy where you can buy items if you don't want to wait and unlock them it's kind of

1052
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:24,000
like that so if you want to spend money you can but if you don't it takes a long time to get all the

1053
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:31,000
items and all the classes and everything so it looks like it's an exaggerated long time yeah

1054
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:39,000
like one of the hours of game time so like unlock a new class yeah and you start with three classes

1055
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:46,000
when you just get the game free you can spend 10 20 bucks and you'll unlock everything pretty much

1056
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:55,000
you know in term I'm gonna go blood eagle pathfinder again I'm gonna turn the graphics down a tiny bit

1057
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
just because I think people were saying it was lagging or you went on the other thing oh where

1058
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:09,000
are good boys oh I like switch teams in this game this is first of state yeah you're gonna escape

1059
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:17,000
minute switch teams oh this guy's toast down here this guy's toast guys oh get up

1060
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
to right shot finish this dude off

1061
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:37,000
there it is I so as you can see I got a shotgun you pretty much only have two weapons I have grenades

1062
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:47,000
too but I don't really use them I mean I know I should but and see the top the middle top 9792 this

1063
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
is team deathmatch and essentially how this works is when you die one point it's taken off your

1064
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:57,000
side of the team but if your team has the flag or if their team has the flag kills count as two

1065
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
so we have the flag right now so anytime we kill somebody on their team it's gonna count as two

1066
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
points taken down from their score oh I just got nailed

1067
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:15,000
so it's lagging huh oh let me see if the hell is on on here wasn't doing this on team fortress wasn't

1068
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,000
no it wasn't let's find out what the hell is going on it's too rough with landing string

1069
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:31,000

01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000

1117
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:51,000
you got like a top medal you didn't get a MVP actually you got two you got two medals

1118
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,000
you got two medals fly held and fly killer top accolades this thing is my most

1119
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,000
flag held medals is 41 and that's because I got the flag right when the game started and I skied

1120
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,000
around for 10 minutes and what did it why am I killing anybody either why am I not logged into my own

stream right now I just typed something how's that possible

1122
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:19,000
so it's oh playing team fortress too when I'm absolutely not

1123
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000

1127
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
as your best chance oh no

1128
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000

did burger boy nice

1216
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
I would not buy team fortress classic the only reason why I say that is because

1217
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:38,000
it's just it's very and now it's just so difficult to play this grenade's fam is

1218
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
it's it's unless it's like five dollars don't buy it we'll put it that way

1219
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
okay

1220
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,000
winner winner chicken dinner I think this is the first time I've ever gotten first place

1221
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:59,000
in anything in drives oh really that isn't achievement in and of itself for me

1222
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
not even first in the whole game this first in my team that's good enough all right quick

1223
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
flood the bloody go bloody everybody click look it

1224
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000

1229
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:44,000
step I'm gonna be the I'm gonna be the first step if I don't get Lord chaos I'm the first damn

1230
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:50,000
death wow that was the lucky skill I've ever had yeah I'll probably do videos for drives

1231
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
eventually everyone I got I got to get familiar with it get to go to edit

1232
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
but I'll probably do a few videos at least yeah

1233
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:07,000
okay this game is really awesome boom the other boom the other one I'm going to absolute wrong

1234
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:14,000

1236
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:31,000
and LC still was gonna die look at that chaos grenade into the chaos

1237
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:41,000
oh I thought I got that guy my game is just updating it's doing some really weird stuff

1238
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,000
hey when we when we installed it on burger boys computer is like all his fans turned on

1239
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:52,000
this computer almost like close load just random there will be surprised

1240
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:01,000
that is like awesome computer I have nice shot okay I got a really good shot but we've had issues

1241
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:08,000
that borderline stuff before we've had issues burger boy borderlands so like all right how many times

1242
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
have you heard bird and boy like swear and say horrible things in borderlands oh oh god

1243
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
basically he did read back his keys for his special ability and every time we wanted to pick

1244
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:25,000
up an item he decided to activate his special ability and playing his break he was just screaming

1245
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:34,000
constantly for the entire three hours that we played at our first time oh burger boy come on

1246
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
you can you can like do better than that

1247
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:41,000
oh let's go shoddy

1248
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I don't have any momentum I'm like walking around the man

1249
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:53,000
oh I still have you I'm gonna I'm gonna waste this grenade

1250
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
let's get this guy double team

1251
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I missed

1252
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
here we go another guy right there

1253
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
two guys seven seventy and that's a direct shot

1254
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:20,000
oh I got a phone lover oh you know wow that was a that was awesome

1255
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I mean a flag boy holy crap that was awesome yes I just tried to get a

1256
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
resupply and a guy threw a grenade right into my feet when I went over there and got me

1257
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
two shame I've rid of that was great

1258
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
down

1259
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
woo

1260
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:51,000
ah so general what classes do you have unlocked so far just the sniper central

1261
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:57,000
that's a nice thing about like yesterday we were talking about the like the ones that don't

1262
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:02,000
detonate on the impacts yeah they bounce around I have the grenade launcher right now

1263
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
and I've noticed that if you get a direct hit it's like the demo man you know we'll just explode

1264
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:11,000
let's just pop oh really immediately wow and the nice thing about them also is that they

1265
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:18,000
usually do a lot more damage and have a bigger radius than like the spin fusors yeah I've noticed

1266
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:24,000
the explosion huge you just get a massive damage spike right there I'm going to the lava I keep

1267
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:31,000
falling in lava like it is oh hey star wars I can't help

1268
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:39,000
does anybody else feel like they're playing like star wars I like feeling like that yeah

1269
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I mean even the noises like the I feel like the green dream it sounds like star wars

1270
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:54,000
oh thank you so what are you guys favorite losses with the games I like moving fast and having

1271
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:02,000
zero well fast find them yeah I'd probably say the fast find too just give the shock the shock on

1272
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:08,000
the cell that you break the trend break the trend I would say a raider or infiltrator see I don't

1273
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:14,000
even I got to get those guys I'm never again with the infiltrator yet never been good with

1274
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:23,000
stealthy classes in any game that's still fun yeah so you can you can cloak oh yeah you can

1275
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,000
cloak and it's like instead of using your energy per your jetpack it'll use it for your

1276
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:33,000
stealth oh okay that's a good trade off that's not like overpowering anything that's cool and there's

1277
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:39,000
a few items in my perks making up perks but I know it's at least one or two items that can like

1278
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:45,000
detect still people oh really I don't have any of those yet there's a lot of people here I'm so

1279
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:56,000
dead yeah there's like ten people around me skate down here oh Tony Hawk presents tribes as

1280
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Sam do a kick flip all right I'm gonna do like a shaky 200 oh that's like 25 points

1281
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:12,000
I gotta get some speed yeah I cannot catch up to the get flag carrier

1282
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:22,000
now I try and cut them off I'm very worried about how did you know it was him how did you know

1283
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:30,000
that hey car you're back I'm gonna like a stream I know germa's ringtone and I'm pretty sure

1284
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:35,000
bring boys you know I'm always gonna have a stun on him right now what if the talc sense is

1285
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:40,000
for them I didn't think he would I thought it was more of a burger more thing than I was

1286
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:50,000
on them do you mean that do me that oh yeah I got flag I were losing yeah I got the flag just

1287
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:58,000
protecting me oh I'm gonna lose speed right now I'm gonna be sitting duck in two seconds I'm

1288
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:06,000
gonna be your your body shield oh my god there's a whole crew just following you did I kill that guy

1289
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:14,000
oh finally geez oh yeah I got one up for you oh I'm dead I gotta kill though

1290
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:26,000
good man I got another kill I know I'm gonna land right on top of everybody that's right there

1291
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:35,000
oh no you mean that's like I ran right by it oh no oh that bastard got it

1292
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:47,000
oh no oh we get the shotgun up oh damn yeah I didn't pull out early enough I should have

1293
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:55,000
pulled it up way earlier oh it's Alex don't die I got him I got him man almost died I have 13

1294
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:08,000
health my streak I'm not saying you're destroying 16 kills man I think I just blew that guy's

1295
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
grenade up in mid air in front of him I think that's I think that's actually what just happened

1296
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:18,000
where is the flag I don't know we don't have it there it's pretty much tied it's a pretty close game

1297
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:23,000
right now I can't live this oh I just totally stole that from your burger boy

1298
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:31,000
melee is so tough but so satisfying when you get it I only do like on a head cave people

1299
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:37,000
are like snipers someone's last when you're an apple trader someone asks are they hats in this game

1300
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:44,000
they do I wouldn't don't put a past them man this this game could have a lot of items in the coming

1301
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:53,000
future all right you got the flag we're gonna lose we have absolutely

1302
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:03,000
gonna lose try and cut this flag guy off yeah we're gonna lose oh it's done deal cut them off not

1303
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:10,000
over yet guys no it's that guy's out of speed that guy's out of speed 7 to 24 I think it's over five

1304
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:21,000
oh yeah absolutely I lose somebody called in the nuke oh wait no I had 10,000 credit but I called

1305
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:26,000
in an inventory station instead mlsc has killed me 15 times in a row that's how he said

1306
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,000
why I feel like a retarget I suppose going over the strike but I called him the end of

1307
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
the choice it's all right there's nobody died give me that flag

1308
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:47,000
oh all right I think uh whoops probably one more round maybe you guys want to play ctf or just

1309
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:54,000
keep doing this um I don't see ctf can be very very long so I'll just do one more of this

01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:45,000
like on the ground nope nope you've got it you've got it oh my god oh you just saved my life right

1341
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:56,000
there what's my graphics card I use a GTX 470 in video it's good I wouldn't really recommend if

1342
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
you're gonna get a new graphics card don't get the 400 series because the 400 series at least the

1343
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:08,000
470 and the 480 they heat up way too much they are not recommended they're very they're good cards

1344
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:16,000
but they can get to be like 80 90 degrees Celsius and it's not really that good for your computer

1345
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:29,000
York I did I did play Globo agenda I have something like 700 hours I think clocked in on that game

1346
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:36,000
on global agenda yeah I've got I used to play both the insus used to play it like seriously

1347
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:43,000
global global global agenda is different I think global offensive no no global agenda I was

1348
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:49,000
before it was free like we we bought it and we played it and oh god like we put in hours into that

1349
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:54,000
game and then it all kind of went downhill after a while when they went free and they built tribes

1350
01:48:54,000 --> 01:49:01,000
ascent instead they took all their money out of global agenda put it into tribes instead so yeah

1351
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:06,000
yeah that's for and that's cool I what was global agenda was a like similar game third person

1352
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
shooter yeah it was that first then you could also get into first person when you aim

1353
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:16,000
down site and things like that it was it was a really good concept just it needed to be made by

1354
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:23,000
a bigger company if that makes sense yeah it does like APB I guess APB could have been

1355
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:31,000
out of some time or I don't know how to APB went into like the crap right didn't it because like

1356
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:36,000
they granted a money or something oh yeah they they weren't so much dead yeah it was just like oh

1357
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:42,000
free game we'll buy you just made it free for everybody just went downhill from then on in

1358
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,000
yeah there is no health kit by the way there's no health kits in this game

1359
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
oh

1360
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,000
oh shit so

1361
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000

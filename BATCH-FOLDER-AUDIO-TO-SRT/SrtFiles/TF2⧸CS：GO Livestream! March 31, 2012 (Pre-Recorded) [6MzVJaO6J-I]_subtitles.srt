6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Steam community body. 15 minutes. Yeah.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, dokey. Almost forgot Twitter. Let's get a server going so people can play while I finish this up.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
How about a couple of king of the hill badlands? All right. You guys ready to be happy?

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, one second. Nope. Not even on the thing for it. Hold on. Let me press play.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, I have to like give the IP to burger boy because he got really mad at me last time. I didn't give it to him.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So here we go. Ready? Nope. Oh, you're gonna get you're not gonna make it. I'm gonna

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
both face it. People probably reading it right now going in. Wait, did you already

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
paste it? No. I'm like wasted. It's just sitting on the screen right now. People will be able to

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
get it. There's already people in there. Oh, sorry. That was tweaking.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
All right. Ready? I'll be in five seconds. What were you doing? Were you like all like toilet?

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I was getting off. I'm about to hit this button. I'm about to hit the button. 63.146.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Call in 27025. You better hurry up. All right. I wasn't even ready.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What were you doing? But join the I'm joining off of you. Oh, you better hurry up, John.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, steamy day.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We're good. I'm in here. I gotta like I don't even put it on. Yeah, I told you to like go because I could like remember the number.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can remember that 12 digit number. No, HL2 dot EXE troll. What's gonna happen there? It's not real. It is real. It's always real.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now when it's loading the game. Have I seen the hung I've not seen the hunger games? Is it any good?

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And if the answer is yes, I will probably see it. It's about as good as the TV show community.

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's good as it gets. That was a good movie with Jack Nicholson. Oh, there's Berkaboy the insensitive one.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The insensitive one. Berkaboy the insensitive one.

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There he is. Because we all know that he's a real insensitive bastard. You've seen it five times.

27
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, it's gonna be bad. You didn't think different happened that fifth time? Ouch. Different, I think.

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh, there's a big Twitter. Where's my like hold on? I gotta like say it to my Twitter followers.

29
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No, hold on. Just tick.

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, yeah. I just take it. Oh, it's those of you wondering. I'll bring up my back back so you can look at it.

31
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, Berkaboy. The insensitive one.

32
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
There's this page one. So you can go over page one while I do Twitter and then I'll do page two in a second.

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I go backstabbed. Don't get backstabbed.

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Alrighty. All right, we go to page two. Page two. That's the page two.

35
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Even though you can't see. Oh, wait, show up. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry.

36
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So look at back to page one so you can see the colors. This whole thing's been given away.

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So hopefully you're one of the winners.

38
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, no, page two. I got a lot of strangers. A lot of strangers.

39
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Page three. That you hit your head. Yeah.

40
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Page four.

41
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I love how Berkaboy is using the vlogger now.

42
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hey, you're going to have to deal with it now, aren't you? No, I do know. He's on my arty.

43
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm like, medic in hand.

44
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
One more page after this.

45
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Does the needed one stick you to the wall?

46
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't think it does. It ain't only the.

47
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
My character was like standing up. I tried to kill him. And then page six.

48
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is probably like the best page with all my actual hats that I like love.

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And all the strangers are of course over here. You get the idea.

50
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's do it. Let's do a high five and let's get this wrong.

51
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, items that I cannot give away. I'm not. I won't be able to give away.

52
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So I can't give away the cheaters lament. I can't give away.

53
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think there's a couple other things you can't give either.

54
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
There's like two or three items. I know for sure I can't not give.

55
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Alvegim Julu. Let's turn it back.

56
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Just a tick. Just a tick.

57
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Where's my gerotti? I don't have the gerotti.

58
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, schmack. Oh dear, not again.

59
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.

60
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
On this corner here. Many century. Get out of here.

61
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, how did I not get him? Get him.

62
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You as buy you kind of act in like one.

63
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Look, MLC stealth just killed stealth.

64
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's fun. When do I think I'll hit 25,000?

65
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Probably a couple weeks maybe. Maybe a week. I don't know.

66
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's going to happen sooner rather than later. I probably will say that.

67
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know though.

68
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I have no idea.

69
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Follow me, Jack.

70
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Oh, you ran into it.

71
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I was pretty nice.

72
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't say so myself.

73
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I just got like fished. I got fish killed.

74
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm streaming this to the Boo Man 61 and MLC stealth.

75
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Boo and stealth. Hello. Hello.

76
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Those are your wonder.

77
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I was kicked by console. That's not cool.

78
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You got kicks? No, no, no, no, someone's saying they were kicked.

79
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What would you do? Nothing proper.

80
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's a bunch of B. It's changing level.

81
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It felt like you were talking to your dog.

82
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What did you do? What did you do, auto?

83
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm not.

84
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Nukuleus, huh? Nukuleus. Nukuleus.

85
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Direct it. I'll try it.

86
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm not.

87
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why am I using that?

88
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's CH.

89
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's like church.

90
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Do you know how to pronounce things?

91
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Sniper's I'm scared.

92
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, do you remember yesterday I was saying about how hard it is to headshot soldiers?

93
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm scared, Gemma.

94
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Boo, why are you no post-motto warfare 3?

95
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's what I said.

96
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I might not be totally dumb, but I'm weighing it up in my head.

97
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Some old recorded gameplay I just never used.

98
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I might make a few more of those out of it.

99
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is a fire roll.

100
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Direct hit.

101
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Watch out for the crits.

102
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, people everywhere.

103
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No, no soldier.

104
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm going to go.

105
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm going to go fire roll with this setup.

106
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Because I like it.

107
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hold on.

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hold on.

109
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Let's go.

110
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No, I missed it.

111
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I missed it.

112
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No.

113
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm going to turn the volume up a little bit.

114
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Can you guys hear the in-game volume?

115
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay, where's the 2 low?

116
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let me know.

117
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh no, I hit.

118
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We have to play.

119
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I got to start playing.

120
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh no, I missed.

121
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Get him off the point.

122
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh no, the only one on here.

123
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm screwed.

124
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We're going to get it.

125
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll hit or joke.

126
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Tell me a joke.

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Give me all you got with the jokes.

128
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I love jokes.

129
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No, I missed time badly.

130
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh, you son of a bitch.

131
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You rad bastard.

132
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Wait, it's probably tight.

133
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's probably tight.

134
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh no, I just missed.

135
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I can step my game up a little bit here.

136
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm going to get a bit of a dead.

137
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know why I could have survived that.

138
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't be fired right now.

139
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That was a lucky edge.

140
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm going demo.

141
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm going demo.

142
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What makes you a good demo man?

143
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
A lot of things.

144
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If you are good with shooting your pills.

145
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I can drink from a frying pan.

146
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What makes me a good demo man?

147
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh, he just lost.

148
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well, I will raise a demo.

149
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I want to be your discottenant with you now.

150
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What are you?

151
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No.

152
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We need more than one medic.

153
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You have two medic, sir.

154
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I had shot at one of them.

155
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I just walked right off the map.

156
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hey, there's a big hole in the middle of this map.

157
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm still.

158
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Your mom is so fat.

159
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Everyone at the movie did it.

160
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I can't really have burgdebois coming for me.

161
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Your mom is so fat at the movie did it.

162
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
She sat next to everyone.

163
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Sick.

164
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I got one for you.

165
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
She made me cookies and was a wicked nice woman.

166
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It was awesome to be around it all times.

167
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
There you go.

168
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, damn.

169
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
All right, I got one too.

170
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Why did the king and queen get a divorce?

171
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No. Why?

172
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Because they had a bad night.

173
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah, you suck.

174
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
All right, boo, you got to do one now.

175
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I've got to do a joke.

176
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's not working.

177
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You'll have to give me a few minutes, son.

178
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh, come on.

179
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You have to make it your own.

180
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
No, the press is on now.

181
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I've got a deliver.

182
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Hey, joke.

183
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh, my god.

184
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
No, I don't want that.

185
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
No.

186
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Get on the foot.

187
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I can't.

188
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I can't pick my head over there.

189
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm just trying to log stuff in the air.

190
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
No, no, no.

191
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So, boo, how about that joke?

192
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm just trying to get a little bit of a

193
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
little bit ofcotting of it, my element.

194
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Sniple was walking down the street one day.

195
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What was he singing to it, did he?

196
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Did he?

197
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah.

198
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So he was singing that song and all of a sudden a bus game

199
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and just smashed into him.

200
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, right.

201
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's the punchline.

202
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I mean, that was the first time I went through Germans

203
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and he made cycle, man.

204
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh, really?

205
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's just started.

206
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That was happens like much later than it should.

207
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, I sometimes said it to do that.

208
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Because when I usually, when I first put the announcement out,

209
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm just kind of sitting there doing nothing and shouting things out.

210
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So people probably just say, what the hell is he doing?

211
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So, 15 minutes in is pretty much when everything really gets going.

212
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I guess your stream get priority as well.

213
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Do, do, do, do.

214
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Let's do one more round in here.

215
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And then we're going to go to a different place.

216
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What do I play as?

217
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That's the question.

218
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'll go scout, I guess.

219
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Smack.

220
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What king?

221
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I literally just tried holding down shift to sprint.

222
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah, I've been doing that since I've been playing battle.

223
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh, look at how did jokes.

224
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I just realized that I saved your life just barely, I think.

225
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Who just, wait, okay, I'm so confused right now.

226
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I just saw stealth dying in front of me by MLC stealth.

227
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's a spy behind me, but I don't care.

228
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm too fast for him.

229
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Hey, who's the real one?

230
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Oh, my God, I can't hit the soldier.

231
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm so scared.

232
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Oh, my God, thank you for saving my life.

233
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Can I play Saxon Hill?

234
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We tried doing that a while ago.

235
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It didn't really work out so well though.

236
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Because we did prop hunt.

237
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, only because it's, I was the only person that could get into the server

238
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and we were just spending a whole lot of time just watching, spectating,

239
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and it was kind of boring.

240
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So, at least for a stream, it was kind of boring.

241
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'd want to do that for like a video, get a bunch of people in there

242
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and make some like fun video and I'm going to die.

243
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Get me out of here.

244
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There are ways of any people there to be fighting right now.

245
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, my God, they're all chasing me.

246
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh, come on.

247
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
See you guys, bye.

248
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Still alive.

249
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That other stealth guy is being as like 360.

250
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I have two health.

251
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Except for the sea and for me, might as well just do this.

252
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

253
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I got killed by a fish.

254
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I was you.

255
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, I thought it was priming sort of a bitch.

256
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I was in this fond door and he shot me right in the back.

257
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Like, I was like, I was right in the door and I got hit right in the back.

258
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, I'm on the red team.

259
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It was a revolver too.

260
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
He's not dead.

261
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
We got a lot of scouts.

262
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I just heard him.

263
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Was this soldier behind this bastard?

264
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I feel like Plano Piro.

265
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You've starting to like him more now.

266
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I was never good at Piro before.

267
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh, I'm scared.

268
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm going to go around the street.

269
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You know, I've learned to really like Plano.

270
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Plano Piro is like a ton of fun for me.

271
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And I never used to like him because I always wanted to use the flag.

272
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And when I found another pyro, it's impossible.

273
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Go, go, go, go.

274
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yeah, the flag on pretty much reinvented Piro for me.

275
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It became so much fun.

276
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What are my views on meet the pyro?

277
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I think it's going to be epic.

278
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Judging by the last two we've gotten meet the medic and meet the spy, they've been unbelievable.

279
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So one can only hope it's got to be something just as good if not better than meet the spy and meet the medic.

280
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What if it was like a 2D animation thing?

281
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah, that'd be interesting.

282
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It'd be interesting, it'd be cool.

283
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No, no, no, like it's like it sucks.

284
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And what if meet the pyro sucked?

285
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I would be disappointed. I shouldn't have shot him. Why don't you do that?

286
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
At least you got my back anyways.

287
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm getting destroyed.

288
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I just meet the pyro was like stick figure.

289
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And like the music was a midi file.

290
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Oh god.

291
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What if the pyro was a stick figure?

292
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Wow, you just blew my mind right there.

293
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What?

294
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You just totally blew it.

295
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Like he takes off his mask and it's literally just a stick figure.

296
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's like a broom, like a family guy.

297
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh no!

298
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
They're probably not going to take his mask off.

299
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I bet you hit the hill take his mask off.

300
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You're saying that?

301
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Well, him or her.

302
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The pyro will probably take off the mask right when the ending happens.

303
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Like oh, here I go, like here it.

304
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It'll probably be something like that.

305
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It'll be Gabe Newell's troll face.

306
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What if it was a new face?

307
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's just Gabe Newell's face.

308
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Like he made the character like after himself.

309
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I cannot hit the scout to save my life.

310
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah, then anybody can save my life.

311
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Oh, real?

312
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Jeez.

313
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh.

314
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I mean, all jokes aside the pyro is clearly going to be Zoe.

315
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Clearly, let's take the scout.

316
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And then if I'm going to go with the...

317
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm going to show it start.

318
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Do I have a stranger?

319
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't.

320
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
We'll go with the whole set.

321
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
How do you stop a Gabe band?

322
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Easy.

323
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You press the Gabe band.

324
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Gabe band, Gabe band.

325
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
In addition, I'll save you.

326
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh god.

327
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Help me.

328
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Oh, boo with the pistol.

329
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Nice.

330
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
If somebody can find an empty randomizer's face.

331
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
We need an empty randomizer server.

332
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Not a full one.

333
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Not one that's like an arena.

334
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
A real good instant respawn randomizer server with nobody in it.

335
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Then we can hop into it.

336
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm not dealing with that.

337
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
This guy is a ludicrous.

338
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
He's been destroying me all game.

339
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So that is a quest for the German group to find that randomizer server.

340
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
How many German points do they get for completing that quest?

341
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
15 German points.

342
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I know that's you.

343
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You got off to a spryme with you.

344
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Come on now.

345
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
He's going to headshot me.

346
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I know he is.

347
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He always does.

348
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
He always does.

349
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
He always does.

350
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
He always does.

351
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Can I vote Optimus Prime like Best Buy in the world?

352
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Best Buy in team fortress?

353
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Can I safely say that right now?

354
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I really think I can.

355
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
He's in part of that with electric bungalow.

356
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
He has an electric xsp.

357
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Oh my god.

358
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm not hitting anybody with this.

359
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Let's get in here and then do it.

360
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That was so lucky stuff.

361
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm going to die.

362
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Oh boy.

363
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
He has a brass piece.

364
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
What are you doing?

365
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Did I get it?

366
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I was so lucky.

367
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I was on it.

368
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm sorry.

369
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm sorry.

370
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Get on it.

371
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Somebody just sneeze on it.

372
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
No.

373
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I refuse to die.

374
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I refuse.

375
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Jump.

376
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That is a randomize server right there.

377
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
If that is the case.

378
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
That was so close.

379
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Let's go find out.

380
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I need to go to.

381
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Add a server.

382
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Let's see if this one has no people in it.

383
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
All right.

384
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
This is the server that we're going to do right now.

385
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Ready guys?

386
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
207.188.214.12.

387
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Call in 28016.

388
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Go.

389
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm trying to do it.

390
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm trying to do it.

391
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm trying to do it.

392
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Randomize is like heavies with spy knives.

393
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
This is total nonsense.

394
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's on nucleus too.

395
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Drop to the slot reservation.

396
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What?

397
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I need to.

398
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Slot reservation.

399
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Well.

400
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I should have got in there first before I sent it.

401
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Damn it.

402
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
What was the second one?

403
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I need to get in there first.

404
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Let's see if this one was existing.

405
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
We have to change.

406
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This is no way I'll get in there now.

407
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Let's try it again.

408
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
This one.

409
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm going to put a new IP into the chat.

410
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
When you get a chance, everybody go to this server.

411
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I'm going to tell you guys ready?

412
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
205.234.152.85.

413
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Call in 27015.

414
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Let me know when you're connecting.

415
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
There we go.

416
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That's the one we're playing on right now.

417
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm not going to get in there first.

418
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
There we go.

419
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Thank you.

420
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Or Zuse, whoever it is.

421
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Doesn't matter what you're doing.

422
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
This is the hardest thing.

423
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm holding the sniper.

424
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
What is God's name?

425
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
broken apart and I just I can't even actually have to see this I can't even

426
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:48,000
explain it. Oh I got the thick each other. Oh nice the golden wrench. Oh my god.

427
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
The the hand models sometimes they're fine sometimes they're just

428
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
totally broken because I'm a soldier and I have medic gloves with my syringe gun.

429
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Then I pull a weird looking winger and he has normal hands. Dude I'm holding this

430
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
wrench like a gun and it's like I'm not even touching it it's like floating in

431
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
my hands. Who has the century? This guy's spy with a degreaser.

432
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
He's floating around like a clown. That is an oxymoron right there. A spy with a

433
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
flamethrower. Oh yeah like the child was found missing. He's got to just stand there like hello.

434
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What the hell is this? Is this the force of nature? I can't I can't even do it. I can't

435
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:47,000
even talk. All right the force of nature the pistol and the Clyde and more.

436
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Crits. God I can't even play my headharts by looking at this. This is a

437
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:06,000
disgusting thing. Is that guy still standing there? I'm gonna see. What? I'm so confused.

438
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
This guy is just standing there. Oh look at this. It's like a sniper with a

439
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Liberty launcher, the chocolate and the the fan of war. All right Liberty

440
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
launcher sniper. This could be interesting. Can I zoom in? Every funny could.

441
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Hold on this guy has that guy just had the Natasha as a sniper and he was holding

442
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:42,000
it like a sniper rifle shooting it. Oh my gosh I'm using the overdose and if you

443
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
like reload and shoot at the same time you can just keep shooting forever. Oh yeah

444
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I get instantly loads it. All right. Oh wait no it doesn't actually like shoot. Look at

445
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
this like pump action like freak out gun on music. What else do I have? Oh the pistol

446
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
that's boring. And what? What the hell is this? What the hell is this? Why am I like a monster?

447
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:18,000
What? I wish you could have just seen that. I had huge like brown monster hands. It was the

448
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,000
engineer. Who are you playing? What are you doing? I'm a spy with the Oopulkabah. I was like

449
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Sasquatch right there. A Poco fist is that like a fake thing? What? Say wait the soldier

450
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
soldier spy. Turn on. But when I say soldier spy I mean like soldier with a knife

451
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:52,000
soldier spy. So they've added new crazy funny items huh? All right engineer with the

452
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
oh the Cretacola and the oh this is gonna be good. Oh that's awesome. I hope I can stay alive

453
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
because this is a great setup. Is it soldier with the Cretacola? Soldier with rocket launcher

454
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:13,000
oh my rocket launcher Cretacola. Like are you are you shooting me? Oh no come on. I didn't even get to use this.

455
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Are you come on? What? I didn't even get to use that awesome setup I just had. That pains me.

456
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Is there by not a doesn't I have like King of the Hill? This would be great for King of the Hill.

457
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I don't think so. All right Ubersah, Frontier Justice and Durant. This is fantastic. That has a Medigan

458
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:46,000
that's a pyro. I'm a medic Tommy Slav. It looks so like out of place. Oh okay I see. Did I kill him?

459
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I got. So the Oopulko fists are the regular fists but they give people when you crit them. I don't

460
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
think I was hurting anyone. I was shooting them and it wasn't doing damage. Like numbers weren't popping up

461
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
above their head. God this this like makes me so happy. Like this mode doesn't it just make you like so

462
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:13,000
hell? Look at this. This guy's like wearing the intelligence like Mary Poppins. Like what the hell are

463
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:22,000
you doing? He's bouncing it on his head. All right syringe gun and the wrench again. Can I

464
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
feel you can't build buildings I forgot? Well this is the blue saga. I'm dying right now. Are you

465
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
serious? No. I'm literally dying right now because I'm have blue it's gonna kill me.

466
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So the blue saga was literally killing. Oh that was ball.

467
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Okay I need Jerma. I need you to tell me what I have.

468
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
All right well I'm standing outside this boring door. I have no idea what says.

469
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
All right you have the direct hit, the crit's Creeg and

470
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Oh the crit's Creeg. Yeah you have the crit's Creeg.

471
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You should see what this looks like for my point of view. This is retarded.

472
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I just saw like two seconds. All right I got the fist. I don't even have a secondary.

473
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I can't I don't have a secondary. I think I like it's probably the razor back.

474
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So razor back fists of steel. Wait what's fish cake? It's like a riskin of the chocolate.

475
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Oh this is so good. Why does this look so perfect with the sniper?

476
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Oh come on we just got crits too. We got crits.

477
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I have a spy knife. Read the top of the screen.

478
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
What's the top of the screen? Oh god I am so stupid.

479
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Wow wow you are wow look at how stupid I am. It says what you have right there.

480
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Hi that was like right when you spawn it tells you where you have.

481
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Oh my god this is not let I'm using like a regular hydro set right now.

482
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I literally have the like a normal I have to

483
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
what are you doing?

484
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
What are I for a melee? It's golden wrench.

485
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm a dimmer man with the enforcer and the guns like broken apart and floating.

486
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Oh I got it I got a golden wrench somebody. I don't even know I'm trying to reflect

487
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Brock because I don't even know what he has.

488
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
The golden wrench.

489
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
This they turn to a gold statue don't they? Yeah they do.

490
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I've never seen that before.

491
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah everyone's like he's like he's a different class and I'll stand again the same spot.

492
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Oh this person's awesome.

493
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
What do they keep like capturing the flag so quickly? That's like for kill.

494
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Crits and I. Oh that's too funny.

495
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Come on I don't know I don't think I could play this mode a thousand times and I

496
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
probably left just as hard every single time.

497
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's just how this medic is holding this enforcer like like a like a gang member like sideways.

498
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I wanted I wanted to see just how I picked that up look at this.

499
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I go yeah look at this giant axe in my hand it's like a 180 pounds you want me to just hold

500
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
it with one hand. It's not even doing any weight animation.

501
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
There's no swing animation with that.

502
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
This is so hard.

503
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
My brain like cannot handle how this looks. It actually looks like kind of normal to be honest.

504
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I feel like that's the way like a shotgun would act in somebody's hands.

505
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Like that one. I'm gonna out of kills with this enforcer.

506
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Oh let me just one second guys let me spin up my like 200 pound axe in one hand.

507
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Let me go cool.

508
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm looking looking all useful this is gonna be.

509
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Come on I gotta kill him with it.

510
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Three.

511
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Good god now.

512
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Who keep?

513
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Well that was weird.

514
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
No swing animation.

515
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You can't tell I got it.

516
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
We have a tank of the animation.

517
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Burger boy the insensitive one.

518
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Burger boy you can't call a thematic man nobody has it.

519
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It could be like a heavy with the damn crits pretty good the metting gun.

520
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Engineer with the Natasha the winger and the atomizer.

521
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Can I double can I triple jump?

522
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I can double jump.

523
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I can double jump as the engineer.

524
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Well the atomizer.

525
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Yeah I have the atomizer with the ng.

526
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I can double jump and I can build building that's a spy.

527
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I get the cool setup and I die instantly.

528
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
This happens every single time.

529
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I turn the corner.

530
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
That was a spy so I was going invisible behind people in my force in nature.

531
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It's visible that's crazy.

532
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Turn my singer song that's somebody just uh um come on.

533
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Winger oh let me let me hold let me let me just

534
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
stupid it's like a little no words can describe that.

535
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I can't even make a joke it's too stupid.

536
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Oh god that's a dead that's a dying battle right there.

537
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I have to revolver.

538
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
My spy has three hands

539
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
because I'm holding killing gloves of boxing.

540
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I pull up my dandering.

541
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
This setup is terrible.

542
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Scout with a mini gun.

543
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Everyone run for your life.

544
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
T-go challenge me to a duel.

545
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah I wonder how mad Bergerboy is right now.

546
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I bet you Bergerboy is screaming at his computer screen.

547
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I healed for a hundred points as a sniper.

548
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Extinguish.

549
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Is wait if I'm holding this backwards?

550
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
All right look at how I'm holding this.

551
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I could really hurt myself with this thing.

552
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Fish cake.

553
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Oh it still works.

554
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
All right let me launch your fish cake and the backwards x thing with your.

555
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeah make sure don't drop it on your face.

556
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I have two shotguns.

557
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Scout are gonna family business.

558
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I have the syringe gun of the heavy.

559
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I don't like this.

560
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Watch it see even killed me.

561
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
What?

562
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That I am confused.

563
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
That was weird.

564
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Braaaaaad.

565
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.

566
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Oh that's my favorite dub sub song.

567
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,000
How'd you know?

568
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I was doing the heavy mini gun noise.

569
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Braaaaaad.

570
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d sabread.

571
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Charge and charge.

572
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Can I charge out of the sniper?

573
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I can't.

574
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Oh I can't charge.

575
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Damn it.

576
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,000
What?

577
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Okay so I'm I'm a spy and all I have is the tribal one.

578
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Ship.

579
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I don't have any other item.

580
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Can you cloak?

581
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah.

582
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I wish I could charge and charge right there.

583
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
That would have been hilarious.

584
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I just spawned and for some reason I spawned with like 350 health.

585
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Overhealed yeah.

586
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I think I think some of the people do.

587
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I think everyone does, to be honest.

588
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm spawning overhealed.

589
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I have a rocket jumper.

590
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I guess no.

591
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Maybe not everybody.

592
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Bootlegger, raise it back.

593
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Okay this is actually a pretty good setup.

594
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I-no I can't charge.

595
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Oh this sucks.

596
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Nevermind.

597
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Guys get up to the lane.

598
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
That's a way where they're set up ever.

599
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I gotta raise it back.

600
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I can't be back.

601
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I had Gerati rocket jumper and equalizer.

602
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I can't charge.

603
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
This sucks.

604
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
This is the worst thing.

605
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm a spy with a tribal man's ship and that is literally it.

606
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
If you should be a duel I'll deal you.

607
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I'll do anybody.

608
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Why not?

609
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Absolutely.

610
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Dead rig or heavy.

611
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
But for the next map let's go to bad water.

612
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Ah bad water sounds fun.

613
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Alright so I have-

614
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm a soldier with a big earner and the enforcer.

615
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Does it talk work?

616
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It's taunt.

617
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I can't do the taunt.

618
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Damn it.

619
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Taunt doesn't work with this thing.

620
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
What the hell?

621
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm better off just using this.

622
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Oh what's the Scottish resistance?

623
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I have no idea how this works.

624
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Okay.

625
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Look at that.

626
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
That's just pointing straight down into the ground.

627
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
That's so funny.

628
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Oh this thing's great for people jumping.

629
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I don't think I've ever seen the guy I'm doing one time.

630
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Oh my god.

631
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That guy just got so many people in that Natasha.

632
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Alright this will be the last round of the randomizer.

633
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Then we'll go to one more random server and

634
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
oh my god I'm a medic with the Natasha and the Fritzkrieg.

635
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
What I have for melee I didn't even read it.

636
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Oh the wrench.

637
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Oh you thought the medic was just going to be here?

638
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And didn't you?

639
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Oh my god this is so OP.

640
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Now I just switch over.

641
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Get some heels around.

642
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Let's scrub it around a little bit.

643
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I'm a spy running around with heavy fists.

644
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Spongebob.

645
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Oh I got you.

646
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I got you.

647
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I got you.

648
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
King DDD.

649
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Oh come on give me those crits.

650
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Come on come on where is somebody?

651
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
God this is so insane.

652
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Medic with a god damn mini god.

653
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Now you serious.

654
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And I'm healing people with the crits for you.

655
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
This is ridiculous.

656
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And I can upgrade and repair buildings.

657
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Wait what's the big kill?

658
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It's a risk in the revolver.

659
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So I have a revolver and I have a pistol.

660
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I don't even know what he has.

661
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,000
What does he have?

662
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Let's get the Scottish resistance.

663
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Somebody do something.

664
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Well what in the last like two seconds?

665
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I had the thing called a jar of ants.

666
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Is that just I thought it was dry.

667
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
We want to throw it at people.

668
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
They would like taken damage.

669
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I've never seen that before.

670
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Yeah that's weird.

671
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I get I just healed a thousand points of the pyro.

672
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I was I don't think it was even a pyro that was weird.

673
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So because I'm a spy I have a wrench

674
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
and I can either disguise

675
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
but I can't build anything.

676
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
All right shotgun short circuit.

677
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
What what is going on?

678
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm so confused.

679
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Is this how he's holding the shotgun?

680
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Hold on.

681
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
My so this is faster reserve.

682
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Oh I have a knife too.

683
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Okay I was holding the shotgun down like a midi gun.

684
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And it was like shaking.

685
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I couldn't even like tell where I was shooting.

686
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
All right so after this we're going to go to a normal.

687
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm getting the worst things ever.

688
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Yeah I got a great one last time.

689
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The medic.

690
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The medic setup.

691
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,000
All right so.

692
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Bonka.

693
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Oh this is going to be great.

694
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Bonka talking punch.

695
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Does it do anything?

696
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Am I am I am invincible right?

697
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah I am sick.

698
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm getting I'm getting all these pistols.

699
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
What what?

700
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I have a buffalo steak sandwich do you?

701
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Many crits and you take many crits but you can't use anything but melee.

702
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
That was where the no swing animation throws me off because I'm just like standing there.

703
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I'm like am I even swinging people?

704
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Oh it's tied up now.

705
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh wait a minute how does the widow maker even work?

706
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
How would the widow maker work?

707
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Am I just a fitted ammo?

708
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Well how is this going to work?

709
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I think I just haven't fitted ammo.

710
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Oh no I can't lose this.

711
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
No shit.

712
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Oh I really think I just had a fitted ammo with that thing.

713
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We're getting my spawn draft now.

714
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:38,000
The front view is just as hot 10 shots in it.

715
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Oh man.

716
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Oh yeah I still have metal like yeah I just can't see it.

717
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
That's still funny.

718
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
All right we're going to go one more of random just normal server to play.

719
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And then we're going to hop in a cs go.

720
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So let's do let's find another good server.

721
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Let's try and get a 32 person.

722
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Here we go.

723
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Oh one let's go back to her mind.

724
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
No no no no.

725
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Can go to dust bowl.

726
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
That's 30 that's got 32 right now.

727
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Yeah we're going to do it.

728
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
32 people can play in this zone.

729
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
This would be the last shabang.

730
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I got to give it to burger boy first.

731
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Hold on.

732
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Burger boy will like flip out if I don't.

733
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And then ready 96?

734
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000

27015.

738
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And join and that's the server guys.

739
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Good old dust ball.

740
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Good old fashioned dust ball.

741
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Oh it's not randomizers.

742
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
No this is just a regular.

743
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Okay.

744
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Oh yes dust ball my favorite.

745
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I like dust ball.

746
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
People don't like it but I like it.

747
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I like it after that brass beast game yesterday.

748
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So my buddy I'm from Providence.

749
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So cool dude.

750
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Good old Rhode Island.

751
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I got blue why not.

752
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Mission begins in 50.

753
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
In 50 seconds that's what I just said.

754
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Oh well King yeah I will absolutely do jailbreak.

755
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Oh I have but while there's people here I need I need to mention this.

756
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
There is going to be no stream next weekend

757
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
because I'm going to be a Paxies.

758
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Paxies last room.

759
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And I bring your computer with him.

760
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Bring everything down that would not that would not happen.

761
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I know.

762
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I know stream next week.

763
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I just want to be very clear.

764
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
But the good part is I'm going to get plenty of cool videos and packs

765
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
and it'll be plenty of cool stuff to see from that.

766
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Do not worry.

767
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
So what do you actually do at Pax?

768
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Because I know nothing about game conventions.

769
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Do you just play new games?

770
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Pretty much a good giant.

771
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It's just a convention where pretty much every developer you can think of

772
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
is going to have like an alpha build or a beta build of their game there.

773
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And you can kind of have like playable demos.

774
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
They have like trailism that you'd never before seen stuff.

775
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And it's just a great place to hang out.

776
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
There's like a bunch of like free play rooms.

777
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
They have like a hundred Xboxes, a hundred like PS3s.

778
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Like a hundred PCs all lined up.

779
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
You just go in and play with like people that are in the room.

780
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Oh cool.

781
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It's really interesting.

782
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It's definitely fun.

783
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It's also the games can you go and check out.

784
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Or are you looking forward to checking out?

785
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I don't know man.

786
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Nothing really.

787
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I'm trying to think if there's anything I in particular would like to portal to.

788
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Yeah, do portal to last year.

789
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I went last year.

790
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
The line for portal to

791
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
was like an hour and a half long to play the demo.

792
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And like to see like the trailer and stuff.

793
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It was like this enclosed off boxed off room.

794
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And you couldn't you couldn't get you.

795
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
You couldn't even see what was in there.

796
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It was like a closed off like box and like the line went into the box.

797
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So it was pretty nuts.

798
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Do I live near the west end?

799
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I do not.

800
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I do not live in the city.

801
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I am just outside of the city.

802
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Oh, a lot of peeps up here.

803
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Oh, we got a double area right there.

804
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
That's spy.

805
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Watch yourself.

806
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
That's me.

807
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:39,000
That's not me.

808
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Or is it?

809
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Twilight zone.

810
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I just got freaked out right there.

811
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Oh god.

812
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Oh.

813
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Spam out the door.

814
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Oh my god.

815
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Is that what I think it is?

816
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Is that burger boy?

817
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,000
It is.

818
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
That's not a spy.

819
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Do it.

820
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Go.

821
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Uh, I'm kind of doing this up then.

822
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Oh, appearance, appearance from MLC Dad.

823
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
MLC pop.

824
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
LNC pops.

825
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
MLC pops.

826
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yankees are better than red socks.

827
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Hoorah.

828
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
How could you say such a thing?

829
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Oh, I just got destroyed right there.

830
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Damn.

831
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Oh, no, this is spy.

832
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
We're going to get around.

833
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I'm going around.

834
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
They're taking over.

835
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Huh?

836
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
They're up on the top.

837
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Oh, nice reflect.

838
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
You know what?

839
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I'm going to go medic.

840
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
We need another one.

841
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
We need another medic.

842
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Auto-com inbound.

843
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Oh, auto-com inbound?

844
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yeah, what up?

845
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
In my next vlog, auto will do like a gameplay commentary.

846
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Oh, let me get that.

847
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Oh, no.

848
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
You heard it here first.

849
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Auto was going to do a gameplay commentary

850
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
of when I do my next vlog.

851
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Oh, god.

852
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
That's not safe.

853
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Oh, I'll leave one.

854
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I'll leave one.

855
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Oh, you got stopped.

856
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
No, we're about to have.

857
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
No, stay alive.

858
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Where is he?

859
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Where is he?

860
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Where is he?

861
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I'm trying to look too many people in the way.

862
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
All right.

863
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
What do you say, man?

864
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
What is it do it?

865
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Cretz everywhere.

866
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Cretz.

867
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Cretz.

868
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Cretz.

869
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Yeah, that's my dog.

870
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
People like who is auto?

871
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
That's my dog.

872
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
That's my good old dog.

873
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Gotcha.

874
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
No, no.

875
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
No.

876
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I'll be.

877
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Do it.

878
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I'm doing something.

879
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Oh, MLC mom.

880
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Do they have YouTube channels?

881
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Yeah, they do.

882
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
No.

883
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
They're doing Minecraft, don't they?

884
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Wow, you just saved my life.

885
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
No, I didn't.

886
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Sort of.

887
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Auto, auto the dog.

888
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Auto.

889
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Scout on the point.

890
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Trying to find him.

891
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Trying to find my dog.

892
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Auto.

893
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Did he just run in here?

894
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Okay, my dog just ran in here.

895
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I heard like the chinchy.

896
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm like looking at the screen.

897
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm not even looking down.

898
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I'm trying to like clap and get him to come over here.

899
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
No, he's not even in here.

900
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I'm like going insane.

901
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Look at all these people that need healing.

902
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,000
No.

903
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,000
That was lucky.

904
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I don't think he's dead, though.

905
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Oh, god.

906
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
All right, new course of action.

907
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I'm just charging up by Uber and they were going in.

908
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Do I know any Irish?

909
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I do not know any Irish.

910
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,000
How else do I know?

911
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
How I do I know Irish people, but I don't know

912
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
the language.

913
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,000
How to speak it.

914
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Oh, who do you know any Irish?

915
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I mean, even though you're not.

916
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I just buy it out of my face.

917
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I can't even speak Welsh, which is like my own,

918
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
my own city's language.

919
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I'm ready to have a language.

920
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I can't wait.

921
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
That has a really what?

922
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Welsh, yeah.

923
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,000
That's right.

924
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
No, no, no, no, really.

925
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Anyone speaks it in this country, though.

926
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,000
That's crazy.

927
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I don't know.

928
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
They have like an actual like, I thought they just spoke it with.

929
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Don't open that door.

930
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Burger boys out there.

931
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Oh, it would be bad.

932
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
It would be bad if burger boy got in here.

933
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Oh, close that door.

934
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Close that door.

935
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Do not let burger boy in here.

936
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
He just moved.

937
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And open it now.

938
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
No, don't open it.

939
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,000
What are you talking about?

940
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I love how we just got this guy here like holding this like,

941
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
all right.

942
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
What do we, uh, what are we doing here?

943
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Oh, turn around.

944
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Oh, jeez.

945
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
No, no.

946
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Oh, who loves.

947
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Oh my god.

948
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
They came from behind actually.

949
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
That's damn.

950
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
My god.

951
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm going to fugue.

952
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm going to fight.

953
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I'm going to go.

954
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,000
So.

955
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
The original sounds so cool.

956
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
If I was going to play Highland or what would I play for a class?

957
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Probably engineer.

958
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I'm like most comfortable playing engineer.

959
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I knew you were a freak.

960
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I could smell you.

961
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Can I feel it?

962
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Oh, I was waiting for him to try and stare at him.

963
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I got killed.

964
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Either engineer or maybe pyro.

965
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Just because pyro, I could probably do what we needed to be done.

966
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Hey, I'm pyro.

967
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
He's not dead.

968
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
There's no way he's dead.

969
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
No, come on.

970
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
No, here comes the chase.

971
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Restful media 28.

972
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I got people that are at restful media.

973
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It's one of your friends of mine that are there right now.

974
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Oh, it's a one.

975
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I haven't even done it.

976
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I'm seeing out of the rock.

977
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I used to be big into restful, man.

978
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I used to love it.

979
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Not so much anymore though.

980
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Oh my god.

981
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Hey, what's up everybody.

982
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I'm just going to like stuff myself into your face.

983
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Oh no.

984
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Yeah, you remember that time at Stone Cold's stunned the entire McMahon family?

985
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Actually, I do.

986
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I'll link that.

987
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And then the rock rock bottom.

988
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Oh my god.

989
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Somebody flew to the family.

990
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Just being an idiot right now.

991
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Oh, I can't play spines.

992
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It's not possible right now.

993
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Playing heavy.

994
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I'm not going to use.

995
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I'm going to use.

996
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Okay, we're being like 10 seconds.

997
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
BRBB.

998
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Check that one.

999
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
This one.

1000
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,000
That one.

1001
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
This.

1002
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I'll do one Minecraft.

1003
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I mean, we're trying to.

1004
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
The latest Minecraft thing that me left here in a Togs did.

1005
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
We're having a lot of server problems.

1006
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It would be crashing all the time.

1007
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And I don't know.

1008
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
We might try and do something else at some point.

1009
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Just because it was, hey, me.

1010
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Is that another spy?

1011
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I think so.

1012
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Oh, come on.

1013
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,000
We can do this.

1014
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Oh, no, we can't.

1015
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Eat the sandwich.

1016
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
The only thing you can do.

1017
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1018
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Where's my dog?

1019
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Auto!

1020
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Auto!

1021
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I'm going to get him in here.

1022
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Auto, you're going to do like a face cam video.

1023
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Auto face cam.

1024
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Let's see if I can do it.

1025
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Now he's not going to come in here.

1026
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
He's like, no way.

1027
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I'm back.

1028
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,000
They're all.

1029
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I help Mr.

1030
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
or mom on top of stuff or something.

1031
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Nice, nice.

1032
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I'm going to take the brass beast off of this one.

1033
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
What do I think these...

1034
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Oh, he used tummy.

1035
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
What's the worst game ever?

1036
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Oh, I don't know.

1037
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
What's the worst game I've ever played?

1038
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Borderlands.

1039
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
That's tough one.

1040
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
No, it's definitely not.

1041
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Not Borderlands.

1042
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Not for me.

1043
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It's not for me.

1044
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Borderlands.

1045
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I don't know what I have such a thing against Borderlands.

1046
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I actually did too.

1047
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
You made me bought it.

1048
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Oh, come on.

1049
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Don't kill him.

1050
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Oh, I'm not dead.

1051
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I just heard a spot.

1052
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
That's where the god I did.

1053
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah, I knew I did.

1054
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I knew I did.

1055
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I heard him, but I got killed anyways.

1056
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Wait, they have seven spies?

1057
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Oh my god.

1058
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Oh, there's another one.

1059
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
There's one.

1060
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Thanks.

1061
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Worst game.

1062
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Ah, recently the worst game I've played.

1063
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I can't think of one.

1064
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I heard that mermaid.

1065
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
About that, um,

1066
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Darkside, this is it.

1067
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Oh, something like that.

1068
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Darkside.

1069
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
We just always have to avoid this.

1070
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Something about this.

1071
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I don't know, a new game that came out, which is kind of like,

1072
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
ah, it was like an indie game.

1073
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I like Nova Dita playthrough on it.

1074
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I know it's called I Am Alive.

1075
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Go, get him off.

1076
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Oh, all right.

1077
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
This will be the last round.

1078
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
That was too quick.

1079
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Last round before we go DCS go.

1080
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Counter strike.

1081
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Go, go, go.

1082
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And what's ghost stand for?

1083
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Oh, just go.

1084
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Ghost.

1085
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Kind of strike like move, like move, go forward.

1086
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Might go.

1087
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I have to appear offline.

1088
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Oh, my fan.

1089
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Can you start?

1090
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Yeah, just, um, when we get into, uh,

1091
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
CS go to the top office.

1092
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
That's totally cool.

1093
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
That's totally fun.

1094
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
How do I do this?

1095
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Um, what am I doing?

1096
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
No, actually, I'll stay online.

1097
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Be honest.

1098
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I'll do that after we win the switch.

1099
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
All right, if we get rolled again,

1100
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
this is not good news.

1101
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Get your crits Creek on the pyro now for this boat.

1102
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Oh, yeah.

1103
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
You'll be able to see that video soon on Boom Man 61.

1104
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I, you actually will.

1105
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Come to you soon on the new team fortress to exclusive channel.

1106
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Just kidding.

1107
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I wish.

1108
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,000
No.

1109
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Let's do it.

1110
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Oh, that's a spy.

1111
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Holy moly.

1112
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Oh, my god.

1113
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Oh, why did I jump down?

1114
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Oh, dust balls crazy.

1115
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
It's like no respawns to, like no respond.

1116
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
We're getting absolutely destroyed right now.

1117
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Oh, my god.

1118
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
That's why he's still alive.

1119
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
All right, fall back.

1120
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Fall back.

1121
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Watch your back, Stu.

1122
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
But that's five.

1123
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
No, he got out of here.

1124
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Go, go, go, go.

1125
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
He's going to kind of slide out.

1126
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,000
He's going to slide out.

1127
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
He's going to slide out.

1128
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Thank you very much.

1129
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
You are the man.

1130
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Thank you, thank you.

1131
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Thank you.

1132
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
This way.

1133
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I'm going to slide out.

1134
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I'm going to slide out.

1135
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I'm going to slide out.

1136
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
All right.

1137
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Keep the deep fets.

1138
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Keep up the deep fets.

1139
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Oh.

1140
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Watch the spy gap.

1141
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Watch the spy gap.

1142
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
If I could be any class in TF2, I definitely would be the spy.

1143
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
You could just go invisible and not die in real life.

1144
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Yeah, you could just never die.

1145
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I go, hey, go ahead.

1146
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Shoot me in the face.

1147
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I'm going to go like, just let you step on a candle or something.

1148
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I'm fortunate like that.

1149
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Ha ha ha.

1150
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Yeah.

1151
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Yeah, you could just never die.

1152
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I go, hey, go ahead, shooting the face on a candle.

1153
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Just let you step on a candle or something.

1154
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I'm fortunate like that.

1155
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Ha ha ha ha.

1156
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Okay.

1157
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I go, yeah, you can go ahead and put like three bullets

1158
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
in my head then out of this dead ringer.

1159
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Ow.

1160
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
That�� has a spy.

1161
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
That'd be really weird.

1162
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Think about that in real life.

1163
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,000
That's the dead ringer, right?

1164
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Let's say, let's say you had a gun,

1165
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
and I had the dead ringer, and you shot me.

1166
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
And I had a dead ring around.

1167
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
So it would drop like a dummy like body of me,

1168
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
but I would still be alive.

1169
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
And I, what if I like appeared again?

1170
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Would it be the same body?

1171
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
What if you disguised as burger boy

1172
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
then you went to burger boy's house?

1173
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
And you're like, hey, burger boy.

1174
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Oh, I just talked to burger boys like parents.

1175
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Oh, hey, what's going on, Mr. and Mrs. Burger Boy?

1176
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
All right, block that spot.

1177
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I'm going to try and get him behind us.

1178
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Corona.

1179
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Careful.

1180
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Ooh.

1181
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Watch out, turn around, girl.

1182
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I turned around to fight the first fire.

1183
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And I got back stabbed by another spider game behind me.

1184
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
No, the theme is a spy.

1185
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Spy in the base.

1186
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Red is spy in the base.

1187
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Pie in the base.

1188
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
That's spy.

1189
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
No, it's not.

1190
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Can't hear that spy.

1191
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
That's a spy.

1192
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,000
No, it's not.

1193
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I am so conscious right now.

1194
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I'm like freaking out.

1195
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
That's a critter on a way.

1196
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Oh, you bastard.

1197
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
He's still alive.

1198
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
We need some serious spray action going on over here.

1199
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Oh, I'm going to go up.

1200
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
No.

1201
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Run, run, run, run.

1202
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Run away.

1203
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Run away from that.

1204
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Drive the sandwich.

1205
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Where's my sandwich?

1206
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Somebody eat it.

1207
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I just bumped into it.

1208
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I knew it.

1209
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I knew it.

1210
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Let's go this way.

1211
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Oh no.

1212
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Kilometric.

1213
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Oh my god.

1214
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Do I have my sandwich?

1215
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I don't have my sandwich yet.

1216
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Hold on, fall back.

1217
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Fall back.

1218
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Don't die.

1219
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
No.

1220
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Eat it.

1221
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
There we go.

1222
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
This is going to be a losing battle.

1223
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I don't want to do this.

1224
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Oh god.

1225
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I got a pack stat.

1226
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Oh.

1227
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah, at least we're holding them.

1228
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Yeah, at least we're holding them, right?

1229
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Man.

1230
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Is there a spy right here?

1231
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
What's going on there?

1232
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
That was like a freak out session.

1233
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Let's go.

1234
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Let's go.

1235
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Let's go.

1236
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Oh no.

1237
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Run, run, run.

1238
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Oh, the spyrope.

1239
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Oh no.

1240
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I should probably stop sniping.

1241
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
There's two spies behind us right now.

1242
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I East Day is going to be right here in two seconds.

1243
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Every time.

1244
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Oh no.

1245
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Run away.

1246
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Barely.

1247
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Oh, I'm going to still run away.

1248
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I'm going to still run away.

1249
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Oh.

1250
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I was actually something you guys are talking about.

1251
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Team Fortress and Chat.

1252
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
They're a classic version.

1253
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
You know what?

1254
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Oh.

1255
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Keep it.

1256
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Come on.

1257
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
You'll have the whole team.

1258
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Oh my god.

1259
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Epic Crit's Creed.

1260
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Oh my goodness.

1261
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
That spy still behind us.

1262
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
This could be really bad.

1263
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Oh, I knew it.

1264
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I was thinking about doing a Team Fortress one video.

1265
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Team Fortress classic video.

1266
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I think it'd be funny.

1267
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Showing like what it looks like then

1268
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
and what it looks like now.

1269
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Oh.

1270
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Oh, there's another heavy right there too.

1271
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Oh.

1272
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Dude, it's just out of you just did a.

1273
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Oh, get spread.

1274
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Give it to that thing.

1275
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Oh my god.

1276
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
They got a spy cap us.

1277
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Somebody came back there.

1278
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,000
The grenades in Team Fortress one was ridiculous.

1279
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,000
You could never go back and play that and really seriously

1280
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,000
play it.

1281
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It's just ridiculous.

1282
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
No, we know about the lose.

1283
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
We're your brosal lose.

1284
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
We are.

1285
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Oh, I'm going to play.

1286
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
No, I forgot.

1287
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:29,000
You can't do that anymore.

1288
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Shit.

1289
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I just threw the sandwich down for myself.

1290
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I was like, oh, I got more ammo.

1291
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Tremor, you can't do that anymore.

1292
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Team Fortress two with grenades would be, well, put it like this.

1293
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Imagine everybody on the team is a demo man

1294
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
and has their own loadouts.

1295
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Oh, we got to get up in that room.

1296
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
They're all up in that room.

1297
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Oh, this is the loadout.

1298
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Oh.

1299
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Yeah, this is this is where our foot number defense right now.

1300
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Oh, oh, my God.

1301
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
This is you again.

1302
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Oh, hit it.

1303
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Hit it.

1304
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Hit it.

1305
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Good.

1306
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Oh, how does he know?

1307
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Oh, my God.

1308
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Oh, no.

1309
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Yeah, that's what we get.

1310
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
That's what we get.

1311
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:47,000
All right.

1312
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Good medic.

1313
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Good medic is good.

1314
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Oh, nice counter Dracula voice.

1315
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1316
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Counter Dracula.

1317
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
What the heck?

1318
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Oh, boy.

1319
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Oh, they're trying to build up over here.

1320
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Oh, it's bad news.

1321
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Bad news, bears.

1322
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Watch out.

1323
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Back up.

1324
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I don't want to get killed.

1325
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Oh, it's dangerous.

1326
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I actually like all this.

1327
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Like what you're doing.

1328
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
A drama.

1329
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
What movie?

1330
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Bad news, bears.

1331
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
This is not.

1332
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I was like a baseball player and they said, hey,

1333
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
anybody's popular like thinks they're an actor.

1334
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I come to this like open audition thing.

1335
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So I tried to like try it and work.

1336
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Do you want to stop?

1337
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I can imagine Billy Ballford because I was in drama

1338
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
in like middle school.

1339
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
So I was like, I'm a good actor.

1340
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
You could have been a star, dude.

1341
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Who's concept?

1342
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Back up, back up, back up.

1343
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Hey, look what console just said.

1344
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Who?

1345
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
In the chatter and the.

1346
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Somebody said, oh, so you got your livestream right now.

1347
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Well, thanks for choosing the QQ buffet.

1348
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Oh, really?

1349
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
You were very welcome.

1350
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Oh, we're going in.

1351
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
We're going in.

1352
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
We're going in.

1353
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Right when they turn the cool.

1354
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Oh, well.

1355
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Oh, well.

1356
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Oh, I don't know.

1357
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
So this is like a legit stalemate right now.

1358
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I think because I want to get see us going.

1359
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
So we might have to like 16 on 16.

1360
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Yeah, this is just a totally balanced game right now.

1361
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Even though we respond to ladies on Dust Bowl.

1362
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah, I know.

1363
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
QQ.

1364
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Oh, he's going to go.

1365
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Oh, no.

1366
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Oh, I'm going to go.

1367
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
We got a ton of engineers, dude.

1368
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,000
We can't.

1369
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
No, no, no, take you to what you're either.

1370
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Oh, I hear the fan.

1371
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
See, your fan just turned on mine.

1372
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I just heard.

1373
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
And that's probably yours.

1374
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Actually, that probably was mine.

1375
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
You right?

1376
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
That's fine mine.

1377
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Oh, my look at this debris, that is my god.

1378
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Run, run away.

1379
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I'll be on the ground.

1380
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
That's run over there.

1381
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
After I think afterburn, you could tweak afterburn a little

1382
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
bit.

1383
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Make it a little more balanced.

1384
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Maybe you'd make it shorter duration, but more damage.

1385
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
So like instead of like 10 seconds or whatever it is,

1386
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
make it like four or five seconds, but have it do more damage,

1387
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
a little bit more damage.

1388
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It's OK in this current form, though.

1389
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I think I don't think it's that.

1390
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
It's not that bad.

1391
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Oh, my god.

1392
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Oh, come on.

1393
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Give me over there.

1394
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Oh, you got it.

1395
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Hello?

1396
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Hello, Mr. Medic.

1397
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
How are you?

1398
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I like how he just stood there.

1399
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And while we put mines all over him.

1400
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Oh, backstep.

1401
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
All right, I'm going to go.

1402
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I'm going to scout for the end here.

1403
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Man, it's such a difficult game to win.

1404
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Oh, my god.

1405
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Well, I don't think I've seen you once.

1406
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,000
No, I've been, I keep getting killed by Gemma.

1407
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Stop being so selfish.

1408
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I won't kill this girl.

1409
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Stop being so psyched.

1410
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I feel good.

1411
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I just, I mean, I got like, I was like,

1412
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
octo-heavy for this whole thing.

1413
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
It's like two or three medic zombie.

1414
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Not anymore though.

1415
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I'm saying I just scoot.

1416
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:27,000
No.

1417
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I went out this way.

1418
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Oh, where is he?

1419
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Imagine a team of 16 spies all just clogged,

1420
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
sneak on the point.

1421
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And at the same time, all decloat can capture them.

1422
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I'm going to say imagine that.

1423
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,000
And like they just like pretend that they're the other team.

1424
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
You know, I was the other team.

1425
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Super spyjack load.

1426
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Super spyjack.

1427
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Oh, no.

1428
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Oh, it's up.

1429
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It's up to me so long to get in the face with you.

1430
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Oh, man.

1431
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Do look at the, the medals.

1432
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
That's ridiculous.

1433
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I feel, I want to like switch to blue.

1434
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I can't though.

1435
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Oh, my, yeah, the domination like things.

1436
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Nice headshot.

1437
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Sick.

1438
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Come on, blue.

1439
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Oh, stealth.

1440
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Come on, blue man. 61.

1441
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Ready to charge.

1442
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Talk to.

1443
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I think I got a big century back there now.

1444
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Tables good turn right now.

1445
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
You guys got a good Uber.

1446
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Good like push coming.

1447
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Tables.

1448
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I'm not too sure about the Uber.

1449
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Is that Uber charge?

1450
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
What are you sure about the push?

1451
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Competence is growing slightly.

1452
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I'm standing in the tunnel not taking damage.

1453
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
That's a good one.

1454
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
What about this burger boy?

1455
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Did I hit you for a good boy?

1456
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
What was he doing?

1457
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I think there's nothing good about this team.

1458
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Oh, burger boy.

1459
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Burger boy.

1460
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
There's nothing good.

1461
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Yes, stealth.

1462
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I lost.

1463
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
There's nothing good about this team.

1464
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
That's so funny.

1465
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Things on fire.

1466
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I wish I could hear that.

1467
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
But I have my voice chat turned off.

1468
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
That would be funny to be able to watch that.

1469
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Burger boy.

1470
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
There is nothing good.

1471
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Really upset.

1472
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
All right, so burger boy.

1473
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
On a scale of one to 10, 10 being like you will rip down

1474
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
your house, burn your house down.

1475
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
And one being like, I guess I'm kind of mad.

1476
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
How like pissed off are you right now?

1477
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I bet you it's at least a seven or eight.

1478
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Let's be quiet so we can hear his answer.

1479
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I can't hear it.

1480
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
So it's going to be really late to me.

1481
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Actually, maybe he's not even listening to the stream.

1482
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
No, maybe he forgot I was streaming.

1483
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Oh, they got that.

1484
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Where's that spy?

1485
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
He's right there.

1486
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Oh, my gosh.

1487
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
What is that?

1488
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
What is that?

1489
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I heard on screen.

1490
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I'm breaking my brain.

1491
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Is that what he thought?

1492
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Damn it.

1493
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I wish I could have my.

1494
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I need to turn it on.

1495
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Oh, I need to turn it on.

1496
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Hold on.

1497
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Oh, my God.

1498
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
All right.

1499
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
You can tell him to do it again.

1500
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Burger boy, do it again.

1501
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Burger boy, rage again.

1502
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Is he going to do it?

1503
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Oh, he's not like actually mad.

1504
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I wish I caught that on video.

1505
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Oh, you're losing, burger boy.

1506
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
It's over.

1507
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Oh, look, it's all over.

1508
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Let's see what he says.

1509
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Hold on.

1510
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Here it comes.

1511
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Oh, what are you saying about that, burger boy?

1512
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Why are you talking to him?

1513
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I want him to flip up.

1514
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
He's your friend.

1515
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
No, I want him to flip up.

1516
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
He's silent.

1517
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
He's your friend.

1518
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Yeah, but I didn't bring you to the city.

1519
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Did he?

1520
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
No, he's still here.

1521
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
No, he's not.

1522
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Yeah, he is.

1523
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
All right.

1524
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I'm going to transition to CS go.

1525
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Oh, thanks for coming.

1526
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
No, you're not allowed to come.

1527
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Yeah.

1528
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Burger boy.

1529
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
This is the day of game.

1530
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
There's nothing good about this game.

1531
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
It's what he's doing.

1532
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Hi, let me try and figure out how to do CS go.

1533
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Could be sort of difficult.

1534
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
You're going to do windowed mode.

1535
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
It's going to take maybe a few seconds.

1536
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Give me a minute, guys.

1537
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Counter strike, global offensive.

1538
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
All right.

1539
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Screen's going to go black for 20 to 30 seconds.

1540
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Still here.

1541
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Don't worry.

1542
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Oh, no, black screen.

1543
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Oh, what do we do?

1544
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It's a black screen.

1545
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Oh, burger boy.

1546
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
You're listening right now.

1547
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
After we play this for like 20 to 30 minutes,

1548
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
we're going to McDonald's.

1549
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
We're going to get double cheeseburgers.

1550
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I hope you know that.

1551
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Video settings.

1552
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Where you're going to be playing in windowed.

1553
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And 1280 by 714.

1554
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I think I'm going to go and play cool of duty for.

1555
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
So I'll drop out the, I'll probably jump out the chat.

1556
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
But I'll still listen to the stream.

1557
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
OK, that's cool.

1558
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:53,000
All right.

1559
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Thanks for coming, dude.

1560
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Can you talk about you, though?

1561
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Because you're going to be listening.

1562
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Yeah, I can do.

1563
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I know what you're saying at all times, stealth.

1564
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Bomber.

1565
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
If you back later on, happy days.

1566
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
But enjoy CSGO.

1567
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Yeah, thanks for coming, Boo.

1568
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Thank you.

1569
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Bye, everyone.

1570
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Alrighty.

1571
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
So we're going to try and we're going to play some CSGO.

1572
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
We're going to play some gun game.

1573
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And if you have this, you're more than welcome

1574
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
to try and join in off of me or if stealth is

1575
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
appearing online him.

1576
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
It's going to be difficult.

1577
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Join in on these.

1578
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
It's going to be kind of difficult to get everyone in the game

1579
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:40,000
because it's um, wait, Valve confirms

1580
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
that Meet the Pyro is already done and ready?

1581
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Holy crap.

1582
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
That means we're going to get it soon.

1583
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Almost we don't.

1584
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Unless it doesn't happen.

1585
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Yeah, at least we don't get it.

1586
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I can't.

1587
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
If it's already released, cutting someone like sneak,

1588
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
like, I would steal that if I like work for Valve

1589
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
and put it on the internet.

1590
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
And then I get fired for a long time.

1591
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Yeah, you probably would get fired.

1592
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:10,000
That would not be good.

1593
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Oh, you get, you guys can hardly, they're quiet.

1594
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Are they still quiet?

1595
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Who?

1596
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
They like me?

1597
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Apparently you guys are quiet.

1598
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I don't know why.

1599
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I just try to turn you up.

1600
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
That's odd.

1601
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
So this is gun game.

1602
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
This is like legit, like, gun game.

1603
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Was it like that the whole time?

1604
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Or was it like that just for when I'd changed it over?

1605
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Was it like that during TF2 as well?

1606
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Oh, gun game.

1607
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Damn it.

1608
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Oh, so they were both low, really, really low

1609
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
for the team for us.

1610
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Oh, just at the end there.

1611
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
That's weird.

1612
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
The whole time?

1613
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
No, someone they were saying at the end of TF2.

1614
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Probably when I transitioned over.

1615
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Ow.

1616
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Yeah, so this is the gun game.

1617
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
This is my favorite thing about this game.

1618
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I love gun game.

1619
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I can't handle the game.

1620
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
All right.

1621
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Thanks for the feedback, guys.

1622
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I appreciate it.

1623
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Because I try to, it's hard to make it sometimes

1624
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
exploit is weird.

1625
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
And they just lower the volume of everybody.

1626
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I don't know why.

1627
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
But so thanks for thanks for being here

1628
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
to be able to tell me what's going on.

1629
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
So if you don't know what this is every time you get a kill,

1630
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
every single time you kill somebody,

1631
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
you get a different gun.

1632
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And I think it's 26 or 27 kills.

1633
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I don't see stuff as the worst counter strike

1634
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
player ever.

1635
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Oh, I must have it too in general.

1636
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
No, audio is fine.

1637
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Oh, well, I'm not standing still.

1638
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
But look at me.

1639
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
That's off of his prime.

1640
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Optimus Prime?

1641
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Oh, he's dead.

1642
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Oh, I'm going to get behind.

1643
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Oh, damn it.

1644
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
This is still in beta.

1645
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Yep.

1646
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
So as you see, when I kill somebody,

1647
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I'll see if I can show you.

1648
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Right when I kill somebody, the instant I do it,

1649
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I'm going to switch a gun.

1650
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
It's going to go to something else.

1651
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
This is the shot gun type thing.

1652
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I'd love to show them that example too.

1653
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
But I can't get a kill to switch my gun.

1654
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Hey, well, you're not really on the screen.

1655
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I was just saying.

1656
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Ah.

1657
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Yeah, this is PC.

1658
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I don't know.

1659
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
This is not really even getting developed right now

1660
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
for consoles.

1661
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I think they're doing that later.

1662
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I think it's actually code developed for five.

1663
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I could be totally wrong.

1664
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I'm not sure on that.

1665
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Oh, well, that's how you missed three times point blank.

1666
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Well, that was the auto shotgun.

1667
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Somebody's already reached knife level.

1668
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
So once you go through all the guns, once you get 27 kills,

1669
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
you use a knife.

1670
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
And you have to knife somebody.

1671
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And if you knife them, the game's over and you win.

1672
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Well, whatever team had the person knifeing.

1673
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Thanks.

1674
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Come on, keep it going.

1675
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Damn it.

1676
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Oh, that's game.

1677
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Oh, somebody wants?

1678
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Where's MLC still?

1679
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,000
There he is.

1680
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Oh, at the bottom of the ligabord.

1681
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Yeah, this is definitely the best mode in Counter Strike.

1682
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
No, I'm not opinion.

1683
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
It used to be a mod, then they made it

1684
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
like an actual game mode.

1685
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
It's so fun.

1686
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Hey, what's the enemy going?

1687
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Go CT.

1688
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
What up, what a deliq?

1689
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Yeah, I mean, the streams have been going for like an hour

1690
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,000
and a half now.

1691
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
So if some of you guys got to go, you got to go.

1692
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Thanks for coming.

1693
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Appreciate it.

1694
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Oh, I love this map.

1695
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I love this map.

1696
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,000
This is the map.

1697
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Shibby was like losing his mind on.

1698
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
There's only two maps on.

1699
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Oh, I love this one.

1700
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Oh, that's right.

1701
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:36,000
There is only two maps.

1702
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
What?

1703
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Damn it.

1704
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Oh, no, I don't bullets.

1705
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Wait, did there used to be a map?

1706
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Huh?

1707
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
There is.

1708
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Where?

1709
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,000
It's in the top left.

1710
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Do we talk about it?

1711
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Oh, because there's nothing up there for me.

1712
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Oh, well, you must have been glitching out.

1713
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Oh, there it is.

1714
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
It just came out there, dad.

1715
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Oh, I got a headshot from across the map.

1716
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Oh, I'm going to make a ton of hits and packs, man.

1717
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
It's going to me and Paxi.

1718
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
It's going to be best friends when it comes to videos.

1719
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Damn it.

1720
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I'm in trouble.

1721
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
No, run into bullets.

1722
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Oh, I'm in trouble.

1723
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Burger boy has a YouTube channel.

1724
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
His first video is going to be going up in, like, probably, like, 15 months.

1725
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Oh, God, yeah.

1726
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Show yourself.

1727
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Damn it.

1728
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I got to get a good stream together.

1729
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Oh, come on.

1730
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Damn.

1731
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I hear these people in the chat saying, like, this game of sucks.

1732
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Oh, wait.

1733
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
This game, this is the most fun game mode on C.S.

1734
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Oh, really?

1735
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Dad is going to stop that guy.

1736
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I don't think I did.

1737
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
We had that conversation last night.

1738
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
We were like, can you go and push it off?

1739
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
What's going on here?

1740
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Because I said I like damage the teammate when I landed on top of him.

1741
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Oh, my God.

1742
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I can't believe it.

1743
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
How many bullets does it take?

1744
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Damn.

1745
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
My favorite gun in C.S. Go is probably the shotgun.

1746
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
He just regular shotgun.

1747
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I love that thing.

1748
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Oh, come on.

1749
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
This thing.

1750
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
This is my favorite gun in C.S. right now.

1751
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I love this thing.

1752
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Unfortunately, when I get one killed, it's going away.

1753
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Oh, I see it's gone.

1754
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I don't know how you get kills in this.

1755
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
No one dies when I shoot him.

1756
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Is the auto-shotty?

1757
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Damn it.

1758
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,000
P90 is awesome too.

1759
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Everything is pretty balanced in this game.

1760
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
There's way too many of them over there.

1761
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:32,000
No way I was going to do that.

1762
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I'm not going to worst counter strike player.

1763
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I literally don't think.

1764
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
It's tough playing this game in a window.

1765
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
It is very hard to do this.

1766
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
My hand looks so tiny.

1767
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
It's like, yeah, I'm a little baby.

1768
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I can't believe I didn't kill him.

1769
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Do I like pretzels?

1770
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I love pretzels.

1771
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
World gold, baby.

1772
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I'm doing absolutely terrible right now.

1773
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Terrible.

1774
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I wish I could full screen this.

1775
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Alright, exploit.

1776
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Make it so I can full screen in my game.

1777
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
First problem.

1778
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
There's no hats.

1779
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Second problem.

1780
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
No hats.

1781
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Third problem.

1782
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
No lasers.

1783
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Oh, fourth problem.

1784
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Oh, my gosh.

1785
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
That killed me in sorry.

1786
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
That guy's already on the light machine gun.

1787
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Yeah.

1788
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I was doing pretty well last night.

1789
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Oh, that game begins already over.

1790
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
No, now.

1791
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Jeez.

1792
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I have a...

1793
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Yeah.

1794
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
That's Alex, I know.

1795
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I'm just saying.

1796
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I'm going to use the assies as a mirror.

1797
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
He's in the...

1798
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah, where is he?

1799
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Why is he not a mod?

1800
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
That doesn't make any sense.

1801
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
We don't, we don't trust him after I would have...

1802
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
After what happened.

1803
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I'm going to go T. Go T. Go Tarris.

1804
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
After he got into the cookie jar.

1805
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Oh, I really?

1806
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I really?

1807
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Well, I'm a moron.

1808
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:29,000
No, I'm not shooting my own teammates now.

1809
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Ah, I thought I was going to get him.

1810
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I'm going to get in Tri-Hard mode now.

1811
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I want to get a good game.

1812
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Tri-Hard mode.

1813
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Activate.

1814
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
3 and 2.

1815
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Let's go.

1816
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I want to be at least 1 to 2.

1817
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Oh, I didn't kill him.

1818
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
What?

1819
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Gotta get that gun game.

1820
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Gotta get that gun game up.

1821
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I didn't even see that guy.

1822
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I got to like blend it in with the background.

1823
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Let's go.

1824
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Let's go.

1825
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Keep it moving.

1826
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Keep it moving.

1827
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I literally think I'm doing 99% damage to people.

1828
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Other people are just taking the last shot.

1829
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Oh, LL Cool J in here.

1830
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Let me see if I can speak up on him.

1831
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
There we go.

1832
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
There we go.

1833
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
That's what I'm talking about.

1834
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Now we're going.

1835
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Now we're going strong.

1836
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Still on.

1837
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Keep it moving.

1838
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Keep it moving.

1839
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Oh.

1840
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Eggs.

1841
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I got to try hard like an egg.

1842
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Sure, my how do you have 14 freaking points?

1843
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I went into Tri-Hard mode.

1844
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Didn't I tell you?

1845
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
There we go.

1846
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I'm not messing around anymore.

1847
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
No more messing around, dude.

1848
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Let's go this way.

1849
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Sniper rifle.

1850
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Let's get one.

1851
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Hey!

1852
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Shabu!

1853
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Where is it?

1854
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
18 and 8.

1855
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Come on.

1856
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Give me like 10 more kills in a row, baby.

1857
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I'll be careful with this light machine gun, dude.

1858
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:51,000
That was, that was him killing.

1859
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Ah, come on.

1860
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
It's hot when you get to the pistols, it gets difficult.

1861
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
This is where it gets really difficult.

1862
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,000
It gets difficult when you're using any gun in this.

1863
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Come on.

1864
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Let's see what we got.

1865
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Ah, trying to pull up a headshot.

1866
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Not gonna happen.

1867
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Oh, come on now.

1868
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Come on now.

1869
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Come on now.

1870
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Oh, come on now, baby.

1871
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Ah, I had it.

1872
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I had it.

1873
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Come on.

1874
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Ah, damn it.

1875
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
No.

1876
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Crap.

1877
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Crap in my pants.

1878
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
No, this is not good.

1879
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I gotta find the way around.

1880
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Damn it.

1881
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Alright, I'm gonna... someone over here.

1882
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Oh, I can't believe that it had been the face.

1883
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I'm losing it now.

1884
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I'm losing it.

1885
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I had it.

1886
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I had it for a little bit.

1887
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
No.

1888
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Ah, I'm gonna lose it.

1889
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I'm gonna lose it.

1890
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:19,000
I was so far ahead.

1891
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Oh, I gotta kick off somebody.

1892
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:27,000
No one this way, man.

1893
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
There we go.

1894
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Finally got out of that stupid pistol.

1895
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I got the duel, but red is good.

1896
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Oh, this guy.

1897
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I'm gonna make this guy's day bad.

1898
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
This egg over here.

1899
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Where would this egg go?

1900
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I just had a clean shot on that egg.

1901
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Oh, my God, I can't believe I didn't get one.

1902
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
That was a lucky spawn.

1903
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Did I get it?

1904
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I did it.

1905
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Oh, I can't believe it.

1906
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I can't believe I wanted to get it.

1907
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
That's the first time I've ever had it.

1908
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I can't believe it's game so hard.

1909
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
All right, let's take the rage coin.

1910
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Yeah, that's the first time I've ever done that.

1911
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Well, that was a...

1912
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I wish I was like...

1913
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I wish I was like recording that.

1914
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Because it's probably not gonna happen again.

1915
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Oh, I'm recording that.

1916
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I own battlefield 3.

1917
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,000
So, please do not get battlefield 3.

1918
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I appreciate the gesture though.

1919
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Like, thank you so much for even considering doing that.

1920
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
But I have battlefield 3.

1921
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Oh, Boog, did you see...

1922
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I just wanted to see.

1923
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
That was for you.

1924
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Yeah, but I'm not...

1925
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
I don't...

1926
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
It's gonna be 360.

1927
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I guess I could use it.

1928
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I could use that.

1929
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Oh, you bastard.

1930
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Optimus Prime.

1931
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Hey, what do you know?

1932
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Optimus Prime has the knife in this game,

1933
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
and he's wicked good with it.

1934
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Coincidence?

1935
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I don't think so.

1936
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Ooh.

1937
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Ooh.

1938
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Give me that headshot.

1939
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Give me that headshot.

1940
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Oh, no.

1941
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Ooh.

1942
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
All right, I quit the game.

1943
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
You left?

1944
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Optimus Prime is pissing me off.

1945
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Oh, I guess he's wicked good.

1946
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Counter-strike source.

1947
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Did I say source?

1948
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I met Counter-strike.

1949
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Go.

1950
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Stealth can't take it.

1951
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Oh, jump down.

1952
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I was doing all right in the beginning.

1953
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I was doing all right.

1954
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
See if I can come back to life here.

1955
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
What?

1956
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
How does that make any sense?

1957
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
How did I kill that guy?

1958
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Did I shoot him for the great?

1959
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Now the hell did that happen?

1960
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Yeah, I'm not sure how much money it'll be.

1961
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I was assuming it won't be more than 50 bucks.

1962
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Probably want to be more than 40.

1963
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I bet you it's...

1964
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I'm gonna say 30 bucks.

1965
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
That's my prediction.

1966
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Again, I could be totally wrong.

1967
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,000
It really depends on what kind of strategy they want to go for.

1968
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Nope.

1969
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
16.

1970
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Damn it.

1971
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Stuff killing people.

1972
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I can't see what gun you have.

1973
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
This is gonna be tough sniper.

1974
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I'm gonna have to call a duty quick scope.

1975
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Where'd he go?

1976
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Where'd he go?

1977
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
How did I not hit him?

1978
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,000
There we go.

1979
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
LMG. Is that the real burger boy?

1980
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I better believe it.

1981
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,000
You better believe it.

1982
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Oh, Greg.

1983
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Oh, that's a bot.

1984
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Come on, I'm at the pistol level.

1985
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Come on, this is a bot.

1986
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Come on, this is a damn...

1987
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Damn it.

1988
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
22.

1989
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Somebody's already at the knife level.

1990
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
That's over.

1991
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
It is over.

1992
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
The TKO.

1993
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I believe he's the one that got it.

1994
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Good game.

1995
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I think I'm gonna hop out of CS going up.

1996
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I'm probably gonna use that gameplay.

1997
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I might actually use that one that I went ham on.

1998
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Ham, I had like a ham sandwich.

1999
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
A ham ham hamburger.

2000
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Oh, you're still here?

2001
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Me.

2002
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I thought you were like sad that you can't play CS.

2003
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I'm sad, I'm so bad, yeah.

2004
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,000
That's gonna wrap it up here, guys.

2005
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Thanks for coming, everybody.

2006
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
See you guys next time.

2007
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Oh, by the way, I need to make sure you guys all...

2008
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Oh, you're not even gonna do quap.

2009
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Oh, you're right.

2010
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
What am I thinking?

2011
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Am I out of my mind?

2012
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Cool off.

2013
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Gonna go black.

2014
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I thought you legit rage, but...

2015
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I thought you like, and sky call, and get me out of here.

2016
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I really thought you did that.

2017
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I was like, oh, he's gone.

2018
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I'm just going to scream.

2019
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Scream region.

2020
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Scream region.

2021
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Let's go for five lives on quap.

2022
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:36,000
See if we can't do something cool.

2023
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Here we go.

2024
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Just get good enough at the game so we can hear the music in the background.

2025
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
That's never gonna happen.

2026
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I will never get good enough at this game for that to not happen.

2027
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Quap looks like Grandpa trying to walk when he has no crutches.

2028
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I almost did a legit back foot.

2029
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Oh, thanks for reminding me, Wooded Delic.

2030
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
There is no stream next week, and there will be no stream.

2031
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I'm gonna be at Paxies, pretty much for the Hall Friday Saturday Sunday.

2032
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:17,000
So there will be no stream next weekend that I will try and do a make-up stream in the middle of the week sometime.

2033
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Probably...

2034
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I would say probably Thursday of that next week after that.

2035
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
So no stream next week.

2036
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:32,000
And I am just sitting here idling like a car.

2037
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

2038
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I'm doing like the skip method.

2039
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,000
The music just keeps coming in.

2040
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

2041
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I'm so bad at this. I can't even get the music to start playing.

2042
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

2043
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Alright, that's it. I'm not gonna get better than that.

2044
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
So yeah, thanks everybody so much.

2045
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I will see you guys all soon.

2046
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
And take care everybody. Thanks for coming so much.

2047
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
See you later.

2048
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Bye!

2049
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Yeah, bye.

2050
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Oh, and we...

2051
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
What's it all? I'm like frozen.

2052
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I think I'm frozen with a stream on.

2053
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Oh, so, hello. What's going on, everybody?

2054
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
It's the Jarvis Frozen computer screen.

2055
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
And...

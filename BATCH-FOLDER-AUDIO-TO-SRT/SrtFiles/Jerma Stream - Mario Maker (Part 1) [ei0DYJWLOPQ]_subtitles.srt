1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hopefully I'm not low now. That's the one scary part.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You're going to hear it echo in a second. I need to listen to it.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's my first time streaming from a console. I had no idea what the hell I was doing at all.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You're going to hear it echo in a second. I need to listen to it.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's my first time streaming from a console.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That should be good.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to have to watch chat on my iPad.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I can't have to turn and look at my screen.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It sounds better. You can still hear the game.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I should be able to. I hope.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can do it right here.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That would be swell if I could do that.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Can I?

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think so.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's go.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going to load up the chat.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I mean like fuck.

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to add on my iPad for splatoon.

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is just Super Mario Maker.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm going to get like in a better position here too.

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No. Looks like someone left this course unfinished.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's up to you to complete it.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh shit. I need my other iPad.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm hearing myself again. I need to put this.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This was not well planned.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It was my stylus.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm going to get my stylus so I can do this.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay. So we've to finish this level.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is Wii U. This is Mario Maker.

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why do I have two iPads?

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I have Wii U iPad.

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I have a regular iPad so I can read chat.

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm just covered in fucking iPads.

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm probably like microwaving my penis right now.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is bad.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's do it. Let me just turn this chat only.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You can do that on your iPad.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There you are.

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Follow the on-screen guidance and place elements to build.

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's just finish it.

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is cool.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's real cool.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Do you put goombas too?

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You can put like a million goombas.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I probably shouldn't be doing that.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We've got to finish the level.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is where you're going to put the bra.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Just like a regular Mario level.

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I get you.

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Fill it in.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Just like that popular video game Minecraft.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sure you've heard of it at some point.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You can't tell me what to do.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You can't tell me what to do.

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, hold on.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I can give it wings.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Can I give anything wings?

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You can.

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's beat the level now.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's do it.

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's do it.

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's undue.

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Let's just close this up.

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's get out of this tutorial.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's do it.

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What do you want me to do again?

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's just follow the instructions.

68
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's it, right?

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There's the goal.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
A race mode.

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Just some just going through to see what the hell the stuff all does.

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So now where's the...

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Where's the I'd like to play this level button?

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's like the start.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, that's what you can do with the start.

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's cool.

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I promise I'll get this.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This takes me a minute or two.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's what I did, isn't it?

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Does it want me to put him here?

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
For...

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, I guess it wants me to do this.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think.

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, okay.

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Give me the race button.

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I get it.

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I have to do it the way the game wants me to do it.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I can't do...

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can't be creative with the game yet.

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay.

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There we go.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
How's your course looking?

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Why not give it...

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm going to return to the beginning and give it a trial playthrough.

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Tap the S to go to the start.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I was below through this.

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Can I clear my own course?

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Of course I can.

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
See?

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I did that on purpose.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's get them all.

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh no, I died on my own tutorial level.

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's okay.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Sometimes you die on the tutorial level.

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Doesn't happen very often.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Jeez, what about what's spawning me in a random spot right there?

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I gotta say I'm not that keen on using this big ass iPad screen to play the game.

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll get my Wii U controller in my hand.

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay.

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Now, tap the course button to save your very first.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't want to save that.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
These little sucks.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay, well, looks like it's going here.

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Ah, not allowed.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Not allowed to call it that.

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Haha.

119
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Three new icons in a row.

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Didn't they have this stuff locked behind some type of nine day unlock system and then they went back on it or something like that?

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Whatever.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Can change the game or day and night underground.

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's cool.

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm not going to change the game up here.

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Super Mario brother.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is the new one.

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is the one for Wii U, right?

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's cool.

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And now what does it want me to do?

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What have we gone?

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, rocket ship.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You now go to the basic tools needed for the course creation.

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Try different combinations to see what you can come up with into the UQ,

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
course elements.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So it just wants me to mess around.

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, let's detonate this.

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's start over from the beginning.

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm trying to get my, I'm trying to look at my other iPad.

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
People used to, people set their clocks ahead.

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Was it daylight savings time?

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
All right.

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What even is this?

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, okay.

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's a real easy level.

145
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay.

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You want me to go to the main menu.

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Touch.

148
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The key to making fun courses playing lots of courses.

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Sure.

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So this is where I can play other people's levels, right?

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I guess.

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's do it.

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's see what these people got.

155
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What did it just take for me?

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Stuff is unlocked by pacing.

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, auto almost broke the Wii U.

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know what it is with my dog, but he's, what the fuck?

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's, again, my dog and flies.

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If there's a fly in the house, he loses his mind to a point where he just starts

161
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
rambling into walls and shit.

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He starts crashing into everybody.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Thanks for the one up.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Does somebody make this level?

165
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm assuming they did.

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What?

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Get out of here.

168
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But anyway, so.

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh my god, that was cool.

170
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So there was a fly in the house and he ran into a bunch of chords and ripped the Wii U off the shelf and landed on the ground.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I thought it broke.

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's kind of cool.

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
See, this person knows what they're doing.

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
All of my levels are going to suck.

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Dude.

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
He's got doors too.

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Cool.

178
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This is a green door.

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm about to fall.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay, that was cool.

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, this is an official Nintendo level.

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We're just going to go next.

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Try Blung and Blow through these.

184
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This just goes fast as we can so we can get to the most important thing.

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And that's making a level.

186
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
This is Super Mario Maker, not Super Mario World.

187
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Well, this one's the different Mario.

188
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
All right, we're going to go off shit really.

189
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Is it?

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Where's the door?

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Where's the innovation Nintendo?

192
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Can I whack that?

193
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You have a double jump.

194
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I thought you could jump on the wrenches.

195
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I was certain you could jump on the wrenches.

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You're going to give me nine tries to do this.

197
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
All right, let's go.

198
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Blow through it.

199
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'll go this door this time.

200
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Let's go.

201
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:27,000
People saying some at some point is laggy.

202
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't know.

203
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Maybe that's something to do with how I'm pulling through the connection.

204
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh, oh, the Strayva is lagging.

205
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Somebody.

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Wait, this is the...

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I already did this one, didn't I?

208
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh, did that just make a horn?

209
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Like a clown horn?

210
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know.

211
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You can do sound effects too.

212
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's cool.

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It might just be a rough patch of my internet.

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It happens sometimes with this...

215
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The router I have is kind of a piece of shit.

216
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You can record your own voice in these.

217
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh, my goodness.

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We're definitely doing that.

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Watch out for boo.

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Fuck.

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh, no, no.

222
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm just trying to do the rush tactic.

223
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You know, we're still going to do the rush tactic, I think.

224
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
No, we're not.

225
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's just go.

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
See ya.

227
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Generic bird noises.

228
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Recorded voices only play on welcome machine, not online.

229
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's still kind of cool, though.

230
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Help.

231
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
When his tip of the hat starts, it's tomorrow Saturday.

232
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Ooh, this is Mario 3.

233
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's cool.

234
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How many different Mario games are in this?

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I did not know.

236
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I actually did not know that that's what that was.

237
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I thought that was just a little thing I could jump on.

238
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And then fire went right up my ass.

239
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh, I got to ride this, I think.

240
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What?

241
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What?

242
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What was this in here?

243
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm going to hit him like 50 times, it'll break.

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
All right, we did that and do something over here, then.

245
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm going to hit him.

246
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I guess not.

247
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Huh.

248
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh, you pick these up, can't you?

249
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You said that you could.

250
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You know, you wait for the P block to come over.

251
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What the fuck am I supposed to give that?

252
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh shit, that shoots fireballs too.

253
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's good to know.

254
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
A piece which is journey, but I guess it's in the title.

255
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh, okay.

256
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I have to knock it up there, so I get it.

257
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
There it is.

258
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Here it comes.

259
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I actually require that.

260
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Requires a lot of timing.

261
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh my fucking god.

262
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I waited for the exact moment where that was going to happen.

263
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's going to be a long night.

264
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If I'm going to do shit like that.

265
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Not even going to watch it.

266
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Just stay over here.

267
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Come on.

268
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Come on, I'm getting antsy.

269
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Come on, I'm getting antsy.

270
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Don't, I hope that go for it doesn't steal it.

271
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Do I have to go up?

272
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No, I don't.

273
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah.

274
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
There we go.

275
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah, somebody asked about Superhead.

276
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Superhead starts tomorrow at 12.

277
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I think.

278
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
This is Mario World.

279
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I used to love this game.

280
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This is a fantastic game.

281
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay.

282
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm going to take it.

283
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Why would it give me another one?

284
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There's definitely a reason why it gave me another one.

285
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Take?

286
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh shit.

287
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh fuck.

288
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That's why.

289
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You know, my brain was clicking there for a second.

290
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I saw the stairs going up and I'm just like, oh no.

291
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I shouldn't have done that.

292
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Good thing there's infinite amount of them.

293
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
No, I don't even need to do that.

294
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
There's no reason to do what I've just did.

295
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
See?

296
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
There we go.

297
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I actually just made that harder for myself.

298
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:56,000
There we go.

299
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
All right, for it to open.

300
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
That was annoying.

301
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay.

302
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That was screaming.

303
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yay.

304
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's it.

305
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
All right.

306
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Thanks for coming to the stream.

307
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I just beat Super Mario Maker.

308
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Game over.

309
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I won.

310
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Am I going to make an impossible level?

311
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm going to try and make a weird one.

312
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't know about impossible.

313
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I don't know about impossible.

314
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Ooh.

315
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Something about the aesthetic of Mario 3 is just such a cool looking game.

316
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Out of all the Mario's, it's probably my favorite looking Mario.

317
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Just do it how everybody looks cool.

318
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Wait a minute.

319
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Can I still work?

320
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Didn't this do something in the other game?

321
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I think I did.

322
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I thought I fucked that one up.

323
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll put the kick it that way.

324
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But these things distracted me.

325
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
There's so many of them.

326
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
How do you get them stacked like that?

327
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Whoa, that's not.

328
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's weird.

329
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Let's fly.

330
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Whoa, that was awesome.

331
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What innovation?

332
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Seriously Nintendo?

333
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What innovation?

334
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Let's fly.

335
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Here we go.

336
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Can I get the one up?

337
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
This isn't enough for me to run and fly.

338
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I hope so.

339
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yep.

340
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
No!

341
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Shit.

342
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Nah, it doesn't go anywhere, whatever.

343
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I believe no, these are not custom levels.

344
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
These are the Nintendo official sample courses.

345
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
This is the last level here, I think, right?

346
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I just hope so.

347
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I think I got seven lives.

348
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Lucky number seven.

349
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That'd be okay.

350
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Just don't even stop running.

351
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Don't stop at anything.

352
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
See?

353
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You just can't stop moving.

354
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
There's the secret to every Super Mario Brothers.

355
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Each shit.

356
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I just beat that like, I'd be like, that'll problem.

357
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Because I did the don't stop moving to active.

358
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Magic flute, I remember the magic flute.

359
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The thing is so cool.

360
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Sorry, your princess is in another castle.

361
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
What was he saying?

362
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He's not paying attention.

363
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
To be continued, please buy Mario Maker 2.

364
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
New courses will become available each time you complete this mode.

365
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
There are lots of fun courses to play, so be sure to come back again soon.

366
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay.

367
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Well, should I just go back to the main menu?

368
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Course World.

369
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Let's do that.

370
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Let's see some of the cool shit that people have made.

371
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Comment on use courses, okay?

372
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Okay, cool.

373
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
That sounds like fun.

374
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What the hell's going on there?

375
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Oh, he's doing sit-ups.

376
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Okay.

377
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Good to know.

378
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
100 Mario Challenge courses, makers, let's just go to courses.

379
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Featured.

380
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Mr. Chomp's dog house.

381
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I mean, look at that.

382
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
What the hell's going on here?

383
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Let's do it.

384
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Mr. Chomp's dog house.

385
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay, whatever.

386
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah, I gotta ease in.

387
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
We're gonna take these really slowly, because some of these levels are probably extremely difficult.

388
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Go up if you want to have- oh, fuck.

389
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We did it.

390
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
We already died.

391
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What does that say?

392
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Go up if you want to.

393
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What?

394
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Go up if you want an easier time.

395
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
There's another way for me to go besides up.

396
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Oh, no, this right here.

397
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Okay.

398
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Oh, no, we're gonna go to the right.

399
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
We're not gonna go up.

400
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Wait for the- now go.

401
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Ooh, that was close.

402
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That was real close.

403
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That was an accident is what that was.

404
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Ooh.

405
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Oh, geez.

406
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
These hammer brothers.

407
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:54,000
This is- and fireballs.

408
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That's gonna be hard.

409
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That's gonna be real hard.

410
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Is there a mushroom over here?

411
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
No, we're not doing the- I forgot that that was there.

412
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Alright, so this is like one of the harder levels.

413
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Where's like the your 11?

414
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Welcome to Super Mario levels.

415
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You know, you kinda just have to memorize everything.

416
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You should be good to go.

417
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Oh, yeah, like that.

418
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Like that.

419
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I should fucking memorize that too.

420
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
What?

421
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Attack.

422
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
What am I doing?

423
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm missing the most important tactic of all.

424
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Are you serious, guys?

425
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I would have had it if I had gone when I should have gone.

426
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Oh, fuck every time.

427
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I keep forgetting that this- that comes right down.

428
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I need to wait.

429
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
How long is this level?

430
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's probably much longer than this, too.

431
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:19,000
God.

432
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Alright, so we're gonna- we're gonna do this one more time.

433
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And then I'm going to rage quit and play a different one.

434
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
No, watch out.

435
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, fuck me.

436
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I never go into beat this level.

437
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
If you gave me a thousand dollars to beat this level in the next ten minutes,

438
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I don't think it would happen.

439
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Oh, my god.

440
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I see I'm rushing it now.

441
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
They have fucking Russian.

442
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Too much rice.

443
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Alright, one more try.

444
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm gonna go up.

445
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
We'll see if it's an easier time to go up.

446
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Like, like, he states in the instruction manual.

447
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
This does look easier.

448
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
There's a mushroom.

449
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Okay.

450
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That isn't easier time.

451
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Give me this thing.

452
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Okay, give me the fuck out of the way.

453
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Give me out of this level.

454
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Let me skip the whole level.

455
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Oh, god.

456
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The cloud's gonna end.

457
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Where's the entrance?

458
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Shit, it's a door.

459
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Shit.

460
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Now I gotta do that.

461
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
That going through here with the hammer brothers is seriously, geez.

462
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Gonna wait for a good opportunity.

463
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Just stop moving.

464
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Stop this thing.

465
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I love a god.

466
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
They're all on the ground.

467
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
They're down, down, down.

468
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Throwin', throwin', throwin'.

469
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
He's gonna start moving again.

470
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Oh fuck.

471
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Mmm.

472
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You were doing an easy way again.

473
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Nope.

474
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You gotta have momentum to do an easy way.

475
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Like that.

476
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
This time I shouldn't lose the mushroom.

477
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Because I know what's down here.

478
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Give me that.

479
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Oh my fucking god.

480
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
What happened there?

481
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Okay, how do I say I give up?

482
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And I'd like to play a different course, please.

483
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Here we go.

484
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's a cool level.

485
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Now what else is there?

486
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So what does this mean?

487
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
13 out of 44?

488
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Like what does that mean?

489
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I was right at the end too.

490
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Is this underwater?

491
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Jump or dead?

492
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Okay.

493
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm gonna do jump or dead.

494
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
This one's called jump or dead.

495
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Let me get this like fucking iPad off my stomach.

496
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I have two of these iPads on me.

497
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's causing me all kinds of discomfort.

498
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
See, look at him.

499
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm like moving and shitting.

500
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I don't want to be.

501
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Let's see here.

502
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
This is like yellow.

503
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I didn't play any of these old Mario,

504
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
so I don't know what the hell these things are.

505
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Okay, well, I didn't really do much.

506
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm confused already.

507
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Okay.

508
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
What does that stuff do?

509
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Alright, so if I can, I can wall jump.

510
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I think I get it.

511
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I think you have to just land on that one softly.

512
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I think.

513
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Okay, no, you have to bring it with you.

514
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Holy shit, what the hell is going on?

515
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Does things just firing all kinds of power-ups at me?

516
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Alright, well, can I jump on their heads?

517
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yes, I can.

518
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Let's just move.

519
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Got it.

520
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Wait, no, I can have wall jump.

521
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Or do I?

522
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yeah.

523
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I have no idea.

524
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I have no idea.

525
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
At least I know what to do.

526
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
This one, I'll just wait.

527
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Should I bring this with me?

528
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I feel like I should just bring it with me.

529
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I think my life a little easier later.

530
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I guess I can't bring it with me anymore.

531
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Get out of here, you giant gumbas.

532
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Oh my god.

533
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Okay, that was weird.

534
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:59,000
That was very weird.

535
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Holy shit, dude, I'm so fucking bad at this game.

536
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's like unbelievable.

537
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I got it.

538
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Hey, look, I picked up the fucking item.

539
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Hey, you know those things when I told you about like having to be very like pay a ton

540
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
of attention when you're playing a game?

541
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
This is one of those games.

542
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
What the fuck was I thinking?

543
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I should just like play, I should just like actually make a level.

544
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I'm getting more fun than dying over and over again.

545
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Wait, this is a dick?

546
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Is that what people are saying?

547
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Okay, maybe it is.

548
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
That's gonna wait.

549
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It just like spits out a ton of things.

550
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
What is going on there?

551
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Why does it keep doing that?

552
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Alright, something's going on here.

553
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Why do I keep going down?

554
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
What the fuck was that?

555
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Jesus!

556
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
We're gonna go to like the little kid ride.

557
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Where's the kid ride?

558
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Is there, are there levels like specifically designed for fucking old people?

559
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Let's take a look at the up and coming.

560
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Wow, look at that one.

561
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Three course meal.

562
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Let's check out this one.

563
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Actually, I'm gonna use this.

564
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Forget about the We-Mo controller.

565
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I keep doing like ground pounds.

566
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Okay, that one falls.

567
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That feels a lot better in my hands now, other than sitting here playing it.

568
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I say that now.

569
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Fuck.

570
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So I have to break in my hands now.

571
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Get in there.

572
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Ah!

573
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Holy shit, this is fucking terrible.

574
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm so bad at Mario.

575
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Alright, can I get past like the fur?

576
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Look it up there.

577
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You think I'm gonna get by that shit?

578
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Oh.

579
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Oh God.

580
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I can't fucking play this game.

581
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Alright, I'm gonna sound like a crazy person here.

582
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Maybe I'm a crazy person.

583
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But I feel like I have an input delay.

584
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I really think I do.

585
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Because when I'm hitting the jump button, it's almost like it's happening like...

586
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Maybe like two to three hundred milliseconds later.

587
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Maybe that's what's happening.

588
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm just gonna tell myself that's what's happening.

589
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I think it is happening.

590
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Alright, we're gonna go up.

591
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Can I like plug this thing in?

592
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Just read it or something.

593
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Maybe no idea what's going on.

594
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But gosh darn it.

595
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm protected.

596
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
That's really cool.

597
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
That's a cool idea.

598
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I like this way better.

599
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
This one gives you the helmet.

600
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Oh, dear.

601
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
How did I get through this?

602
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I guess there's weight.

603
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Just wait.

604
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
They'll all just murder each other.

605
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
That's perfect.

606
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Okay, come on.

607
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Get the fuck away from me.

608
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Hey, look guys.

609
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I beat a level.

610
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Do I sound like I'm like one second behind I do?

611
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I don't know.

612
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Maybe that's what's going on.

613
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I gotta figure that out.

614
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Let's see what's going on.

615
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Okay, okay, I'm gonna...

616
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
How do I give this like a 10 star rating?

617
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Like I beat your level.

618
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Good job.

619
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
How do I say that?

620
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
That was cool.

621
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I don't know.

622
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You comments?

623
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Around the comments.

624
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I don't want to let up the me verse.

625
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
No, I don't want to get me back.

626
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Close the me verse.

627
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm gonna make a level.

628
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
If I'm having trouble jumping,

629
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,000
then I can't really play Super Mario Brothers if you can't jump.

630
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Where's the stylus?

631
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
What I do with it?

632
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I want to make a level.

633
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I had it sitting here.

634
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Maybe in one of my tie raids, I just threw it.

635
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Did I throw it?

636
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I don't think I threw it.

637
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Now, why would I have done that?

638
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Let's go back to the menu.

639
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I guess I can do it with a man.

640
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Let's make a cool course.

641
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Touching a me bow to the...

642
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I don't have an me bow.

643
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Then one me bow is here.

644
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Okay.

645
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Let's reset this whole thing.

646
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
All right.

647
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I don't think I want to do this Mario.

648
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Let's go daytime.

649
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Is there a way I can extend that to?

650
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
All right.

651
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
This one's gonna be called Mushroom City.

652
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It'll be very particular.

653
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It'll be very, very difficult.

654
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You see?

655
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Start here.

656
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Here's one of the stairs there.

657
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
You need to hit that.

658
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And inside of that, we have Mushroom in that one.

659
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And then you get that Mushroom.

660
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And then you go down a little.

661
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Let's clean this up.

662
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Let's put that there.

663
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Put a pipe over here too.

664
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,000
No, I just want one pipe.

665
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
How do I extend the pipe?

666
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Should be able to do right.

667
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I gotta have a Goomba over there.

668
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,000
That's the very scary enemy that you first encounter.

669
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
There's some bricks down here.

670
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
There goes like that.

671
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
No.

672
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
We gotta go back to this.

673
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Couple of coins.

674
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Mushroom, because you know this is Mushroom City.

675
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You can't have it be Mushroom City without a bunch of mushrooms there.

676
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And then we got a couple of things there.

677
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
A long jump.

678
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Be aware of this long gap.

679
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Ladies and gentlemen, you might not make it.

680
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Now fuck that.

681
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Now you move.

682
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
No.

683
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Now you might not make it.

684
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You have like a broken blue.

685
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You know, just to like just to just to piss you off a little block there.

686
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Oh, there's a broken block there.

687
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Fuck you, I did.

688
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Like that.

689
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Mushroom City.

690
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Like this.

691
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Mushroom City, you know, fucking Mushroom City.

692
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And there you go.

693
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you a Mario Maker level that was made by a seven-year-old.

694
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
If I gave this Mario Maker to like my little cousin or something,

695
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and I said, hey, make me a level junior.

696
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
That's it.

697
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
That's it.

698
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Mushroom City.

699
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Very good.

700
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Very good.

701
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
This is wonderful.

702
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Let's play it.

703
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Oh, why did I start here?

704
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
This is not how Mushroom City is supposed to be.

705
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Did I mess up?

706
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Did I mess it home on?

707
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I messed it up.

708
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
That it.

709
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Where's my spawn point?

710
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Right here, right?

711
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Is there a...

712
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Like start.

713
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Yeah, start right here.

714
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So what the hell is this?

715
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
All right, it's just where I'm standing from.

716
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I get it.

717
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
All right, let's play.

718
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
What do you think there's in there?

719
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Mushroom.

720
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah, now this is what I'm talking about.

721
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Now this is like a Mario level.

722
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I can get behind.

723
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Say it's just jumping around.

724
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
What is going on with that?

725
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Whatever.

726
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
We have to expand.

727
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
This is not good enough.

728
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
No, you know what?

729
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
This is how this is going to work.

730
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You can't touch this yet.

731
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Delete some of those.

732
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Let's go up here.

733
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:49,000
This is really cool that you can actually do this.

734
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Is this even going to work?

735
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Can I like jump up here like this?

736
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I think you can.

737
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
There it is there.

738
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
This doesn't need to be there.

739
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
New course elements will arrive on Sunday.

740
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Okay.

741
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Put a guy here.

742
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
For pipe right there.

743
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
There we go.

744
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Where is the...

745
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
There it is.

746
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Move this.

747
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
You go up there.

748
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:48,000
That's going to be a hazard.

749
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Coin right above them.

750
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
The troll the people that want to play level lake.

751
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Look at all these coins.

752
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
You're going to get eaten by the thing from the little shop of ours.

753
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,000
They have all shrimp in there.

754
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
See that they can't get these.

755
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
They are going to be very disappointed that they can't get those.

756
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Good.

757
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah, just a couple of coins.

758
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
This is going to go up.

759
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
How much further up can I go?

760
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Then you have to fall.

761
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But the real scary part about falling.

762
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
As you never going to know what lake you might like run into.

763
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Let's test it.

764
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Test it.

765
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:52,000
We'll go from up here.

766
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Thank you.

767
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Thank you very much.

768
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I got a mushroom.

769
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Nice.

770
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
That's a fuck.

771
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I think I might have just...

772
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Where is he?

773
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Oh, there he is.

774
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
We fall.

775
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
See? What a hazard.

776
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:33,000
What a hazard.

777
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I think I understand the basics of how to do this.

778
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Now let's make a real level.

779
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Do I have to play through the other shit to unlock the other stuff?

780
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I'm assuming I do.

781
00:47:46,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It seemed like there was like the other courses to do.

782
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
This is a...looks perfect.

783
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Publish that map.

784
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
That map would give zero stars.

785
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And people would tell me like how much I like suck.

786
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
What's the 100 Mario challenge?

787
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I don't know.

788
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Let's take a look at it.

789
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,000
See what it is?

790
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
100 Mario challenge.

791
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You get 100 lives to clear 8 courses.

792
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Take on different courses every time you play from makers all around the world.

793
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Sounds straightforward enough.

794
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Although they give me you 100 lives.

795
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I don't know.

796
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You saw how much of a catastrophe the last time I tried to play like the more...

797
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
The featured levels was.

798
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Who knows what the hell is going to happen here.

799
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So these are just random levels from the community.

800
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
That's really, really cool.

801
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Whoa.

802
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
What does that mean?

803
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
What is happening right now?

804
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I can't jump in that.

805
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I thought you could jump in those.

806
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Can you and I just...

807
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Did I miss it or something?

808
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I thought you could fly around on those things.

809
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
There's got to be something in one of these.

810
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
You wouldn't put these all here.

811
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Right?

812
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
You wouldn't like these all that, but out...something.

813
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Is that a fireball?

814
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Is it a fireball coming right at me?

815
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Oh, he shoots it down.

816
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Okay.

817
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Oh, whatever.

818
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
What is going to skip that?

819
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
This is a big smiley face.

820
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
You can go in them.

821
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Is that Bowser?

822
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:15,000
That was Bowser and Bowser Jr.

823
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Of course, it's too difficult.

824
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You can press on it by touching it.

825
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Oh, okay.

826
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
It's giving me the use suck.

827
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Please don't hurt yourself in Mara.

828
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Don't like strain yourself.

829
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Is what it's saying.

830
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It's like bumper cards.

831
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Okay.

832
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
This is impossible to do somebody said,

833
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
okay, well, we'll be the impossible.

834
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
The impossible loss.

835
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Is it safe and quit?

836
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
For what?

837
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Just in case you can't do it anymore?

838
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Well, for ten levels, hundred lives.

839
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
That seems like a lot.

840
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Holy shit, I thought those were gopies.

841
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
What is happening to my character?

842
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
What?

843
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
How do you figure this shit out?

844
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
The game's only bit off like a week.

845
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Get up there.

846
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
What?

847
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Is it like a beanstalker?

848
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I'm not sure.

849
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
There you go.

850
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
That was there.

851
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I was wondering why the f-

852
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
That was an awesome level.

853
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I wish I could give that one two thumbs up.

854
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Oh, boy.

855
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I'm not sure yet.

856
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Outta my way.

857
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I feel like I made this level.

858
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Okay.

859
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Well, that was pretty good one too.

860
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Where were these before?

861
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I feel like I found the jackpot of dumb goofy levels

862
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:36,000
and I'm not sure if I can find it.

863
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So, I hate the water levels.

864
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Give me like 98 lives.

865
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm scared to go and get it.

866
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
More important.

867
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Whatever.

868
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It didn't even matter.

869
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:01,000
These levels of the people just spam the enemies everywhere.

870
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000
This is easy.

871
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
This is easy.

872
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
This is really easy.

873
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Why would I even go up?

874
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm not going to go up though.

875
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
It would be a terrible mistake.

876
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So, yeah, this is a...

877
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
This is Mario Maker.

878
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
This is very long.

879
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Okay, this is kind of scary in me a little bit now.

880
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
What are the cannons for?

881
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
They're just shooting them out.

882
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Why is this so long?

883
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Okay, now I understand why those ones that were featured were featured

884
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:53,000
because people make hallways with spammed monsters.

885
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Yeah, why would you even go up there?

886
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Unimpossible.

887
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Yeah, that was an unimpossible level.

888
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Still have 100 lives.

889
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
What do you know guys?

890
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Here's another fucking nightmare level.

891
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm not even going to get it.

892
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:32,000
It's hurting my eyes.

893
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
This level's giving me a headache.

894
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
The star is here too.

895
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Well, already been.

896
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,000
It's just a goof.

897
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
What the fuck is Bowser at the end?

898
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:00,000
This probably took the person a long time because every space is a coin.

899
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Let's just go this way.

900
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Can I even go anywhere?

901
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
No, no, so he got lazy up here.

902
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Does there are a few spots where there are not coins?

903
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I guess I don't need a bump there.

904
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Who needs a bump there?

905
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Did I win?

906
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Is this the end?

907
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It was the three Bowser's.

908
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I think I got a star bait.

909
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
So random levels, you're probably going to 90% of the time get weird ones like that.

910
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
This one's different.

911
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Let's see what the difference is here.

912
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Does Booz going to fall on me?

913
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Those doors.

914
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I got to have Bowser in your level.

915
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Like, he's just in here.

916
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Make sure there's at least a boy.

917
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Give him credit for that one.

918
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
That was cool.

919
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I wish I had any idea how to actually attack Bowser in these games.

920
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Oh, well, that's the trigger buttons.

921
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Gosh, Jeremy, you sure are great at this game.

922
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Over halfway through, and you still have 100 lives.

923
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I don't know, Star.

924
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I'm not sure if you can even put checkpoints.

925
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I think you can.

926
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Maybe in the older Mario games.

927
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Get inside of the clown guy.

928
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Make sure to go down and over and up.

929
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I really enjoyed putting these arrows down.

930
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Where is this take really, really, really, now.

931
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
No, hold on.

932
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
No.

933
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
What?

934
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
This guy didn't, he made this whole elaborate level.

935
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
But you just to be able to skip the entire thing?

936
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Look at how this worked this guy put in.

937
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,000
All for seemingly no reason.

938
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yeah.

939
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
This is just all for show.

940
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
This is all for you to look at.

941
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Okay.

942
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Can I?

943
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
No, I can't even go down in here.

944
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Sweet.

945
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:09,000
That beat it.

946
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Goomba, torture chamber.

947
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Maybe we can...

948
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
These are too easy.

949
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Maybe at the final level, I only have 100 attempts to beat this last level, guys.

950
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
At least a different game.

951
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:40,000
There's another one over there.

952
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Well, I asked for the easy grandpa levels.

953
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:49,000
These are definitely the easy grandpa levels.

954
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I don't know.

955
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Bowser's over here.

956
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
That's a very strange Bowser.

957
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
What game is that Bowser from?

958
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
What game is this Bowser from?

959
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I'm like...

960
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It's flabbergasted right now.

961
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Whatever.

962
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Oh, you can't go through it.

963
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Is that like a DS Bowser?

964
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
This is...

965
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I can't lose this.

966
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It just spits these flowers out over and over again.

967
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I might as well just stand here and tap as fast as I can.

968
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I did it.

969
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
So, I beat the 100 Mario Challenge.

970
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:43,000
What do I get?

971
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:51,000
No Bowser like that in any game.

972
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Can I skip this?

973
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Yeah, I'll do the normal version.

974
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,000
course design

975
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
what a Japanese

976
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
most of those levels are made

977
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
by Japanese it's kind of cool

978
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
it's worldwide it's worldwide guys

979
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
new mystery must mystery musterim costume

980
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
cool

981
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
all right normal

982
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
so that's on normal we'll do the game on normal

983
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,000
so this one is more levels interesting interesting interesting

984
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:06,000
cool cool land

985
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:14,000
but this is where it actually is this is where it's this is where it's going to get hard probably maybe

986
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
maybe not seems pretty standard

987
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I think it fly

988
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
oh my goodness

989
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
what a troll

990
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
just go over him

991
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I knew it I knew it I knew it was going to be something in there

992
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
there's gigantic ones

993
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
can I go up I'm going to go up in the room

994
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
rain hell on them from above

995
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
at least this is like an actual level

996
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I'm going to get stuck down there if I go down there on I

997
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
this one's longer too

998
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
and there we go

999
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:33,000
so what after you do this you unlock hard is that what works

1000
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
let me listen in

1001
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
and we'll sneak my own stream

1002
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
so what after you do this you unlock hard

1003
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
how bad is the delay

1004
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I thought I had that in the fence is actually somewhat on the more nuanced side

1005
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I like look I just looked down at the chat and I was just sunk to my death oh great

1006
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:33,000
of course I wouldn't the worst one possible running into like oh I was on his head I was running his head

1007
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,000
that's baloney

1008
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:58,000
yeah I thought it's a one second delay but I thought I thought I fixed that in OBS I guess not though

1009
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
get away from me

1010
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
damn that's just making it worse

1011
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
watch out for the bullets

1012
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:23,000
actually don't even shouldn't have even gotten that mushroom just go go go go go go go go go go go go go go well you have a second oh come on

1013
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,000
fuck I have plenty of lives

1014
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I'm gonna go on the top one this time

1015
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,000
fuck I got too itchy

1016
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,000
fuck I got too itchy

1017
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:04,000
yeah because bringing in console footage it takes like three seconds or so before it actually gets to the computer

1018
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:12,000
so you end up having to go in and do all kinds of weird audio delays and I thought I ended up doing it right but apparently not

1019
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:25,000
oh boy that's that's super annoying it just launches you up you can't touch them

1020
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I'm gonna be careful here

1021
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I did it again my hand just like

1022
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I was looking to chat I shouldn't be doing that

1023
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I got plenty of lives I'm okay

1024
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I can play in fucking flappy bird

1025
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,000
no I can't sit it again

1026
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:29,000
wow I'm just gonna skip that mushroom entirely the bounce back from that mushroom ends up just launching around like a fucking pinball

1027
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:37,000
it's a good idea to get it but I think if you just try to swim through it should be okay

1028
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:51,000
well you know I'll just bait him we'll take it slow there we go come on come on over here

1029
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I love all they split into two

1030
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:15,000
damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it how come the bullets I did not know that that hit me

1031
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I did not that cake to go to know the hit detection because that was like an inch away from touching me

1032
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
unfortunately oh my god

1033
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:34,000
damn it damn it

1034
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:45,000
hundred marios 100 of them

1035
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I don't want to touch that mushroom till at least these two are gone

1036
01:07:52,000 --> 01:08:03,000
well actually hit his head I will okay good

1037
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:10,000
all right much better shaped than before

1038
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:17,000
dear

1039
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:24,000
much up for the bullet

1040
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:38,000
they really want to want you around that is that's some shit right there

1041
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:52,000
damn those shoot in a very long delay come on

1042
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:11,000
get me out of there fuck you please

1043
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:18,000
whoa whoa I did not know that happened fuck

1044
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:27,000
can't as long as the over the level hard where's the checkpoints no just wait

1045
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
don't do anything stupid you're already here those things can go through goddamn walls

1046
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:38,000
come on come on move move yes finally

1047
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:47,000
woof yeah wonder if I can let's see if I can do it from here

1048
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:54,000
let me see how many milliseconds it is

1049
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:08,000
all right I'll try something in a minute here

1050
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:17,000
once I go through this I'll try again doing different a different tactic

1051
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:26,000
don't know what this item does I didn't play this game so we're gonna figure it out right now

1052
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:33,000
to me this looks like a propeller okay that's what it does

1053
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:46,000
still floating hell am I of course

1054
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I thought I landed on them but I didn't say I just try to go too fast let's try to rush like crazy

1055
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I got to the end there I got stuck up top I didn't know the hell I was as a blue that one

1056
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:22,000
is there was just a fall fast but this or no you just always going to do that

1057
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:29,000
that's why it's dangerous to use it okay

1058
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:37,000
I think I can hit this guy when he jumps up jump up again maybe just spawned that's

1059
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:49,000
probably what happened getting too greedy with those jumps just see I was

1060
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:56,000
way further bounce back holy shit that was good thing I got hit

1061
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Mario time you can do the ground pound okay cool

1062
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Mario three

1063
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:30,000
cool we have a multi layered multi level let's go

1064
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:37,000
good feeling I'm going to have to utilize those

1065
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Beanstalk

1066
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
oh shit I should have jumped

1067
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:56,000
that's right for the fucking assholes that throw the wrenches oh come on come on now

1068
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:18,000
yeah screw you

1069
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:25,000
is that a shoe it is it's a giant it's like a high heel

1070
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:38,000
what's going on here oh that might be a mushroom it is in fact it is a mushroom

1071
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:48,000
but not a mushroom but one of these things what is happening here that's the you

1072
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:55,000
got to go there right when it ends so right

1073
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:05,000
gives a shit about coins we're trying to like me the level this is a really good

1074
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:13,000
one this is a really good this is a really dangerous one too though oh damn it I had to go up

1075
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:20,000
and around and I know I didn't what I'm invincible what am I missing here oh shit right there

1076
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:42,000
got to be getting close to the end yeah you can wear those boots yeah you can I remember that

1077
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:56,000
for next time shit go the door was right there I should have waited oh that one was tough

1078
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:07,000
that one was tough that was not that was not simple all right get it together here let's go

1079
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:20,000
who cares about the beanstalk oh you need to go on the beanstalk I think

1080
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:38,000
somebody bullets oh it wasn't up yet well that's just too bad

1081
01:15:44,000 --> 01:16:03,000
you know it's kind of deceiving the stuff like blends in with the wall I think like I can go through these sometimes but I can't let's take a shoe this time it's going to get it's going to get the killed without a doubt but this does go in the shoe this is not a good idea the shoe is a bad idea

1082
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I already don't like the idea of having to shoe on and I just crushed these things these I can step on these guys

1083
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:27,000
does it keep you protected maybe I feel maybe I feel more confident inside the shoe

1084
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:46,000
holy shit don't throw that at me getting there's even more there's more to this I don't know what enemies down there I don't know

1085
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:53,000

1086
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:06,000
right okay yeah I remember I remember these holy fucking dogs shit in my mouth okay we're good

1087

1090
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:43,000
if I just toss him down there what happens what just happened to me go get him did I get him no I didn't you just do it you break it I have 80 I've 86 seconds come on do you think

1091
01:18:43,000 --> 01:19:00,000
we break everything come on smash it all up I can't believe that happened that seriously so that's so depressing after all that that was like I

1092
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:14,000
that was a good run I actually like got through that one I was tough but I walked I like I like pain in the ass this game dude who

1093
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:23,000
have made this level props to you this is fucking awesome I got to make one of these we've

1094
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:32,000
gotten somewhat used to this weird delay I have it was definitely a terrible idea to do those very difficult levels first without

1095
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:46,000
having playing Mario for like five years shit give me the shoe give me this I'm feel a little bit safer now this time don't

1096
01:19:46,000 --> 01:20:02,000
fuck it up like a dickhead you know what a really cool part about this game really is if you're a fan of Mario games you're just

1097
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:17,000
like never ending content you can play Mario games forever easy easy now easy now

1098
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:42,000
shit let's go this time do not screw this up holy shit what the fuck oh my god hit it did I win I won

1099
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I won

1100
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I'm silent no I'm just gonna silently beat this how was I supposed to know that's what was gonna happen I didn't know there was a one

1101
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:32,000
little tiny little dickhead plant in my way and I'm getting sloppy I'm just gonna get him getting a little

1102
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:39,000
irritable I'm getting a little sloppy but who gives a fuck just go I don't even need the shoe

1103
01:21:39,000 --> 01:22:00,000
eat my fucking bottle okay what the fuck am I talking about it go I just got to be another one yes come on one of you has to have one you do

1104
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I at least I'm completing the levels right you give me some credit for that one this one I can't slow down here

1105
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:33,000
now I just go now that I know that that's there I essentially can just skip this whole thing right like if I just

1106
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:44,000
press this it just go down the tube right that's what we're doing go right down the tube you punk you fucking

1107
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:54,000
piece of shit and god I don't know what's down here don't like please don't be a whole it's over I did it

1108
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:12,000
whoo that was a good level that was very good level I commend that guy that was really really cool let's keep going

1109
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:19,000
what do you say huh

1110
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:37,000
another one of these regular new super barrio brothers we we you we I don't like this one already

1111
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:45,000
don't ask me how I'm alive from that I don't know how I stayed alive I don't I have any idea

1112
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:59,000
but is this level that you've created no you don't don't know can I not get out of here

1113
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:06,000
this dude has made a level you just get trapped inside

1114
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:18,000
okay let's let's sit here and just pray I'm just gonna wait for the chat to tell me I have to

1115
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:24,000
like press up down left right in like in like smash through yeah I just got I just got

1116
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:36,000
faded we have to restart I can't can I know I don't know I don't think you can

1117
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:51,000
crap I'm too big I'm not gonna sit here with start over just whatever I still have 92 lives this

1118
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:58,000
is not this is not going as terrible as I thought it was going to go be careful too much too much

1119
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:08,000
air now that's the mushroom I can probably get right I go down here then slowly can I make this

1120
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:18,000
jump oh eat I was trying to do the jump off that shit you know what I think they're all

1121
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:24,000
baits I I really do I think everyone of these mushrooms is a bait so we're just not we're going to ignore them

1122
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:37,000
I just squeezed my eyes closed after that how do I get that the first time

1123
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:50,000
that's about that's much safer to do it like that so if I don't get that mushroom just go over it

1124
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:57,000
try I can get that one can I can I not I get stuck in here I swear okay now I'm good

1125
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:16,000
all right let's continue on I get stuck anywhere this is such a leap of faith it's terrible

1126
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:29,000
there's no reason for me to do this no reason we're it's safe I don't know I don't I don't know how am I supposed to know

1127
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:42,000
okay I can see how do you make that jump how do you make that jump how do you make that jump how do you

1128
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:50,000
make that jump are you even supposed to feel like you're probably not even supposed to

1129
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,000
now that way is just total total death I'm not going down I'm gonna stake that would be

1130
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:10,000
spin dodge probably I think the spin dodge thing yeah that's definitely it

1131
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I can just go for up here can I look at I do it from up here I might just overshoot it I don't know

1132
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:31,000
we're okay we're fine that was a huge overshoot but I'm all right

1133
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
oh no you have to go around he did the thing that I did in my terrible shitty level

1134
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:53,000
I need to see what's down here I can stand on that but no more no further to the left

1135
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I'm gonna get his touch the plant touch the plant pot I don't care

1136
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I do have another screen to see comments unfortunately it's hard to see it because I have to look

1137
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:17,000
down on my on my iPad because I don't have really set up that well unfortunately

1138
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
but I can't yes every so often I am looking down and seeing

1139
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:34,000
almost halfway there I want to do something cool for Mario maker actual level

1140
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,000
like that could be fun oh shit I lost you what the fuck happened to me I'm really literally

1141
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:48,000
reading chat there's got high man made this oh that's what that's what killed me I lost the chat

1142
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:56,000
hold on I got a reloaded chat there it is there's the chat

1143
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:05,000
all right sit here in contemplate what's going on here

1144
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
hmm okay I understand

1145
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,000
coolest one so far that was the coolest one so far I don't care how short it was that was really

1146
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
really cool

1147
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:35,000
if that was that was that was pretty sweet too hard to is this one too hard to so this is too hard

1148
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:47,000
one apparently it's too hard this one just called level one

1149
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:56,000
so remake of the old classic classic level one that's something hidden in these some like hidden

1150
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:07,000
shit in here no all right that doesn't work that doesn't work you plumbing is all screwed up

1151
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:16,000
we're still on normal right we didn't just trek back to easy for some reason

1152
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
well nice speak so soon forget it we're just moving in the jump

1153
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
you

1154
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
got these flying things actually not out now it just got really really annoying

1155
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:54,000
oh that one that one this one's not even hard I just I missed represented where I was going to be

1156
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:03,000
following there it shouldn't have happened trick not have happened again we're just going to go

1157
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:10,000
with the jump forget about anything else I didn't I didn't want that I didn't want that I didn't

1158
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:16,000
want to pick that up I didn't want that I didn't want that I didn't want that I didn't want it

1159
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:29,000
I picked it up anyways though God this the easier level now this one's giving me the trouble for some reason

1160
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:40,000
just do the jump don't pick up the thing wait be patient wait

1161
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:53,000
actually didn't even see him go up that was dumb that was dumb that was real fucking dumb

1162
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
what's the name of this level again like hi

1163
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
so when you name your level high it means that you just like made the level in 10 seconds and you

1164
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:11,000
just testing it I'm having trouble with the fucking test level can I kill that with this I'm not

1165
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:19,000
even going to try because I don't know we're just I'm just fucking jumping over the whole damn thing

1166
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I'm jumping over the entire thing no balls yet I'm just gonna go over the whole thing

1167
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I'm not putting in those

1168
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
get that out of the way

1169
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
okay I said I was gonna do that but I lied

1170
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
oh

1171
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
thank god oh fuck

1172
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,000
my whole body hurts from that my whole body hurts

1173
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
like any more of that of that like kind of straight and I would have thrown up

1174
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:28,000
you see how he's spacing these he's spacing them ever so slightly different

1175
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
that was a nice one you almost got beat the end there

1176
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:58,000
is this the go until I throw up stream you mentioned before could be

1177
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
much how we got these fucking ground founders

1178
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
you're gonna put enemies in my way you're gonna think you're gonna you're gonna fool me with that

1179
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:15,000
not easily fooled okay thought that was gonna hit me

1180
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
well that was another one of those levels where you just kind of run forward

1181
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
you

1182
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
run for your life castle huh that is

1183
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
did you do what was that picture that face what was that big like face

1184
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I want to draw a picture like that

1185
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
don't move

1186
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
you gotta be kidding me

1187
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:54,000
you're kidding me this is I'm not moving I'm not touching anything

1188
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
oh my god that was fucking awesome

1189
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
now that's the type of stuff I like to see that was really cool

1190
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
that was awesome

1191
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
all right

1192
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:35,000
all right was this like a swear word can you get a hundred

1193
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I just did right I don't I don't know what he's asking me I'm not I don't know what he's asking me to do

1194
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
you

1195
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
going up

1196
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
can I get a hundred what coins what

1197
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
but what's that what kind of one up mushroom was that

1198
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,000
see yeah he's got something over here yeah there is something over here

1199
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I don't I can't I don't speak that language I don't know what that says

1200
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:20,000
just a secret door over there hold on there might be more things

1201
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
odd level doesn't even shoot bullets

1202
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:41,000
okay we got a shoe I think I screwed up I'm pretty sure I had to hit that

1203
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
but whatever I got the shoe

1204
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
well we'll move over here

1205
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:57,000
oh okay what's the point of that

1206
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
it's just it's it's gonna be a coin whatever let's just go

1207
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:08,000
what

1208
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,000
why did I just he just put random things in boxes

1209
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:23,000
all right let's hop skip and jump out of here fall down this hole

1210
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:29,000
let me guess there's gonna be an enemy in here

1211
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
nope oh that was oh yeah I did that whatever

1212
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:42,000
yeah that was that I that was I actually kind of liked that level it was really really odd

1213
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
it was just odd

1214
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
get them on hundred coins easy

1215
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
it was pretty easy

1216
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I don't know that that could be some type of warning I don't know what it says

1217
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
again I'm gonna assume I had to just do that

1218
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,000
whoa it's just launching around hitting everything

1219
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:20,000
yeah I should have went with it see I didn't go with it I didn't go fast enough

1220
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:27,000
to know I'm at the mercy of walking very slow slowly

1221
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,000
oh no no no no no okay oh this right in my fucking way

1222
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
okay you have to follow it I didn't know that was gonna be right the way

1223
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I'm actually still going I can still see it

1224
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
no no stop hanging on to the wall you glued to the wall

1225
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
there's just going all over the place

1226
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:11,000
so I just end up at the end I do

1227
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:21,000
so okay what happened here these levels were difficult kind of moderately hard the first like four

1228
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:29,000
and now we're getting hey watch a bunch of the turtles get hit by a shell where there's

1229
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
level 12

1230
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,000
yeah this this this looks like it's a it's like to level

1231
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
who needs it skip the whole thing

1234
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000

1237
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,000
I feel like I can just make it I think I can just make it I can make it I can just make it

1238
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:51,000
up like that how do you unlock shit like that see that's what good cool I want to like put

1239
01:40:51,000 --> 01:41:10,000
chic in my level getting close and then I'm gonna try to make a level for real a real this is just

1240
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
keep running the other one told me not to move this one's telling me to move so I'm just gonna move

1241
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
uh oh I just

1242
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:35,000
that was so many stars that was too many stars

1243
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
damn it I didn't run fast enough

1244
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
run this time don't overshoot it just wait for the cloud

1245
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I thought I missed it in fact that probably did

1246
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
you get a transfer so there's like a relay race

1247
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:24,000
what is this here for it's like watching my mom play Mario

1248
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
you

1249
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
getting closer to the last one second the last level let's go

1250
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
what was this one called I was looking down a chat who knows

1251
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
well let's go

1252
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
that doesn't hit him

1253
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
tune

1254
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
okay

1255
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
interesting

1256
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
okay not do that maybe I can be going here

1257
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I guess not

1258
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
how do I get up there

1259
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
is it supposed to take that shell or something or jump on top of it

1260
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I guess I have to take damage I guess

1261
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
so I think I don't think this is possible for me to go in here anymore

1262
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
no I can't go in here anymore I I I I I walked myself out of here

1263
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
so you know it's it's time to do

1264
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
yeah goofed it up

1265
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
I goofed it up first try the name of this one

1266
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,000
maybe I would have had that first try if I didn't I didn't fucking muck that all up

1267
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
like that I didn't even goop that all up

1268
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
get out of here oh shit

1269
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
come on I don't have time for this

1270
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
that doesn't do anything

1271
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
can run past that

1272
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
why did I freak out why did I just freak the fuck out right there

1273
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I did I didn't think I was gonna make it for some strange reason

1274
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
it's the last level and hopefully I unlock some more stuff

1275
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
the final level very cool

1276
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:25,000
what the hell is this mess of a level

1277
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I was just taking that all in what's taking that in

1278
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000

01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:59,000
this is as neck and neck as I've ever seen something like this

1302
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000

1305
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,000
expert is winning it's very very close

1306
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
expert is so lame

1307
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
well uh the the the votes are in

1308
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
all right I'll do expert until I get down to like 60 lives

1309
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:17,000
if I get down to like no we'll say 70 if I get down to 70 lives in the first like two levels

1310
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I'm just I'm just gonna make a I'm gonna make a level I'm not gonna uh

1311
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,000
I'm not gonna lose my mind tonight

1312
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
he's just gonna make levels that make himself feel good

1313
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:41,000
okay well that's it 52 to 48 that was very close though very close

1314
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:48,000
okay no game make sure expert is picked let's go

1315
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:58,000
isn't gonna suck I was getting like mad in the beginning because

1316
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:04,000
doing it with like in the first like 15 minutes of the stream I was playing very difficult levels

1317
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:10,000
at least in my opinion and I was I was not I was getting not happy at all

1318
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,000
now I'm gonna do that again sure

1319
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I was told to run so I believe that

1320
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:35,000
I'm not sure what's gonna happen here but maybe I should just follow it just run right

1321
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:42,000
I I I didn't just run I held up

1322
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I didn't I didn't just run I could have jumped over that possibly too

1323
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
oh

1324
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:13,000
holy shit what what what that was a wall of bousers oh just kill me now

1325
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:25,000
I might get there again but what you I've only died like three okay that just scribbling

1326
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:31,000
what what the fuck you just you're gonna drop down like a drop down army when I'm trying to run

1327
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:37,000
through with a run to just run level that held me up for a quarter of a second that wouldn't

1328
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:48,000
have happened whatever just run but if you just run I think I actually do have to make this

1329
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:54,000
thing nope I fucked it up we're not just running we are not just running just run huh

1330
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:00,000
what's the skeleton thing therefore then what do you got a skeleton for you want just to run

1331
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
just wait till these things are all dead and I'm just gonna go down here and just start

1332
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
this star right there this is the star there's a star give me the star

1333
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:21,000
fuck no okay I'm gonna do that same strategy same strategy I already screwed it all up

1334
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
that's over already maybe not yeah but

1335
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
did that star down there is I have to get that

1336
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:44,000
yeah that is the strategy that's the strategy I'm going with I'm gonna stick to it

1337
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
wait for all these idiots to go I forget which one was it

1338
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
I did not have a bunch of unnecessary enemies I believe it was this one

1339
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:02,000
so then I after this I can just run okay it's this one nope it's this one yep

1340
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,000
there's a spring there's a spring chill out okay I'm good

1341
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:28,000
okay good I thought that just like I thought that just killed me at the end

1342
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
that was good that was a good one

1343
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:48,000
blade jumper I love Mario 3 oh Mario 3 cool just run

1344
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
how do you even know that you can get that to happen is my question that's crazy

1345
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:04,000
people are smart

1346
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:15,000
okay easy easy I said easy I told you to be easy I told you to be easy and you freaked out

1347
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
that was so that was so easy that was the easiest thing at that whole level

1348
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
you

1349
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:32,000
get out of here yeah and your little dog too

1350
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,000
fuck it just jump over it fuck who cares jump over the whole thing

1351
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:46,000
you're over complicating things for yourself that's pretty usual

1352
01:55:51,000 --> 01:56:00,000
hey it was not you there was no reason to do that I don't believe this I don't

1353
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
believe it I don't think this is real I think it's trying to screw with me maybe not

1354
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:20,000
too much thinking then I go right through I have a lot of trouble with those because you can't

1355
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
keep moving you have to just go straight up I got it this time

1356
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:43,000
you can skip levels no we're not doing that I'm not skipping levels

1357
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:52,000
they don't drive angry never never drive angry and that's what I'm doing right now I'm time

1358
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:58,000
behind the I'm driving angry just take a deep breath okay we're good move

1359
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
fucking drive an angry don't drive angry

1360
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:26,000
not like it matters anyways this one just go just do it you see what I'm talking about

1361
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,000
you see what I'm talking about like you just like when you land on it instead of just

1362
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I can feel I can feel like my my face is heating up you know you know when you're like

1363
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,000
feel your face just heating up and you just feel them in

1364
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:53,000
somebody needs to put like a fire extinguisher into my face because it's fucking flaming right now

1365
01:57:54,000 --> 01:58:06,000
get up feel like something down there you know let me look down here no it doesn't look like it maybe

1366
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,000
there is I guess not whatever

1367
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:22,000
that was a tried and true strategy and I know no no no no no no no more talking no more excuses

1368
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:36,000
excuse us we just got so ridiculously incredibly lucky right there yeah words can't even

1369
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:44,000
describe so let's capitalize on it it's like you know sometimes why does it not just not work

1370
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:58,000
sometimes that when we get it's one inside this tube is where it's really really annoying

1371
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:17,000
ah I thought that was the end I thought that was the end I thought that was the end I was desperately

1372
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:25,000
trying to find the end there you can't be serious don't do that right when I'm near the end

1373
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:42,000
whoa there's more this even more to this fucking shit show thank goodness

1374
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:53,000
they there's always they always try to screw you at the end I know it see there was a possibility that

1375
01:59:53,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I was just gonna run straight over there there was an opportunity for me just to walk right off

1376
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:14,000
that was a good level let's go okay what I say like 60 or like 70 lives spin jump

1377
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:31,000
okay spin jump I'm assuming you had to spin jump the whole way you see how he perfectly

1378
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:40,000
lined that up to get hit right there don't ask me how I survive that what what oh my god jump

1379
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,000
this is a paper airplanes everywhere to

1380
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I'll give you a spin jump I almost just didn't do it right there

1381
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:02,000
there we go

1382
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:09,000
I gotta beat these can I jump on them yes you can

1383
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:22,000
just wait for these get the spindy little head and that's the end

1384
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
oh

1385
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:40,000

1388
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000

1390
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:13,000

1391
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:27,000
I think I think I just killed it did I did I kill it no I think we're still here right

1392
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:33,000
yeah we're here okay

1393
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
oh no I don't want to comment

1394
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:48,000
let's go I don't know what was the name of this one epic ghost house

1395
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
let me get a feel for this one

1396
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,000
that's what that's what's gonna happen

1397
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:08,000
okay like there's another one why how else would I be able to get up here

1398
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,000
did I miss something when I was like looking at stuff

1399
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
feel like I missed something maybe something flew by

1400
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I know it I know it of course of course there's gonna be that

1401
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:46,000
as far as it goes that what a dumb idea what a fucking idiot like what a fucking dumbass

1402
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,000
yes

1403
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,000
why would I why would I do something like that

1404
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
I just I just jumped off the edge in an unknown level

1405
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
what the fuck was what

1406
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:11,000
epic ghost house more like hidden blocks are going to kill you oh my god

1407
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
well don't go there

1408
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
now it's over here right

1409
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:31,000
gonna hit it again there it is no where is it

1410
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:39,000
look at how now I know now I know now I know now I know now I know what's going on I'll be okay

1411
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
I understand now

1412
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
oh I get it it's not that one it's right here

1413
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
let me took me like 75 years to figure that out now don't do that

1414
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,000
okay I was certain that I was dead there

1415
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
I

1416
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:12,000
can I get out of here okay this is this thing goes so fast

1417
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I don't know I'm just gonna do this I'm scared I don't know what's going on mom

1418
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:25,000
oh oh should I miss it I missed the boss I just missed the boss

1419
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:40,000
that is crazy that is crazy you just have to get lucky you just have to get lucky and and hope to

1420
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
God that you can make it through that

1421
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:07,000
I hit it again I hit the now I'm just none I'm getting angry again starting to get

1422
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
not happy again

1423
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,000
there's got to be a rhyme to that right there's got to be a rhyme of reason to what's going on

1424
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
there I just got to figure it out please disappear thank God

1425
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:31,000
that comes down it comes down

1426
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:41,000
they come down right there you know the really is I was gonna say slow down a little bit but no you

1427
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:46,000
just you're just gonna take that ride and hope you can jump over the stuff

1428
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:58,000
I don't know how to I don't how to avoid that it's a jump if I think it's a jump over it huh

1429
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I'm assuming you had to just jump over that because it'll just that'll

1430
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
trigger it every single time you hit by it every time

1431
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:18,000
well try to rush it

1432
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
I tried to jump I tried to jump I did you hear the button did you hear you heard the button you

1433
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
had to have heard the button I tried to jump my guy crouched

1434
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:36,000
I'll have to like sit in a certain spot on it

1435
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:42,000
and I said I could actually get back to that part rather than just like hold my eyes closed like

1436
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Mario was doing let's get right on the front oh boy that didn't work

1437
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
no oh you can't hit that guy

1438
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:06,000
shit this is a pain in the ass

1439
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:28,000
okay so if I just walk on it no oh it's just going too fast

1440
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:32,000
it's going too fast for my fucking brain to handle us

1441
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I have to jump on it and then run the underneath that thing and then not get hit by the giant

1442
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,000
flame wake at the end of it and then jump jump over the guy's head I don't even know

1443
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,000
I was not in now I'm just I'm just being a fucking dummy

1444
02:08:50,000 --> 02:09:01,000
oh only a few more tries at this and you know it's just all repetition

1445
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:07,000
after doing this like 300 times I'll probably figure it all out

1446
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
start the end walk forward I didn't do it fast enough

1447
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,000
but the hell what how did he hit me

1448
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I'm gonna take this one down to 70 and I'm just skipping it you can call me the skipper

1449
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,000
this one is crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy

1450
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
almost

1451
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:53,000
oh again it's just trial and error there was no way for me to know that that was gonna fall

1452
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:59,000
there was absolutely no conceivable way I would have known that that thing was going to fall

1453
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
and unless I died by it like I just did

1454
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:14,000
like that was just somebody just threw a fucking beer in my face now that is not a good idea

1455
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
oh

1456
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:22,000
or at least I might have this down at least this part okay I'll take don't take the hit here

1457
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,000
here it comes oh shit

1458
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,000
ah what did I do there

1459
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:43,000
I did what do I do there and I just flipped out I just got to I got to

1460
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:48,000
might be okay I still might be all right

1461
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,000
screw you boob

1462
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
oh

1463
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
oh my god I had the mobar

1464
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
I said 70 once it gets down to 70 that's when we that's what I I throw the

1465
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,000
throw the skip into this one

1466
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:28,000
at least I figured out this first part

1467
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,000
although it's so hard to even determine what time it went to leave

1468
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
I'm stuck here I'm stuck here forever

1469
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:46,000
all I can potentially do is like I don't even know I'm not even sure I'm just gonna hit

1470
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:52,000
this button just go no there was a flower down there I could possibly have gotten

1471
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,000
this is excruciating

1472
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
at least I'm not gonna hit by the first uh block guy

1473
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
okay good shit shit shit shit

1474
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:25,000
I'm gonna try to get this it's it's totally worth it or is it

1475
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:33,000
I'm I think I'm gonna trigger the the fall I kicked it I just kicked it I kicked the damn thing

1476
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:43,000
well this is where here we are

1477
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:53,000
here we are and of course of course the creator of this level made sure that if you try to

1478
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:59,000
rush this beginning you're just totally 100% going to screw yourself

1479
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
you

1480
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:13,000
got hit by the dumb easy thing that's that's gonna be it this one's done yeah

1481
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:21,000
I'm gonna you know I'm gonna try I'll try the door I'll try the door

1482
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
if the door if the door puts me the beginning of the level I'm going to skip this level I'm

1483
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,000
gonna just pull up the start menu and say get me out of here

1484
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
oh

1485
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:46,000
whoops no one in the door

1486
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,000
oh oh boy oh boy oh boy

1487
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
stay with me stay with me step what

1488
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
what the fuck no touch it I did it

1489
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
I did it thank god

1490
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:19,000
got it

1491
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:28,000
you're not only wasted like 20 lives on that one

1492
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:32,000
so it's called blowing blowing

1493
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:41,000
interesting I had to go way before that I currently did

1494
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:47,000
because now I'm just at the mercy of this

1495
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:55,000
10 that did okay go I just gotta run otherwise you just get overwhelmed actually

1496
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
might be able to get the mushroom before they all get over here

1497
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:06,000
yeah I can I definitely can I was wasn't quick enough I didn't use my quick draw showdown skills

1498
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
I would have had it if I wasn't such a fucking dumbass

1499
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
got it let's do it

1500
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
down arrow right here up arrow

1501
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:36,000
easy though I don't I don't want to get see that's why I was being easy those

1502
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
see this probably what I have to go down there what what what what what

1503
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:47,000
oh I think I got not entirely sure what's going on but I can just go in this let's hope I can

1504
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
I

1505
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:57,000
all right I'm gonna figure this out let's try this

1506
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:07,000
don't get it yet just in case something's going on over here I need to see

1507
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,000
what

1508
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,000
yes

1509
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000

02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
there we go there we go

1512
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I knew what I knew what was going to happen I knew what was going to happen I

1513
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:40,000

02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:30,000

1533
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:42,000
50 50 shot if I'm gonna hit it or not okay that well that's what's down there found what's down there

1534
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:58,000
now I'm supposed to stop doing that all right I need to stop fucking this up that would be great

1535
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:07,000
got a better idea I like this idea much better

1536
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:15,000
I I don't like this idea because I needed to keep one of those things alive

1537
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:25,000
is it even possible for me to do this kind of no holy shit

1538
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,000
just shooting up at me now

1539
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,000
oh come on the thing is about to disappear that thing was about to disappear

1540
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:52,000
that was disappearing as we spoke nope I got stuck got stuck

1541
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:23,000
oh oh oh oh oh that was that was not that was luck it's all that was

1542
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:34,000
get it do it yeah

1543
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:44,000
yeah that's what that's all that did that was the point of that okay apparently that that was

1544
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:55,000
the point of that one I don't know if I like do I just I guess I just have to I guess I

1545
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:00,000
just have to go up there this was kind of unnecessary trip I guess

1546
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:14,000
I'm not as small I can go down that room right yeah what I could shop anything

1561
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:45,000

1562
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:53,000
where I was in less I can new expert wasn't a good idea

1563
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
you

1564
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:04,000
any expert wasn't a good idea consider just made my little shitties dumb shit level

1565
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000

1566
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:21,000
what a what a good good job very good good worth

1567
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:29,000
get over here where is the cloud man over here I just want to get I just want to get a safe

1568
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,000
trip to that next area

1569
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:40,000
and then I guess like you know what hold on what's in here it's a mushroom

1570
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
but you didn't imagine it

1571
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:50,000
might have to give you a mushroom right here seems kind of like there's no reason to have it

1572
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:08,000
if I were to take a wild guess it would be something along the lines of I'll take that

1573
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:12,000
yes I would I would love one of those just break all this shit

1574
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
give me those mushrooms give me the fucking mushroom

1575
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:29,000
I want to tell you every time I say it's the last try I'm doing it every time

1576
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I say this is the last one and then I beat it

1577
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,000
casual cheap cheap

1578
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
cheap

1579
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:58,000
with the name like castle cheap cheap feel like it's not going to be the most fair of levels

1580
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:14,000
duck okay well that's that's

1581
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
holy shit

1582
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:33,000
guy don't even know I don't even know there's a lot of questions I have on this one I

1583
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:40,000
slid down its own because Mario likes to hold on to the wall in this version of the Mario games

1584
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:44,000
you need to let go Mario let go

1585
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,000
I guess you just take a look at this

1586
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,000
okay hit by the

1587
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:04,000
cheap cheap

1588
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:12,000
no you did it again don't tell me the fucking wall

1589
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:18,000
I can't touch any buttons otherwise we'll do that

1590
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
yeah

1591
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:24,000
jump

1592
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:32,000
it's such a good erratic pattern pulling those things shoot out let give me let's take one

1593
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:35,000
second here to figure out what the hell is going on here okay they jump all over the place

1594
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:43,000
I'm gonna have to do some wall jumps I don't know what's in that box but I'm scared to go

1595
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:51,000
over and try and to do it but here we go of course it's good to shoot one right there

1596
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:06,000
so that's that's like a that's the I want to troll you thing right you get hit right by right

1597
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,000
when you land it goes

1598
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:15,000
as long as I don't get hit by these things I should be okay at least somewhat okay staggered a

1599
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,000
little bit there we go

1600
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:25,000
just go do the jumps Mario please I want you to hold on to the walls this time

1601
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:37,000
I it's gonna shoot oh whoa are you serious

1602
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:43,000
what hit me is there oh the stupid piranha plan over there

1603
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:51,000
well at least I know that that first no I'm gonna hit that

1604
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:56,000
the first one is the is okay I can get that no problem now

1605
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:10,000
first one wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait second one should be able

1606
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:18,000
to have a good clear view here Mario please all right here we go

1607
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Here come the homing missiles.

1608
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,000
One end out, just go!

1609
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:35,000
And of course, the course that one piranha plant down the lower left, that didn't need

1610
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
to be there.

1611
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:44,000
That guy was just giggling to himself like, oh god.

1612
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:47,000
I lost, oh god, why is my chattel screwed up?

1613
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,000
What the fuck?

1614
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Don't stand there again.

1615
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Don't do that again.

1616
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:01,000
Please.

1617
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
I'm probably gonna run into the lives here.

1618
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:06,000
But you know whatever.

1619
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:17,000
It takes me a while, but I will beat it.

1620
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:32,000
I will beat this.

1621
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:36,000
I never played these Mario Wii U games.

1622
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:43,000
So the way that he's playing these walls, I'm trying to do it like it's a meat boy.

1623
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:46,000
There we go.

1624
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Though that was actually there, I'm pretty long time.

1625
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:53,000
Long enough I think I'm late again.

1626
02:31:53,000 --> 02:32:02,000
That second one shoots a fish face out straight ahead.

1627
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:03,000
You know what?

1628
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:04,000
No, boy.

1629
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:05,000
I don't know.

1630
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:08,000
I didn't know it was gonna come out at some point.

1631
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:11,000
It's so hard to climb that up that with those fireballs going at every second being

1632
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:14,000
shot out.

1633
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:20,000
That piranha plant is such a pain in the ass.

1634
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:25,000
If I can figure out the fucking pattern to get around that piranha plant and things should

1635
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:33,000
go way more smoothly.

1636
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Oh my god, and he didn't do the jump.

1637
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:40,000
He's paying balls.

1638
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:49,000
I'm gonna sit here.

1639
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Then I can go shoot in one of the time.

1640
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:52,000
I'm gonna go shoot three.

1641
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:53,000
There's three.

1642
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Go to billhoming missiles.

1643
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:07,000
You didn't jump off it.

1644
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:18,000
I don't like you didn't jump off that head.

1645
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:25,000
You know what?

1646
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:32,000
You gotta go quick here because you're gonna come these guys.

1647
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Yep.

1648
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:38,000
They're just so erratic.

1649
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:45,000
I should go right now.

1650
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:54,000
I don't know.

1651
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,000
What?

1652
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:56,000
What?

1653
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,000
What?

1654
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:58,000
What?

1655
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,000
What?

1656
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:00,000
What happened?

1657
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:01,000
That's a wall.

1658
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:04,000
I have to jump over the wall.

1659
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:10,000
I got right to the end there and I just had no idea what the hell that is.

1660
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:14,000
There's a wall there so you have to go over it.

1661
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:15,000
Right?

1662
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:21,000
I mean, what the hell was that?

1663
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Oh my fucking god and it didn't jump again.

1664
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Shit.

1665
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Damn it.

1666
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Once I get to that part, it really shouldn't be that difficult.

1667
02:34:50,000 --> 02:35:01,000
I just didn't know that I had to go all that far over.

1668
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Give me a mushroom.

1669
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:04,000
It's a fire flower.

1670
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
It's a fire flower.

1671
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:11,000
That might have just helped a ton.

1672
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
No, that's gonna get me killed.

1673
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Go down one of them.

1674
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:33,000
I thought that was still on his head.

1675
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:36,000
I didn't think that was a U-die position.

1676
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I thought that was still his head.

1677
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:45,000
I'm just scared when I actually get back over there because this guy is doing her.

1678
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:51,000
When I get back over there, the real just don't know where it ends.

1679
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Every time I'm gonna get hit by that thing, that's all.

1680
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
I'm really fucking scared.

1681
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Yeah, now I just get to get to the game too far over.

1682
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:29,000
I actually am enjoying this as hard on my brain as this is right now.

1683
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:32,000
It's actually still pretty fun.

1684
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:37,000
What is he doing over here? Get out of here.

1685
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Cashel cheap cheap. I'm gonna get hit by this.

1686
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
It's been too long.

1687
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:49,000
I'm getting something wrong with that, by the way.

1688
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Everything just went wrong on that one.

1689
02:36:54,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Everything just went wrong on that one.

1690
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Yeah, I need to get the fire flower.

1691
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:03,000
That is a good idea.

1692
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:06,000
I can get three hits three times.

1693
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:09,000
I'm gonna get to the end of this one.

1694
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:12,000
And something else is gonna happen.

1695
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:17,000
And then I'm gonna throw up the blood.

1696
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Fireflies in there.

1697
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
I can't get it. I'm not small.

1698
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Hit me.

1699
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Let's go.

1700
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:38,000
Oh, come on.

1701
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:41,000
I jumped off the fucking wall.

1702
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Oh my god.

1703
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:47,000
That's the worst part about games with a wall jump.

1704
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Sometimes you just stick on the corner of a wall and you're not trying to.

1705
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:54,000
And you'll just watch off.

1706
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:57,000
That happens quite frequently.

1707
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:10,000
I actually totally forgot that that's happened.

1708
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:19,000
God, he puts him in such fucking shitty places.

1709
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Each one of those piranha shooter things is in the worst possible position to play this video game.

1710
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:34,000
You're in every single jumping trajectory and every single spot where you're like supposed to stand.

1711
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:38,000
And they're firing at these erratic fucking patterns.

1712
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,000
Forget about the firefly.

1713
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:42,000
I don't need it.

1714
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:43,000
I don't need the firefly.

1715
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:49,000
What I need to do is I need to get by this without getting hit three fucking two three times.

1716
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:56,000
I'm gonna take a second of one two three gets three seconds for them to shoot that one.

1717
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:05,000
You got the asshole behind you.

1718
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Followed.

1719
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Oh, wow.

1720
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:08,000
How?

1721
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:13,000
You have to jump over one of those bullets.

1722
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Do I have to jump on a bullet?

1723
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Get one to follow me and then launch over in the jump.

1724
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:22,000
I think that's what I have to do.

1725
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:29,000
What a world.

1726
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
Salt.

1727
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Yeah, I am.

1728
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
This shit is fucking hard.

1729
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
It's all shit.

1730
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I stuck too long.

1731
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Yep.

1732
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:50,000
I mean, I'm already this like this far.

1733
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,000
I gotta try to beat it.

1734
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
I can't let this one defeat me.

1735
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:58,000
We didn't do expert to stop it like level seven.

1736
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:01,000
I did expert to beat this because I want to beat this.

1737
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
And I'm talking and nothing attention.

1738
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
I've already lost tire.

1739
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Here we go.

1740
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
This is gonna be this is the one.

1741
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:09,000
Number 33.

1742
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:10,000
That's my lucky number.

1743
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:11,000
Number 33.

1744
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Nice to call me that in high school.

1745
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Three three.

1746
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Let me show you why.

1747
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Let me show you why I got the nickname three three.

1748
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Because of that.

1749
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Show me this.

1750
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:51,000
I did the thing where I left on a fucking wall.

1751
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:56,000
I'm gonna walk again.

1752
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:01,000
I'm just impressed with a fucking chimpanzee.

1753
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:05,000
You know, high school used to call me fucking 31.

1754
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
Show you why.

1755
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:10,000
You wanna know why?

1756
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:15,000
This is why he's the copy used to this to copy a high school number 31.

1757
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:19,000
All you guys are gonna see why right now.

1758
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:20,000
That's even the principal.

1759
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
The principal was like, God damn number 31.

1760
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:23,000
You're so awesome.

1761
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:24,000
I was like, yeah, I know.

1762
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Let me show you why principal, the grubber.

1763
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Got one to do that.

1764
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:39,000
Here we go.

1765
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Can't kill those with that.

1766
02:41:49,000 --> 02:42:09,000
This is more to see what that fish was.

1767
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:27,000
I'm going to take a shower after I play this game.

1768
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Hey, you know what, these are calling back at high school.

1769
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
I don't know what to do.

1770
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
This is what I need to say about me, never.

1771
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
I said this is about 29.

1772
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Fuck!

1773
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
What they used to call me?

1774
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
Let's see this coming.

1775
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Let's see this coming back at high school.

1776
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Hey, did I ever tell you guys what they didn't used to call me when I was a nice boy?

1777
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:07,000
A number that they did not ever call me was 27.

1778
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
What a weird nickname that would be.

1779
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
A number?

1780
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
Yeah, my nickname is a number.

1781
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:17,000
No, no one ever called me that.

1782
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Why would they?

1783
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:23,000
What kind of a strange person would you have to be?

1784
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:27,000
To have that kind of a fucking stupid ass fucked up nickname.

1785
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:35,000
I don't know what happened there.

1786
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:39,000
God, this is so fucking hard.

1787
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:43,000
I just wish there wasn't any more after that debacle that is jumping over all their heads.

1788
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
There's a ton more.

1789
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:49,000
There's a ton more just like RNG after that.

1790
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:57,000
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1791
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1792
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:03,000
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1793
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Wait a minute.

1794
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Wait a minute. Do you see what he's doing?

1795
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
He's shooting the wall.

1796
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
We're going to take this to our advantage.

1797
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
That's been the biggest pain in the ass.

1798
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
Wait for the shoots.

1799
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Let's go.

1800
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:21,000
That just made everything so much easier.

1801
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Oh, please shit.

1802
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:29,000
Come on.

1803
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Why do you have to jump that fucking high?

1804
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Why?

1805
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Why?

1806
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:45,000
It's like the guy doesn't want you to beat this level.

1807
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:51,000
He's doing everything possible so you make sure you do not win.

1808
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Fuck you. Throw him at the throw.

1809
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Like a fucking grandpa level in here.

1810
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Sorry.

1811
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
I can't get a no.

1812
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:05,000
I can get this mushroom down here.

1813
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:11,000
So that was in a weird spot.

1814
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Oh, come on.

1815
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Come on now.

1816
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
God, I got a st-

1817
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:31,000
That one was doomed from the beginning.

1818
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:35,000
That was doomed from the fucking beginning.

1819
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:41,000
I think I have 500 seconds to beat this.

1820
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:45,000
See, somewhere this guy is going to watch this whole thing.

1821
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
Yeah, I did that.

1822
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:51,000
I made that.

1823
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:55,000
I'm just going to be like, dude.

1824
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:59,000
You're a jerk.

1825
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
I didn't time that one right.

1826
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1827
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:09,000
I wanted to go back and get the mushroom, but you know, whatever.

1828
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:15,000
You take away the random fish at the bottom.

1829
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:19,000
I probably would have beaten this like 25 minutes ago.

1830
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Not even choking.

1831
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:27,000
You get these fucking random ass jumpy shithead fish out of the picture.

1832
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:39,000
And you got a victory.

1833
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
It comes to fish.

1834
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Both fish.

1835
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Yeah, first one.

1836
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:59,000
It's okay, it's okay. Easy, easy, easy, easy.

1837
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
It comes to full.

1838
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Come on.

1839
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
I'm waiting for that fish.

1840
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Where's that fish that comes up here?

1841
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Does he come back?

1842
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
These waps don't, the, the, the, the, what, what are these?

1843
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:23,000
The stompers or at least they don't come back.

1844
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Fucking fish is going to shoot right over here.

1845
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Fish is going to show up.

1846
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Why did that other one go away?

1847
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:35,000
That's weird.

1848
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:45,000
Oh god, no, oh god.

1849
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Damn, I should have just jumped on the fucking first one.

1850
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
I should have just jumped on that.

1851
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Okay, when I get there, jump on the first one.

1852
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Do not go on that other one.

1853
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:05,000
You have to wait.

1854
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:09,000
I could have had that too if I just didn't make that same mistake twice.

1855
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:13,000
That's so annoying.

1856
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:21,000
You have to jump on these.

1857
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:25,000
That's, that's the ticket with that.

1858
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Hey, you had, guess what happened?

1859
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
I could have guessed what happened.

1860
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
I attached to the wall and jumped to the left.

1861
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Because I grabbed onto the wall, which is like an inch fucking thick.

1862
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:47,000
You're all sweet.

1863
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Well, I think I'm going to get it.

1864
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:55,000
If I can get back to where I was, I'm assuming that's near the end.

1865
02:49:55,000 --> 02:50:05,000
Why does that sometimes?

1866
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
It's really, really, really.

1867
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
Fucking, I want to get that.

1868
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
I need to do it.

1869
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:15,000
I'm going to wait till that whole thing cycles out of here.

1870
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Because I will run into that.

1871
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Of course.

1872
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
Okay, there's the other one.

1873
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:29,000
No, just screwed.

1874
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:33,000
Yeah, I'm screwed.

1875
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:41,000
I can't let this level beat me.

1876
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
I'm not skipping it.

1877
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Getting that far and skipping it is like, no.

1878
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:51,000
That's just like deflating a balloon and having to make that stupid fart noise.

1879
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:57,000
That's how I would feel as a person if I skipped this right now.

1880
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:05,000
No.

1881
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:09,000
Shoot it. Shoot, you stupid thing.

1882
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Oh, go ahead.

1883
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
A third one comes out.

1884
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
It's over. It's definitely done.

1885
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:21,000
Yeah. Now I can't even get past this fucking part.

1886
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Well, I might run into the lives.

1887
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:29,000
If I run into the lives, then I'm just going to go make a level.

1888
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
And not play this fucking level.

1889
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Not play these people make the levels are so hard.

1890
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:39,000
They take like a hundred attempts to beat.

1891
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
That's not going to be my level.

1892
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:47,000
My level is going to be sunshine and fucking rainbows.

1893
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:51,000
And where everybody, you just got to even beat it.

1894
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:57,000
If you try hard enough, or now I'm just talking.

1895
02:51:57,000 --> 02:52:03,000
This thing's going to kill me.

1896
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
Way too long.

1897
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:09,000
Yeah, this is pretty much done deal, I think.

1898
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:17,000
Yeah, this is my way too long.

1899
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:25,000
I would make like a joke right now, but I'm just not even close to being happy.

1900
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
I got to get like happy.

1901
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:31,000
What's some happy things we can talk about?

1902
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:35,000
Funny rabbits.

1903
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
They're pretty cool.

1904
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Just hit me. I don't give a fly shit.

1905
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:43,000
Give me the don't attach to the wall like a dumb shit face.

1906
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:46,000
God, it doesn't have to be this Mario.

1907
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
I fucking hate that mechanic.

1908
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
I fucking despise that mechanic.

1909
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:54,000
They're like, get in, get in, get in, hang on walls.

1910
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:58,000
It serves to make sure we want to fucking throw up.

1911
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:16,000
This is probably going to be the hardest one of this whole.

1912
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:22,000
All the other ones were like, this is level 6, level 7.

1913
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
The other ones were hard, but they were like,

1914
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
like, completely in like 20 or 30 attempts.

1915
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:30,000
This is still fucking doing this shit.

1916
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:34,000
This is like a 100 attempt level.

1917
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Do it, shoot it.

1918
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:48,000
Not enough air.

1919
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
I don't have any momentum either.

1920
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
This could be.

1921
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
Oh my god.

1922
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
This is the one.

1923
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
This is going to be the one.

1924
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:48,000
I don't know how many times I've been killed by latching onto the wall and trying to jump.

1925
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:52,000
This is the worst thing.

1926
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
Come on now.

1927
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Maybe I should wait for like one or two cycles for this.

1928
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Yeah.

1929
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Oh god.

1930
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
Fuck.

1931
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:48,000
I will prevail.

1932
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
I will prevail.

1933
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
Go ahead, hit me.

1934
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Oh my god.

1935
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:24,000
My hands are like sweating.

1936
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:34,000
I have sweaty ass hands.

1937
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:38,000
And that was a good run too.

1938
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:42,000
Oh my god.

1939
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
That was a good run.

1940
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:48,000
And it just got like my sweaty, sweaty ass hands.

1941
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Just like throw up all over that one.

1942
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:02,000
Oh, I don't have very many attempts left.

1943
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:22,000
I have seen the same thing so many times that like by certs who think things are blending together in my brain.

1944
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:26,000
I have seen the same thing.

1945
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:30,000
I have seen the same thing.

1946
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:34,000
What the fuck is going on?

1947
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
Why did I just do that again?

1948
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
Oh man.

1949
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:42,000
I think I'm just tired and losing it.

1950
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:46,000
Why am I over thinking that one so much?

1951
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
Oh boy.

1952
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Boy.

1953
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
Boy, oh boy.

1954
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:56,000
Oh, I was looking at chat.

1955
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Seeing the inevitable.

1956
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
Oh boy, I'm over it.

1957
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Oh boy, I'm over it.

1958
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
Oh boy, oh boy.

1959
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Oh boy, oh boy.

1960
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
Oh boy, oh boy.

1961
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
Oh boy, oh boy.

1962
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:18,000
I'm getting there more reliably, like way more reliably than I was before.

1963
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
And let's get a chill.

1964
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:24,000
Come to the other one.

1965
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
Oh, right.

1966
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
The other one.

1967
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Pull down apparently.

1968
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:38,000
I actually would rather be small here.

1969
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:42,000
I think I should actually need it to be small here.

1970
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:46,000
There was no way to go.

1971
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
Yeah, I got to be small there.

1972
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
That makes it way easier.

1973
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:54,000
But remember, a bullet bill comes down from the ceiling because, uh, because fuck you.

1974
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
That's why, like apparently, fuck me.

1975
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
That's why a bullet bill has to come down from the ceiling.

1976
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Creator of this game.

1977
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
You had to put that there.

1978
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:06,000
You could have put like a firefly.

1979
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:10,000
Thankfully, I got a bullet bill.

1980
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:14,000
Thankfully, I can get back there every pretty much every time now.

1981
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:22,000
But I don't really have very many attempts.

1982
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
No, I just fucked it all up.

1983
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:32,000
I got to wait till that hole goes all the way over.

1984
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
Shoot it. Shoot it.

1985
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,000
That's all right.

1986
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Nope. Oh, boy.

1987
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1988
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:50,000
I don't know if I'm gonna do it.

1989
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
I don't know if I'm gonna do it.

1990
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:56,000
This is like 45 lives on this level.

1991
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
You don't need to get, I need to get like the way you pro controller.

1992
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
What if it hell it is?

1993
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
Because I'm playing on the fucking brick.

1994
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:08,000
That's like already like a hindrance.

1995
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
I really wish I wasn't on this.

1996
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:24,000
I feel like I'm holding onto a handlebars on a bicycle.

1997
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
Apparently, wipe my hands down.

1998
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:32,000
Get prepared.

1999
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:36,000
I'm putting the other eye pad on the ground.

2000
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:40,000
Let's get ready.

2001
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:44,000
No, fuck. Shoot it.

2002
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:48,000
Shoot another one.

2003
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
Shoot another one.

2004
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:02,000
Oh my god.

2005
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:06,000
I didn't jump on it.

2006
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:10,000
That quarter of second delay, whatever it is from this thing.

2007
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Is really, really putting a stake in my ass.

2008
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
Big time.

2009
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
This time.

2010
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:28,000
Big time.

2011
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:32,000
The stuff like that should just never happen.

2012
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:36,000
Because of this stupid input delay.

2013
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:40,000
It's happened quite a few fucking touches.

2014
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:48,000
Like, see, I should never be missing these.

2015
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:52,000
But for some fucked up reason, it happens.

2016
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Where should I have like a 145 second input delay?

2017
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
I'm gonna cry about it.

2018
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
Let's go. Fuck it.

2019
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:12,000
There we go. I wanted to do that.

2020
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:18,000
That really is causing me so many problems though.

2021
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:22,000
If I'm going to be totally frank.

2022
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,000
Baby rage.

2023
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:38,000
Let's see the chat fill up with baby rage.

2024
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:44,000
Come on.

2025
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Stop doing that shit.

2026
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:48,000
That's the type of shit that can't happen.

2027
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:52,000
That gets me in a water trouble.

2028
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
Okay, please. Please don't do it again.

2029
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Holy shit, it almost just happened again.

2030
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:14,000
Bullapill don't even think about it.

2031
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,000
What the fuck? What?!

2032
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:30,000
Whoa! He did not do that last time.

2033
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:34,000
He did not do that last time.

2034
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:38,000
What on earth just happened?

2035
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:44,000
I have to think about this because it's right there.

2036
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
I just don't know.

2037
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
Because I can't jump over that.

2038
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
I can take the hit, but...

2039
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,000
Jump over it now, maybe.

2040
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
Gotta go now.

2041
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
Fucking fish.

2042
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:10,000
That's even more after that.

2043
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:14,000
I was 100% certain that the end was going to be right there.

2044
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:20,000
At least I just was thinking too much about it.

2045
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:24,000
Oh man, this is very, this is very, very, very, very, very.

2046
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:28,000
Because there's more for me to memorize at that.

2047
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
I have to memorize that part.

2048
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:34,000
Oh, that was just, that was just sloppy.

2049
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
Oh yeah, we're getting real sloppy.

2050
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
That came way too close.

2051
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:58,000
Regardless, I'm making a level after this.

2052
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
Fuck all this hard shit.

2053
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:06,000
Your name of your level is this level's cheap.

2054
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:10,000
How dare you?

2055
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
That's okay.

2056
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:34,000
Well, there he is.

2057
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
There he comes.

2058
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
Don't do that again.

2059
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
Why did he didn't do it this time?

2060
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
Of course he didn't.

2061
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
And now he's up here with me.

2062
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
Now he's up here with me.

2063
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
Oh, damn.

2064
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
No, I don't know.

2065
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,000
I don't know if I can do it.

2066
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
I don't know.

2067
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:08,000
I just don't know.

2068
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:12,000
Why do they have to come up and start throwing?

2069
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:16,000
That guy has done something fucking weird the last two times I've gotten there.

2070
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:20,000
First he stomps through the ground.

2071
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:24,000
And then this guy jumps up through the little platform where he lives.

2072
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
And is ready to throw an axe at him.

2073
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
And I can't think.

2074
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
Are you plummeting that you have?

2075
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,000
Not at all.

2076
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
Are you blending that?

2077
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:36,000
No.

2078
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
Get out of here.

2079
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
All you fishes, please.

2080
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,000
Please go on your Merry Way.

2081
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
Get out of here.

2082
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:56,000
Finally.

2083
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
Please go on your merry way.

2084
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:01,000
Bullet Bill is coming down here right now.

2085
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:02,000
Nice.

2086
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:07,000
I hope he doesn't do that.

2087
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:10,000
Hope he does not do that again.

2088
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:17,000
Alright, what are the weird shit that you're gonna do this time, buddy?

2089
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:24,000
Good, he didn't do anything stupidly strange this time.

2090
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:30,000
Okay.

2091
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,000
Alright.

2092
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:34,000
I just don't know what happens over here.

2093
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:37,000
Wait for them to get by.

2094
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:38,000
I have a second.

2095
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:41,000
There's a thing to jump on.

2096
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:45,000
Do I have an momentum?

2097
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:46,000
Not sure.

2098
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:48,000
Nothing else is gonna jump up at me.

2099
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:51,000
I've gone past that point.

2100
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:57,000
Except for those.

2101
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:58,000
Mushroom.

2102
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
Give it to me.

2103
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:05,000
Don't know what's over here, but I have to jump off this guy.

2104
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:07,000
Gotta be fucking kidding me.

2105
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:08,000
That's it right there.

2106
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:09,000
That's the end.

2107
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:13,000
I apparently didn't have enough speed.

2108
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:16,000
That's literally the end right there too.

2109
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:17,000
There's a Bowser there.

2110
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:20,000
Who knows what kind of fucked up Bowser's gonna be over there.

2111
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:27,000
I'm like five of them.

2112
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:32,000
Oh, down to the final three attempts.

2113
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:37,000
I hope you're enjoying this.

2114
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:41,000
I hope it's at least entertaining to watch me fail at this level.

2115
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:48,000
Like literally 52 times.

2116
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:50,000
Hey, I did it again.

2117
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:51,000
Get back to square one.

2118
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:52,000
Square one.

2119
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:53,000
Square one.

2120
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:54,000
Easy.

2121
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:56,000
Slow it down.

2122
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:57,000
Slow it down.

2123
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:59,000
Oh god.

2124
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:01,000
They've already moved over here.

2125
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
Yeah, this is toast.

2126
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:05,000
This is toast.

2127
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:09,000
Unless I can come up with a miracle jump here.

2128
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:12,000
That is what I would consider a miracle jump.

2129
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:17,000
That was a miracle jump.

2130
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:24,000
Miracles have seriously been witnessed.

2131
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:32,000
I'm glad everyone said they pray as this evening.

2132
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:38,000
Because that was okay.

2133
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:41,000
No, he's up here again.

2134
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
He can't even throw that far.

2135
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:44,000
He can't.

2136
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:47,000
He can do that.

2137
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:52,000
He can do that though.

2138
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:54,000
We're gonna go slow again.

2139
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:55,000
That's the lie.

2140
03:09:55,000 --> 03:10:00,000
I want to try to get two hits here.

2141
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:05,000
There's another big fat fish.

2142
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:11,000
Alright, let's do it.

2143
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:12,000
Damn it.

2144
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:21,000
I got a way to use that the peak of his jump.

2145
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:22,000
Oh my god.

2146
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:23,000
There's a wall.

2147
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:24,000
There's a wall.

2148
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:25,000
He put a fucking wall.

2149
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:26,000
He put a fucking wall.

2150
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:27,000
He put a wall.

2151
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:30,000
This guy put a fucking wall up.

2152
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:32,000
I just threw my app as on the ground.

2153
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:33,000
I don't even know.

2154
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:34,000
The guy put a wall up.

2155
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:35,000
There's a wall there.

2156
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:36,000
That was the end.

2157
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:37,000
I beat it.

2158
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:38,000
I beat it.

2159
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:39,000
I beat the level.

2160
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:40,000
I beat it.

2161
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:41,000
I beat it.

2162
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:42,000
I beat it.

2163
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:43,000
That was it.

2164
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:44,000
I won.

2165
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:45,000
I won.

2166
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:47,000
I'm trying to run by Bowser.

2167
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:48,000
Everybody knows that fucking Bowser.

2168
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:51,000
Bowser is like, you can do that.

2169
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:54,000
Everybody knows that that's what happens.

2170
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:55,000
You run by by by.

2171
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:56,000
You touch the thing.

2172
03:10:56,000 --> 03:11:00,000
That's what every single one of these levels has been.

2173
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:07,000
Every single one of these levels has, dude, puts a wall up.

2174
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,000
Dude puts a wall up right there.

2175
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:15,000
Just in case you have trouble with this level and you're trying to get, you do the big jump

2176
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:16,000
and you're gonna be it.

2177
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:18,000
Yeah, put a giant red wall.

2178
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:20,000
So I have to jump way over it.

2179
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:21,000
I don't even know.

2180
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:22,000
I can't even normally jump over that wall.

2181
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:24,000
I think I have to go over the top.

2182
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:28,000
That's the last level.

2183
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:31,000
The last life.

2184
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:35,000
I've just drained my ability to even pretend to play this game.

2185
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:37,000
I just want to make the end level.

2186
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:38,000
I just want to relax.

2187
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,000
I'm going to fucking Mario level.

2188
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:41,000
Where's the camera?

2189
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:44,000
Camera, where are you?

2190
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:51,000
Stuff the camera up your ass.

2191
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:55,000
Dude puts a wall up.

2192
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:58,000
And now there's a bull.

2193
03:11:58,000 --> 03:11:59,000
I just care to take.

2194
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,000
I couldn't get it.

2195
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:02,000
I couldn't fucking.

2196
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:04,000
Dude puts a fucking wall up.

2197
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:07,000
It's a big red wall behind it.

2198
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:10,000
No, it's just that.

2199
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:12,000
It was that guy's level.

2200
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:14,000
I'm gonna write something on that.

2201
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:15,000
I'm gonna do it.

2202
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:17,000
I'm gonna write dude puts a fucking wall up.

2203
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:20,000
I don't even think I can do it.

2204
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:39,000
I'm addicted.

2205
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:43,000
I'm gonna like to do it again.

2206
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:46,000
Yeah.

2207
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:47,000
Yeah.

2208
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:50,000
I got something for you.

2209
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:55,000
How do I write something?

2210
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:58,000
Zero.

2211
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:05,000
That's the seventh person to play this.

2212
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:10,000
How do I say something?

2213
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:13,000
I'm just gonna draw.

2214
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:16,000
I'm gonna draw.

2215
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:20,000
I'm gonna draw.

2216
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:23,000
I'm gonna draw.

2217
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:26,000
I'm gonna draw.

2218
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:28,000
I'm just gonna draw.

2219
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:30,000
I'm gonna draw.

2220
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:33,000
I'm gonna draw.

2221
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:36,000
I'm gonna draw.

2222
03:13:36,000 --> 03:13:38,000
I'm gonna draw.

2223
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:41,000
I'm gonna draw.

2224
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:44,000
I need to download that one.

2225
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:46,000
What does that thing go?

2226
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:48,000
I gave it an attempt.

2227
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:51,000
I gave it my best effort.

2228
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:53,000
Wait, nobody has beaten this.

2229
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
Is that what that means?

2230
03:13:56,000 --> 03:13:58,000
Oh, that would have been so...

2231
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:01,000
Oh, man.

2232
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:04,000
That would have been cool if I was like the first dude to clear that.

2233
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:07,000
I'm so depressed.

2234
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:09,000
I'm just depressed right now.

2235
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:11,000
Like, I beat it.

2236
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:13,000
You saw me win.

2237
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:14,000
The axe was right there.

2238
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:16,000
I touched the axe.

2239
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:19,000
I beat that level.

2240
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:22,000
I mean, it'd be one thing if I kept dying at like the first part.

2241
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:29,000
I got to the end, right?

2242
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:31,000
Man.

2243
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:34,000
I hope it was entertaining.

2244
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:36,000
That's all I care about.

2245
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:40,000
And writing a bunch of fucking swears on this guy's thing.

2246
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:43,000
But I don't know how to do that.

2247
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:46,000
Okay, like, band from Nintendo.

2248
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:48,000
I was gonna like draw like a picture of you.

2249
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:49,000
Like, fuck you.

2250
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:51,000
You're a level of fucking sucks.

2251
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:56,000
And then I'm gonna get like a permaband from Nintendo.

2252
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:58,000
Let's go to the main menu.

2253
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:00,000
Let's make it, I'm just gonna chill.

2254
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:01,000
Just relax.

2255
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:03,000
Let's make it, let's make it course.

2256
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:06,000
I'm just gonna relax.

2257
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:09,000
No, there's no reason to freak out about stuff like that.

2258
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:10,000
Look at the mile level.

2259
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:13,000
Let's go over mile level one more time.

2260
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:14,000
Right here.

2261
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:15,000
You start, you fall down.

2262
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:17,000
Whoa, are you gonna make it or not?

2263
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:19,000
Maybe you will.

2264
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:22,000
Look at this, this is just good old fashioned Mario fun.

2265
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:24,000
Where there's mushroom city.

2266
03:15:24,000 --> 03:15:27,000
Let me see, this is fun.

2267
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:29,000
Let's expand on this.

2268
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:33,000
I'm gonna start a new one.

2269
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:36,000
Remember the time, German, was the first one to beat this level.

2270
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:43,000
It was awesome.

2271
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:46,000
Oh god.

2272
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:49,000
No, he just, he just have no fulfillment.

2273
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:55,000
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just fulfillmentless right now.

2274
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:57,000
My little dog, you know what?

2275
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,000
I don't, give me that.

2276
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,000
Hey, good dog.

2277
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:06,000
Otto will make me feel better.

2278
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:13,000
So let's, I threw my stylus somewhere in that in the mayhem of me complaining about that level.

2279
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:16,000
I don't know where it went.

2280
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:19,000
We find this shit.

2281
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:31,000
I don't really thought it was gonna be, I'm not really thought.

2282
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:34,000
I haven't even eaten, I've, she's in crackers over here.

2283
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:37,000
I haven't even like eaten one of them.

2284
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:42,000
As far as it beat that Mario level.

2285
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:43,000
We're gonna shake this up.

2286
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:46,000
We're gonna make a weird level.

2287
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:48,000
So.

2288
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:49,000
I can find the stylus.

2289
03:16:49,000 --> 03:16:51,000
Is this gonna get me bangry too?

2290
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:52,000
Where's the stylus?

2291
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:53,000
Where's the god-have stylus?

2292
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:54,000
You're gonna lose the stylus?

2293
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:56,000
Where's the god-have stylus?

2294
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:58,000
Really though?

2295
03:16:58,000 --> 03:17:00,000
Where's the, oh.

2296
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:02,000
It's in my crotch.

2297
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:06,000
It's in the fly of my zipper here.

2298
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:08,000
Found it.

2299
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:11,000
All right, let me put my feet up.

2300
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:14,000
I'm gonna put my chair back a little bit in this.

2301
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:15,000
Let's just hang out.

2302
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:18,000
Just you, me, Mario Maker.

2303
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:20,000
See Mario right there?

2304
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:22,000
Gonna be making a couple of things.

2305
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:27,000
You're gonna be doing an underground level tonight.

2306
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:29,000
Gonna put some of these.

2307
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:30,000
Put some walls up here.

2308
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:33,000
This is gonna be a very linear level.

2309
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:34,000
Let's go up here.

2310
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:37,000
Wait, is that really my hand?

2311
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:40,000
Look at, that's my hand.

2312
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:42,000
I didn't even see that before.

2313
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:45,000
I was so locked in.

2314
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:47,000
I really thought that was my hand.

2315
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:58,000
I fucking for real thought that was my hand.

2316
03:17:58,000 --> 03:18:00,000
It looks like my hand.

2317
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:04,000
I swear to god, that's my hand on the screen.

2318
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:07,000
God, what kind of like drugs am I on right now?

2319
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:14,000
Let's reset them.

2320
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:22,000
The one that I think about is like, why?

2321
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:32,000
There's no camera pointing down from the ceiling.

2322
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:34,000
Okay, she gets herself together.

2323
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:39,000
She.

2324
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:41,000
Looks like my fucking hand.

2325
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:47,000
That's my hand.

2326
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:50,000
Alright, we're gonna make this, put this here.

2327
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:52,000
Why is it on the screen?

2328
03:18:52,000 --> 03:18:53,000
Why?

2329
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:54,000
Nintendo love all things.

2330
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:56,000
Why is there a fucking hand?

2331
03:18:56,000 --> 03:18:59,000
A human hand.

2332
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:03,000
I just admit this.

2333
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:05,000
Like that.

2334
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:08,000
You guys have no idea how much I freak the fuck out.

2335
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:10,000
Because you're my peripheral vision.

2336
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:13,000
Saw that on my big screen up here.

2337
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:15,000
Geez.

2338
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:16,000
It's spooky.

2339
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:19,000
Alright, I want this to be, I want, first of all,

2340
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:22,000
I want, I want, I want, we want to be able to troll about this, you know.

2341
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:26,000
I need to get the run through.

2342
03:19:26,000 --> 03:19:28,000
Delete some of that.

2343
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:30,000
I'm strapped now, iPad.

2344
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:33,000
That would be great.

2345
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:34,000
Oh, I got new stuff.

2346
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:37,000
Where's my new stuff?

2347
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:40,000
New stuff.

2348
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:42,000
Ooh, I do have new stuff.

2349
03:19:42,000 --> 03:19:47,000
Look at all this shit that I don't have.

2350
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:53,000
Let's clean that up.

2351
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:57,000
Okay, so we're gonna keep that going.

2352
03:19:57,000 --> 03:20:00,000
We're gonna do one, one, two.

2353
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:03,000
One, two.

2354
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:07,000
One, two, one.

2355
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:09,000
Two, one.

2356
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:11,000
Yeah.

2357
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:12,000
Oh, it's sad.

2358
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:17,000
It's just give-y-sac-y.

2359
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:22,000
So they're gonna start the level off, and we're gonna have to run for a little bit.

2360
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:25,000
We'll put, we'll make things a little bit dangerous, you know.

2361
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:33,000
If you want, if you want to try to get that, you're all, you know, you're all, you can get it if you want.

2362
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:36,000
Although I think I'm pretty sure that's impossible.

2363
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:39,000
That's not possible to get this, right?

2364
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:44,000
No, it is, it is, it's very possible.

2365
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:47,000
Well, you can change the hand model in the settings, you can get it, let's take a look.

2366
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:51,000
I need to see that.

2367
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:54,000
Gamepad 3D Audio, notice the case course, controls.

2368
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:57,000
Where is it?

2369
03:20:57,000 --> 03:21:03,000
That'll see it.

2370
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:06,000
Whatever.

2371
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:08,000
Alright, so that is getable.

2372
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:09,000
Let's do it.

2373
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:11,000
We'll put a mushroom in there.

2374
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:20,000
It's gonna be real dangerous, but if you're able to get there, then, you know, good for you.

2375
03:21:20,000 --> 03:21:25,000
Press stick.

2376
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:33,000
I don't fucking even know what's happening in my life.

2377
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:36,000
What do I want next?

2378
03:21:36,000 --> 03:21:39,000
Maybe I should put something to jump over.

2379
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:47,000
Yeah, you're gonna have to do some jumping here.

2380
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:50,000
Maybe another, maybe like that.

2381
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:51,000
Can you get over there?

2382
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:53,000
Is that possible to go over there?

2383
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:55,000
I like how you can just test it immediately.

2384
03:21:55,000 --> 03:21:59,000
That's awesome.

2385
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:08,000
Oh, you mean like the thumb sticks, okay, I getcha.

2386
03:22:08,000 --> 03:22:13,000
Yeah, I'm dumb chump, I'm immersed in my video game.

2387
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:16,000
Yeah, that's real dangerous.

2388
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:19,000
Good.

2389
03:22:19,000 --> 03:22:22,000
I wonder if you can even get over this.

2390
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:25,000
Can I even beat my own level?

2391
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:28,000
Probably not.

2392
03:22:28,000 --> 03:22:30,000
Yeah, you can get over that.

2393
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:33,000
Very nice.

2394
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:36,000
Click the gamepad stick.

2395
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:39,000
Hey, look at that.

2396
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:42,000
Oh, what?

2397
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:54,000
What else is there?

2398
03:22:54,000 --> 03:22:58,000
Cat ball.

2399
03:22:58,000 --> 03:23:07,000
Only Nintendo would do something like that.

2400
03:23:08,000 --> 03:23:16,000
All right, let me go back to this.

2401
03:23:16,000 --> 03:23:18,000
Okay, we're gonna put a secret.

2402
03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:20,000
Right at the, don't tell anybody.

2403
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:24,000
But right at the beginning of the level.

2404
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:27,000
You can go up here.

2405
03:23:27,000 --> 03:23:31,000
And there's gonna be a bunch of secret shit up here.

2406
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:35,000
You know, you're gonna win the game if you come up here.

2407
03:23:35,000 --> 03:23:43,000
Yeah, like here already.

2408
03:23:43,000 --> 03:23:47,000
This is just gonna be a straight line to the pull.

2409
03:23:47,000 --> 03:23:58,000
That you'll never know unless you were watching this stream.

2410
03:23:58,000 --> 03:24:01,000
Yeah, that's Mario's hand.

2411
03:24:01,000 --> 03:24:08,000
That was in trouble right now.

2412
03:24:08,000 --> 03:24:11,000
So see, it's a guaranteed win.

2413
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:21,000
There you go, guaranteed win.

2414
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:31,000
Get rid of that.

2415
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:37,000
I'm gonna put this higher.

2416
03:24:37,000 --> 03:24:44,000
Let's put it here.

2417
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:47,000
Is that like just out of reach?

2418
03:24:48,000 --> 03:24:50,000
Let's find out.

2419
03:24:50,000 --> 03:24:53,000
Let's find out.

2420
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:56,000
It is just real average.

2421
03:24:56,000 --> 03:24:57,000
That's so obvious.

2422
03:24:57,000 --> 03:24:58,000
That is so obvious.

2423
03:24:58,000 --> 03:24:59,000
Looks crap in that.

2424
03:24:59,000 --> 03:25:01,000
That is like the easiest thing I've ever seen.

2425
03:25:01,000 --> 03:25:03,000
It's so obvious.

2426
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:04,000
Look, keep it there.

2427
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:05,000
It's right now though.

2428
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:08,000
Just because it decided to go against it.

2429
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:10,000
Okay.

2430
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:13,000
Let's put.

2431
03:25:13,000 --> 03:25:19,000
I'm gonna have some coins.

2432
03:25:19,000 --> 03:25:25,000
Three, two, three.

2433
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:29,000
What does this little shithead do again?

2434
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:38,000
How bad.

2435
03:25:38,000 --> 03:25:41,000
How hard is this jump?

2436
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:52,000
You slip around a little bit.

2437
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:55,000
Yeah, you can do it.

2438
03:25:55,000 --> 03:25:58,000
It's doable.

2439
03:25:58,000 --> 03:26:00,000
No hidden blocks.

2440
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:02,000
No, no hidden blocks.

2441
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:06,000
I want you to think they're hidden blocks.

2442
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:07,000
Okay.

2443
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:11,000
Danger mushroom right there.

2444
03:26:11,000 --> 03:26:12,000
Dangerous.

2445
03:26:12,000 --> 03:26:14,000
Wait, under.

2446
03:26:14,000 --> 03:26:16,000
No redo.

2447
03:26:16,000 --> 03:26:19,000
There is no redo.

2448
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:23,000
Oops.

2449
03:26:23,000 --> 03:26:25,000
Okay.

2450
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:31,000
Now I need to have like somewhat of a normal little bit here.

2451
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:34,000
Maybe one, maybe one more like jump.

2452
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:38,000
That's really annoying to do.

2453
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:41,000
And then we take this.

2454
03:26:41,000 --> 03:26:48,000
Oh, the way like that.

2455
03:26:48,000 --> 03:26:52,000
Up with it.

2456
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:59,000
This.

2457
03:26:59,000 --> 03:27:03,000
I'm gonna do the thing where it's levels over, but.

2458
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:09,000
That's what I'm gonna do.

2459
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:19,000
That's what I'm gonna do.

2460
03:27:19,000 --> 03:27:26,000
I'm gonna do it.

2461
03:27:26,000 --> 03:27:36,000
Replace these with this to make it so much more obvious that it's the end of the level.

2462
03:27:36,000 --> 03:27:44,000
Fix that in a second.

2463
03:27:44,000 --> 03:27:47,000
There we are.

2464
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:50,000
Just like that.

2465
03:27:50,000 --> 03:27:53,000
Oh, what a doozy.

2466
03:27:53,000 --> 03:27:54,000
What a doozy.

2467
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:57,000
Do you see this doozy?

2468
03:27:57,000 --> 03:28:00,000
You know what?

2469
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:01,000
I'll put this one.

2470
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:04,000
You can't beat my level.

2471
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:06,000
This is the end.

2472
03:28:06,000 --> 03:28:07,000
Just kidding.

2473
03:28:07,000 --> 03:28:09,000
You got to break this.

2474
03:28:09,000 --> 03:28:10,000
Oh, wow.

2475
03:28:10,000 --> 03:28:12,000
What are you gonna talk about?

2476
03:28:12,000 --> 03:28:16,000
A crazy twist.

2477
03:28:16,000 --> 03:28:19,000
I'm gonna get the twist right here, guys.

2478
03:28:19,000 --> 03:28:22,000
Gotta get that mushroom back here.

2479
03:28:22,000 --> 03:28:25,000
I really think you're gonna be able to get that mushroom.

2480
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:27,000
Otherwise, you're a toast.

2481
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:30,000
You gonna do it again?

2482
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:39,000
Got the mushroom.

2483
03:28:39,000 --> 03:28:41,000
Pretty hard.

2484
03:28:41,000 --> 03:28:42,000
Pretty difficult.

2485
03:28:42,000 --> 03:28:45,000
Let's try it again.

2486
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:47,000
It's not quite there yet, but...

2487
03:28:47,000 --> 03:28:49,000
See, I know the secret to that one because I made it.

2488
03:28:49,000 --> 03:28:58,000
I'm the creator of this level, so I know all the secrets and nuances and how everything works.

2489
03:28:58,000 --> 03:28:59,000
See, you get to here.

2490
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:00,000
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

2491
03:29:00,000 --> 03:29:01,000
Oh, don't worry.

2492
03:29:01,000 --> 03:29:02,000
You're good.

2493
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:08,000
Next part of the level.

2494
03:29:08,000 --> 03:29:14,000
Just to be a real prick about things.

2495
03:29:14,000 --> 03:29:17,000
Just to make sure you don't...

2496
03:29:17,000 --> 03:29:24,000
You don't have chance.

2497
03:29:24,000 --> 03:29:29,000
I wish I had more stuff.

2498
03:29:29,000 --> 03:29:31,000
Okay.

2499
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:38,000
Put a couple of these here.

2500
03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:41,000
Yeah, why not?

2501
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:46,000
This is where it gets dangerous.

2502
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:49,000
Oh, that's not the end.

2503
03:29:49,000 --> 03:29:50,000
A little bit more.

2504
03:29:50,000 --> 03:29:53,000
Not that much, but...

2505
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:56,000
Well, he sure got me.

2506
03:29:56,000 --> 03:30:04,000
Didn't I do it?

2507
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:09,000
So now we're gonna put the one here.

2508
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:13,000
Can you mess with the timers on these things?

2509
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:16,000
Can I determine when this is gonna pop up?

2510
03:30:16,000 --> 03:30:20,000
What the fuck just happened?

2511
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:25,000
What's going on?

2512
03:30:25,000 --> 03:30:30,000
My battery died on my Wii U gamepad.

2513
03:30:30,000 --> 03:30:32,000
I can't say I don't know what's happening.

2514
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:37,000
Hold on, let me plug it in.

2515
03:30:37,000 --> 03:30:44,000
Hold on.

2516
03:30:44,000 --> 03:30:46,000
This thing died.

2517
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:47,000
I wonder why it died.

2518
03:30:47,000 --> 03:30:55,000
Maybe because I played like an hour and ten minutes on the same level.

2519
03:30:55,000 --> 03:30:58,000
Um.

2520
03:30:58,000 --> 03:31:01,000
Can I do it with a Wii U?

2521
03:31:01,000 --> 03:31:04,000
If I can just do it like this, I don't care.

2522
03:31:04,000 --> 03:31:07,000
Nope, I cannot.

2523
03:31:07,000 --> 03:31:16,000
I can move them around, but I can't actually use the Wii U.

2524
03:31:16,000 --> 03:31:19,000
Let me just plug it in.

2525
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:22,000
One second, guys.

2526
03:31:22,000 --> 03:31:27,000
One second.

2527
03:31:27,000 --> 03:31:34,000
Oh.

2528
03:31:34,000 --> 03:31:41,000
Oh, hell.

2529
03:31:41,000 --> 03:31:48,000
What's that?

2530
03:31:48,000 --> 03:31:56,000
What's that?

2531
03:31:56,000 --> 03:31:59,000
Wii U gamepad.

2532
03:31:59,000 --> 03:32:04,000
I'm not a battery life.

2533
03:32:04,000 --> 03:32:10,000
Oh.

2534
03:32:10,000 --> 03:32:14,000
Do I have an open outlet I can put this in?

2535
03:32:14,000 --> 03:32:20,000
Oh, so otherwise...

2536
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:24,000
I might have to just play more levels because that's how I can really do.

2537
03:32:24,000 --> 03:32:30,000
I'm not a gamepad.

2538
03:32:30,000 --> 03:32:34,000
What a great stream that's going on right now.

2539
03:32:34,000 --> 03:32:41,000
You got a guy that doesn't even charge his batteries on his Wii U gamepad.

2540
03:32:41,000 --> 03:32:47,000
I'd like to punch that guy in his face.

2541
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:51,000
Alright, we got some juice.

2542
03:32:51,000 --> 03:32:58,000
I turn it back on.

2543
03:32:58,000 --> 03:33:02,000
Uh, go ahead.

2544
03:33:02,000 --> 03:33:06,000
Hey, we have life.

2545
03:33:06,000 --> 03:33:09,000
Look at that.

2546
03:33:09,000 --> 03:33:12,000
Now I can move.

2547
03:33:12,000 --> 03:33:19,000
What's my question was, can you determine the timers on these guys?

2548
03:33:19,000 --> 03:33:26,000
Notification settings, manual.

2549
03:33:26,000 --> 03:33:29,000
Maybe not.

2550
03:33:29,000 --> 03:33:30,000
Can you?

2551
03:33:30,000 --> 03:33:40,000
Let me get my second iPad to see what people are saying.

2552
03:33:40,000 --> 03:33:47,000
Stick a fucking outlet, please.

2553
03:33:47,000 --> 03:33:58,000
Alright, let's do it.

2554
03:33:58,000 --> 03:34:05,000
A couple more of those.

2555
03:34:05,000 --> 03:34:08,000
I put way too much orange juice on this gamepad.

2556
03:34:08,000 --> 03:34:11,000
I probably shouldn't have tried to pour orange juice on my gamepad.

2557
03:34:11,000 --> 03:34:22,000
That probably would have helped.

2558
03:34:22,000 --> 03:34:23,000
I don't even win.

2559
03:34:23,000 --> 03:34:34,000
This one will just be sitting there.

2560
03:34:34,000 --> 03:34:37,000
Move this one down so you think you're safe.

2561
03:34:37,000 --> 03:34:44,000
But you just have no idea.

2562
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:48,000
Too much.

2563
03:34:48,000 --> 03:34:53,000
Oh, what it could do is, you know what, you're just safe.

2564
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:56,000
No, no, no, no, hold on, hold on a second.

2565
03:34:56,000 --> 03:35:00,000
Hold on just for one second here, man.

2566
03:35:00,000 --> 03:35:04,000
You think you died when you fell?

2567
03:35:05,000 --> 03:35:13,000
We give people second chances here.

2568
03:35:13,000 --> 03:35:16,000
That comes up like this.

2569
03:35:16,000 --> 03:35:23,000
But because you got a second chance, you're going to deal with all this shit.

2570
03:35:23,000 --> 03:35:32,000
You do get a second chance, but you better make a count.

2571
03:35:32,000 --> 03:35:35,000
How noticeable is that?

2572
03:35:35,000 --> 03:35:38,000
Is that really noticeable?

2573
03:35:38,000 --> 03:35:41,000
Let's find out.

2574
03:35:41,000 --> 03:35:44,000
Let's go.

2575
03:35:44,000 --> 03:35:46,000
I'm not going to move this.

2576
03:35:46,000 --> 03:35:47,000
Alright, let's do it.

2577
03:35:47,000 --> 03:35:49,000
Let's see what happens here.

2578
03:35:49,000 --> 03:35:51,000
So they are random.

2579
03:35:51,000 --> 03:35:53,000
Kind of, right?

2580
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:56,000
Where did this one go?

2581
03:35:56,000 --> 03:36:00,000
Let's go with the mod.

2582
03:36:00,000 --> 03:36:05,000
No, you can see them.

2583
03:36:05,000 --> 03:36:12,000
I'm going to take away the wings.

2584
03:36:12,000 --> 03:36:17,000
I think if the wings are, so no.

2585
03:36:17,000 --> 03:36:21,000
They probably wings are.

2586
03:36:21,000 --> 03:36:32,000
If anybody have wings, this boom is got wings.

2587
03:36:32,000 --> 03:36:36,000
Okay, now you shouldn't be able to see them.

2588
03:36:36,000 --> 03:36:41,000
Wow, real exciting stuff.

2589
03:36:41,000 --> 03:36:48,000
Can you still see them?

2590
03:36:48,000 --> 03:36:51,000
Move those up a little.

2591
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:57,000
Just in case.

2592
03:36:57,000 --> 03:37:02,000
Alright.

2593
03:37:02,000 --> 03:37:07,000
This is going to lead up to here.

2594
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:10,000
There are a bunch of coins.

2595
03:37:10,000 --> 03:37:12,000
If you made it this far, congratulations.

2596
03:37:12,000 --> 03:37:17,000
Here are some coins.

2597
03:37:18,000 --> 03:37:24,000
You win.

2598
03:37:24,000 --> 03:37:32,000
And then if you can see up here, there's going to be...

2599
03:37:32,000 --> 03:37:35,000
Smiley stones.

2600
03:37:35,000 --> 03:37:36,000
Let's try it.

2601
03:37:36,000 --> 03:37:37,000
Let's just take a look.

2602
03:37:37,000 --> 03:37:44,000
Take a gander at it.

2603
03:37:44,000 --> 03:37:49,000
Alright.

2604
03:37:49,000 --> 03:37:56,000
Play.

2605
03:37:56,000 --> 03:38:03,000
It's kind of no reason for the mushroom.

2606
03:38:03,000 --> 03:38:05,000
I broke the room.

2607
03:38:05,000 --> 03:38:07,000
What the...oh boy.

2608
03:38:07,000 --> 03:38:08,000
Oh, I can't do it now.

2609
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:10,000
I can't beat the level.

2610
03:38:10,000 --> 03:38:13,000
That's when you go, what the hell?

2611
03:38:13,000 --> 03:38:20,000
What a dick.

2612
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:25,000
Start.

2613
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:28,000
Whoops.

2614
03:38:28,000 --> 03:38:34,000
Whoops.

2615
03:38:34,000 --> 03:38:44,000
Knicks ago.

2616
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:46,000
The reason for the coins either at this point.

2617
03:38:46,000 --> 03:38:48,000
And you can just walk over that.

2618
03:38:48,000 --> 03:38:52,000
I just realized.

2619
03:38:52,000 --> 03:38:56,000
Made it through Phase 1.

2620
03:38:56,000 --> 03:38:58,000
Oh, Phase 2.

2621
03:38:58,000 --> 03:39:01,000
Oh no.

2622
03:39:01,000 --> 03:39:03,000
I made it to the end.

2623
03:39:03,000 --> 03:39:05,000
I win.

2624
03:39:05,000 --> 03:39:06,000
Holy shit.

2625
03:39:06,000 --> 03:39:13,000
That was kind of a hard jump.

2626
03:39:13,000 --> 03:39:16,000
Let's make the mushroom impossible to get.

2627
03:39:16,000 --> 03:39:17,000
Let's be real mean.

2628
03:39:17,000 --> 03:39:23,000
Let's be real mean about it.

2629
03:39:23,000 --> 03:39:30,000
Maybe she should just be right there.

2630
03:39:30,000 --> 03:39:33,000
What does the sound effects for you?

2631
03:39:33,000 --> 03:39:40,000
What is going on in the background there?

2632
03:39:40,000 --> 03:39:49,000
How do I make that so it's harder to get?

2633
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:57,000
Hmm.

2634
03:39:57,000 --> 03:40:04,000
Maybe.

2635
03:40:04,000 --> 03:40:10,000
Let's see.

2636
03:40:10,000 --> 03:40:18,000
That's a little bit harder.

2637
03:40:18,000 --> 03:40:26,000
That was a really weird mushroom.

2638
03:40:26,000 --> 03:40:29,000
I'm going to get rid of this too.

2639
03:40:29,000 --> 03:40:38,000
So you're going to get that mid jump.

2640
03:40:38,000 --> 03:40:40,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

2641
03:40:40,000 --> 03:40:42,000
Hold on a second.

2642
03:40:42,000 --> 03:40:44,000
Wait just a second here.

2643
03:40:44,000 --> 03:40:46,000
Get rid of all of this.

2644
03:40:46,000 --> 03:40:49,000
You're going to go mid jump.

2645
03:40:49,000 --> 03:40:55,000
Where do you end up?

2646
03:40:55,000 --> 03:40:58,000
Right there.

2647
03:40:58,000 --> 03:41:02,000
Actually, even further jump.

2648
03:41:02,000 --> 03:41:08,000
Now it comes out too fast.

2649
03:41:08,000 --> 03:41:11,000
Bang.

2650
03:41:11,000 --> 03:41:19,000
Right there.

2651
03:41:19,000 --> 03:41:22,000
Getting carried away.

2652
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:25,000
Oh, that's cool.

2653
03:41:25,000 --> 03:41:34,000
That's cool.

2654
03:41:34,000 --> 03:41:38,000
Now, fucking fell off.

2655
03:41:38,000 --> 03:41:39,000
Is there a way?

2656
03:41:39,000 --> 03:41:46,000
I wish I had a way to mess with this guy's behavior, huh?

2657
03:41:46,000 --> 03:41:50,000
I guess I could just do this.

2658
03:41:50,000 --> 03:42:04,000
That's easy enough.

2659
03:42:04,000 --> 03:42:06,000
Let's try that.

2660
03:42:06,000 --> 03:42:10,000
Is he going to jump?

2661
03:42:10,000 --> 03:42:14,000
So, yeah, you missed that mushroom.

2662
03:42:14,000 --> 03:42:16,000
You got to start over again.

2663
03:42:16,000 --> 03:42:21,000
Maybe I'll do like...

2664
03:42:21,000 --> 03:42:22,000
Okay.

2665
03:42:22,000 --> 03:42:24,000
Might be a little too much.

2666
03:42:24,000 --> 03:42:30,000
Maybe.

2667
03:42:30,000 --> 03:42:34,000
And then you can use that to jump up here.

2668
03:42:34,000 --> 03:42:45,000
Alright.

2669
03:42:45,000 --> 03:42:48,000
I'm going to go to the green shell.

2670
03:42:48,000 --> 03:42:55,000
Make them a red shell, it's Koopa.

2671
03:42:55,000 --> 03:42:57,000
Shake the Koopa to make him turn right.

2672
03:42:57,000 --> 03:43:01,000
Usually coins do.

2673
03:43:01,000 --> 03:43:08,000
Guess not.

2674
03:43:08,000 --> 03:43:12,000
Oh, where are you going to?

2675
03:43:12,000 --> 03:43:15,000
You don't have to do that.

2676
03:43:15,000 --> 03:43:16,000
You're right.

2677
03:43:16,000 --> 03:43:19,000
You're right, chatter.

2678
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:26,000
I don't know if I do this.

2679
03:43:26,000 --> 03:43:29,000
It's still possible.

2680
03:43:29,000 --> 03:43:35,000
It's definitely still possible.

2681
03:43:35,000 --> 03:43:41,000
Okay, but even higher.

2682
03:43:41,000 --> 03:43:44,000
That might be too high to even hit.

2683
03:43:44,000 --> 03:43:47,000
There we are.

2684
03:43:47,000 --> 03:43:51,000
No, you have to do that.

2685
03:43:51,000 --> 03:44:01,000
Got a time it right.

2686
03:44:01,000 --> 03:44:05,000
Oh, I see, I can't even time it.

2687
03:44:05,000 --> 03:44:06,000
I like it.

2688
03:44:06,000 --> 03:44:09,000
I wish I could put more things in here.

2689
03:44:09,000 --> 03:44:16,000
I would put this all around being able to do jumps like that.

2690
03:44:16,000 --> 03:44:23,000
Alright, so we can get rid of this now.

2691
03:44:23,000 --> 03:44:26,000
The reds walk up the edge.

2692
03:44:26,000 --> 03:44:30,000
Sounds like plan.

2693
03:44:30,000 --> 03:44:34,000
I put a couple over there.

2694
03:44:34,000 --> 03:44:37,000
I'm not going to put like...

2695
03:44:37,000 --> 03:44:38,000
You do two.

2696
03:44:38,000 --> 03:44:39,000
You do two.

2697
03:44:39,000 --> 03:44:40,000
No, one.

2698
03:44:40,000 --> 03:44:43,000
We'll do one with one.

2699
03:44:43,000 --> 03:44:48,000
Let's go.

2700
03:44:48,000 --> 03:44:52,000
Moving backwards too much.

2701
03:44:52,000 --> 03:44:56,000
Not enough momentum.

2702
03:44:56,000 --> 03:44:59,000
I like this.

2703
03:44:59,000 --> 03:45:03,000
Alright, this works.

2704
03:45:04,000 --> 03:45:09,000
Yeah, see, and I get screwed up with those guys.

2705
03:45:09,000 --> 03:45:11,000
You can save, right?

2706
03:45:11,000 --> 03:45:17,000
Because I want to actually get items and use them.

2707
03:45:17,000 --> 03:45:20,000
Like a saw blade come across here.

2708
03:45:20,000 --> 03:45:29,000
I have just like bullet bills shooting this direction.

2709
03:45:29,000 --> 03:45:39,000
No, that's good enough.

2710
03:45:39,000 --> 03:45:41,000
Oh no, I got to the end.

2711
03:45:41,000 --> 03:45:46,000
I can't get out of here.

2712
03:45:46,000 --> 03:45:50,000
Can you get the mushroom go back and just do the jump a second time?

2713
03:45:50,000 --> 03:45:54,000
I don't think so.

2714
03:45:54,000 --> 03:46:03,000
I mean, a baby you can, but it's kind of hard.

2715
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:07,000
Trying to replicate what you're asking.

2716
03:46:07,000 --> 03:46:11,000
Yeah, I guess you can.

2717
03:46:11,000 --> 03:46:15,000
Is it time to remove this?

2718
03:46:15,000 --> 03:46:18,000
Is that still?

2719
03:46:18,000 --> 03:46:21,000
Is that doable?

2720
03:46:22,000 --> 03:46:35,000
What the hell is this mushroom doing?

2721
03:46:35,000 --> 03:46:37,000
I can throw the mushroom out of it.

2722
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:41,000
Shaking this doesn't do much.

2723
03:46:41,000 --> 03:46:42,000
Why is that?

2724
03:46:42,000 --> 03:46:45,000
I can't turn it into one up.

2725
03:46:52,000 --> 03:46:57,000
I don't even know if this is still possible.

2726
03:46:57,000 --> 03:47:01,000
I don't know, now that it's there, I might have to move it a little forward a little bit.

2727
03:47:01,000 --> 03:47:05,000
Try to a couple more times.

2728
03:47:08,000 --> 03:47:11,000
Yeah, I'm going to have to move it.

2729
03:47:11,000 --> 03:47:12,000
Not to move it.

2730
03:47:12,000 --> 03:47:15,000
One more block this way.

2731
03:47:15,000 --> 03:47:20,000
That's a month.

2732
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:26,000
Put a brick over the first two open bricks so you can only run and build a momentum.

2733
03:47:26,000 --> 03:47:32,000
That's not a bad idea.

2734
03:47:32,000 --> 03:47:39,000
Oops.

2735
03:47:39,000 --> 03:47:43,000
Yeah, you've just barely made it.

2736
03:47:43,000 --> 03:47:47,000
All right, now I have to test to make sure you can't go backwards.

2737
03:47:47,000 --> 03:47:50,000
Can you get this and still come back?

2738
03:47:50,000 --> 03:47:54,000
No, not really.

2739
03:48:01,000 --> 03:48:06,000
Maybe you're saying like put one here.

2740
03:48:06,000 --> 03:48:10,000
Let's try it.

2741
03:48:11,000 --> 03:48:16,000
I could spend all day doing this if I had more things.

2742
03:48:19,000 --> 03:48:22,000
You can turn Mario into a Luigi.

2743
03:48:22,000 --> 03:48:28,000
You make him bigger, small.

2744
03:48:29,000 --> 03:48:35,000
I just wish I could put more of these things.

2745
03:48:35,000 --> 03:48:40,000
I can't really do much.

2746
03:48:45,000 --> 03:48:49,000
So I have to move my like a wee clock forward.

2747
03:48:49,000 --> 03:48:55,000
Is that what I have to do?

2748
03:48:55,000 --> 03:49:00,000
Apparently.

2749
03:49:00,000 --> 03:49:05,000
Maybe for next time.

2750
03:49:05,000 --> 03:49:12,000
I like to put much more hazards and things here, but there's not very much to start off with.

2751
03:49:12,000 --> 03:49:17,000
Save this though.

2752
03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:23,000
Wait a second.

2753
03:49:23,000 --> 03:49:30,000
Who's there?

2754
03:49:30,000 --> 03:49:36,000
If you frustrate your players and the first jump, your level is not going to rate well.

2755
03:49:36,000 --> 03:49:42,000
I'll tweak it.

2756
03:49:43,000 --> 03:49:48,000
I'll tweak this in some other day.

2757
03:49:59,000 --> 03:50:04,000
Make much of junk blocks.

2758
03:50:05,000 --> 03:50:10,000
What is this thing even do?

2759
03:50:10,000 --> 03:50:15,000
Random property?

2760
03:50:15,000 --> 03:50:20,000
Whatever.

2761
03:50:20,000 --> 03:50:25,000
You unlock more by beating other people's levels.

2762
03:50:25,000 --> 03:50:30,000
I beat a bunch earlier.

2763
03:50:30,000 --> 03:50:35,000
I can get some more stuff unlocked.

2764
03:50:35,000 --> 03:50:40,000
It's about no.

2765
03:50:40,000 --> 03:50:45,000
I'll play in a little string of levels.

2766
03:50:45,000 --> 03:50:52,000
I'm going to go to bed.

2767
03:50:52,000 --> 03:50:57,000
I don't want to get something interesting done with it.

2768
03:50:57,000 --> 03:51:02,000
I've been playing that multiple times.

2769
03:51:02,000 --> 03:51:07,000
But not so terrible that you end up like I was yelling at things.

2770
03:51:07,000 --> 03:51:12,000
To be fair though, that level of that guy made was pretty damn good.

2771
03:51:12,000 --> 03:51:19,000
Alright, 10 Mario Challenge.

2772
03:51:19,000 --> 03:51:24,000
Can I do this one on normal or expert or something?

2773
03:51:25,000 --> 03:51:30,000
No.

2774
03:51:30,000 --> 03:51:36,000
You know that I've had some time to warm up a little bit.

2775
03:51:36,000 --> 03:51:41,000
I want to go.

2776
03:51:41,000 --> 03:51:45,000
We'll try one of the good featured ones.

2777
03:51:45,000 --> 03:51:51,000
I was all over the place earlier this evening.

2778
03:51:52,000 --> 03:51:56,000
So there's only a 20 to 20.

2779
03:51:56,000 --> 03:51:59,000
2.37% clear.

2780
03:51:59,000 --> 03:52:02,000
So no, maybe I wasn't crazy.

2781
03:52:02,000 --> 03:52:05,000
This is just extremely difficult.

2782
03:52:05,000 --> 03:52:12,000
Only 15 people have beaten it at a 632 times or 632 people.

2783
03:52:12,000 --> 03:52:18,000
That's kind of crazy.

2784
03:52:18,000 --> 03:52:21,000
Let's go back.

2785
03:52:21,000 --> 03:52:27,000
Where's one with like a 20% or 10% or something?

2786
03:52:27,000 --> 03:52:29,000
Alright, one shell.

2787
03:52:29,000 --> 03:52:32,000
This is a 1% clear ratio.

2788
03:52:32,000 --> 03:52:36,000
Damn, by star ranking.

2789
03:52:36,000 --> 03:52:38,000
Don't press anything.

2790
03:52:38,000 --> 03:52:40,000
I played that one before, didn't I?

2791
03:52:40,000 --> 03:52:42,000
Look at how many ratings this has.

2792
03:52:42,000 --> 03:52:45,000
Don't press anything too.

2793
03:52:45,000 --> 03:52:49,000
Press right, run and enjoy.

2794
03:52:49,000 --> 03:52:52,000
Let's do that one.

2795
03:52:52,000 --> 03:52:59,000
53, you can apparently still not beat this one.

2796
03:52:59,000 --> 03:53:02,000
Let's go for it.

2797
03:53:02,000 --> 03:53:05,000
Let's go for it.

2798
03:53:05,000 --> 03:53:08,000
I need to.

2799
03:53:08,000 --> 03:53:12,000
Alright, press right.

2800
03:53:12,000 --> 03:53:15,000
I was holding right.

2801
03:53:15,000 --> 03:53:18,000
I did something wrong.

2802
03:53:18,000 --> 03:53:21,000
Look at all the deaths.

2803
03:53:21,000 --> 03:53:24,000
A ton of people died there.

2804
03:53:24,000 --> 03:53:26,000
It says something.

2805
03:53:26,000 --> 03:53:29,000
He's in a car.

2806
03:53:29,000 --> 03:53:35,000
I'm in a little go-cart.

2807
03:53:35,000 --> 03:53:39,000
Think about how long this stuff can make.

2808
03:53:39,000 --> 03:53:41,000
Mario in a go-cart.

2809
03:53:41,000 --> 03:53:43,000
I'm in a straight.

2810
03:53:43,000 --> 03:53:48,000
Then a bunch of cool things happen around you.

2811
03:53:48,000 --> 03:53:55,000
They're like I'm playing braid.

2812
03:53:55,000 --> 03:53:58,000
This is so cool.

2813
03:53:58,000 --> 03:53:59,000
Damn, man.

2814
03:53:59,000 --> 03:54:02,000
Some people are just super, super crazy creative.

2815
03:54:02,000 --> 03:54:03,000
That was awesome.

2816
03:54:03,000 --> 03:54:06,000
That was so cool.

2817
03:54:12,000 --> 03:54:17,000
What else is there?

2818
03:54:17,000 --> 03:54:19,000
Well, the pyro.

2819
03:54:19,000 --> 03:54:24,000
That was maybe the pyro.

2820
03:54:24,000 --> 03:54:26,000
Alright, what about...

2821
03:54:26,000 --> 03:54:27,000
What about don't press anything?

2822
03:54:27,000 --> 03:54:29,000
This is the highest rated thing.

2823
03:54:29,000 --> 03:54:32,000
We already saw a version of this, didn't we?

2824
03:54:32,000 --> 03:54:35,000
Let's check out this one.

2825
03:54:35,000 --> 03:54:40,000
Don't press anything.

2826
03:54:40,000 --> 03:54:47,000
What is even happening?

2827
03:54:47,000 --> 03:54:49,000
How did you even...

2828
03:54:49,000 --> 03:54:53,000
The program...

2829
03:54:53,000 --> 03:54:58,000
Look at that look at that close here.

2830
03:54:58,000 --> 03:55:03,000
The coolest roller coaster.

2831
03:55:03,000 --> 03:55:04,000
Smart.

2832
03:55:04,000 --> 03:55:05,000
Weee.

2833
03:55:05,000 --> 03:55:15,000
This is no way this person doesn't have an engineering degree.

2834
03:55:15,000 --> 03:55:22,000
The person that made this level has a PhD in mechanical engineering.

2835
03:55:22,000 --> 03:55:39,000
What else is there? How do you fail that? You just have to just move.

2836
03:55:39,000 --> 03:55:46,000
40% clear right? That means like 60% of the people just walking around trying to jump.

2837
03:55:46,000 --> 03:55:51,000
Okay this is don't press anything too. It's by the same guy.

2838
03:55:54,000 --> 03:56:00,000
Yeah, I think it's the same guy right? Let's see how good the sequel is.

2839
03:56:01,000 --> 03:56:05,000
Did I just get a cat paw?

2840
03:56:08,000 --> 03:56:12,000
Okay that was cool. That was really cool.

2841
03:56:16,000 --> 03:56:24,000
Is it good? Is it good? Is it good? I'm pretty sure that's a dick.

2842
03:56:24,000 --> 03:56:34,000
Otherwise he has three hands. No, that was too armed. No, that's not.

2843
03:56:37,000 --> 03:56:42,000
Hardy time. Bring the disco. So what do you call him?

2844
03:56:42,000 --> 03:56:51,000
Who was never touching him? I didn't walk right there.

2845
03:56:51,000 --> 03:56:53,000
Cool.

2846
03:56:57,000 --> 03:57:01,000
I like those. I was watching a little short. That was like watching a movie.

2847
03:57:01,000 --> 03:57:06,000
I watched a little TV show. Mario TV show.

2848
03:57:06,000 --> 03:57:10,000
What else is there? Splatoon.

2849
03:57:12,000 --> 03:57:16,000
This has a 60% clear right? Let's play this one. Do I get to move in this one?

2850
03:57:16,000 --> 03:57:20,000
Do I get to play the game in this one? We'll find out.

2851
03:57:22,000 --> 03:57:25,000
Your squid now. Now a little squid.

2852
03:57:25,000 --> 03:57:29,000
And those would like to be Mario. It's kind of like text huh?

2853
03:57:30,000 --> 03:57:34,000
I really am a squid.

2854
03:57:35,000 --> 03:57:37,000
So cute.

2855
03:57:37,000 --> 03:57:39,000
Hello out.

2856
03:57:40,000 --> 03:57:43,000
So what happens? How does so many text does?

2857
03:57:47,000 --> 03:57:48,000
Need to draw that?

2858
03:57:50,000 --> 03:57:52,000
Let's get real looking entire comic book.

2859
03:57:55,000 --> 03:57:58,000
Look at this. Just dude has a whole graphic novel in here.

2860
03:58:00,000 --> 03:58:03,000
I'm trying to know I'm going just the wrong way. I'm reading his.

2861
03:58:04,000 --> 03:58:08,000
I'm stuck in here. I'm stuck in here. I'm gonna lose. I'm gonna lose to the

2862
03:58:08,000 --> 03:58:09,000
Yura squid level.

2863
03:58:13,000 --> 03:58:16,000
No, not. I have the power of the cat to protect me.

2864
03:58:19,000 --> 03:58:21,000
There's that one up.

2865
03:58:22,000 --> 03:58:28,000
This one. What can I write a comment?

2866
03:58:30,000 --> 03:58:31,000
How do I write a comment here?

2867
03:58:35,000 --> 03:58:42,000
Oh no, Bowser. Oh shit.

2868
03:58:43,000 --> 03:58:45,000
Now there's an actual game here.

2869
03:58:46,000 --> 03:58:54,000
I must try. I'm like just reading what the purple is saying. Look at all those deaths.

2870
03:59:00,000 --> 03:59:03,000
I need to write something. I need to write like. I need to write.

2871
03:59:03,000 --> 03:59:05,000
I'll about.

2872
03:59:05,000 --> 03:59:07,000
God, I'm just gonna write in all capitals.

2873
03:59:10,000 --> 03:59:11,000
Cuity pot.

2874
03:59:14,000 --> 03:59:15,000
Makes it go.

2875
03:59:21,000 --> 03:59:23,000
Well, I died in that one because I'm reading all the weird text.

2876
03:59:27,000 --> 03:59:28,000
Don't touch the shrooms.

2877
03:59:29,000 --> 03:59:32,000
Sonic 1.

2878
03:59:33,000 --> 03:59:35,000
All right, I gotta check this one out.

2879
03:59:36,000 --> 03:59:38,000
This is apparently Sonic the Hedgehog.

2880
03:59:43,000 --> 03:59:45,000
Wait, I should probably pick. I should get that.

2881
03:59:49,000 --> 03:59:52,000
So hold on a second. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Go back.

2882
03:59:53,000 --> 03:59:54,000
I can't wait.

2883
03:59:54,000 --> 03:59:56,000
Sonic the Hedgehog is in the game.

2884
03:59:57,000 --> 04:00:01,000
Did that dude upload that or is that in this video game?

2885
04:00:02,000 --> 04:00:05,000
That's Sonic the fucking Hedgehog in this game.

2886
04:00:07,000 --> 04:00:14,000
I'm confused, but I don't know. I don't understand. That's interesting to say the least.

2887
04:00:14,000 --> 04:00:23,000
That's surprising.

2888
04:00:26,000 --> 04:00:29,000
Oh, is it a mebo? It's an amoebo.

2889
04:00:35,000 --> 04:00:37,000
Here it begins the memes.

2890
04:00:38,000 --> 04:00:39,000
You're all right about that.

2891
04:00:39,000 --> 04:00:43,000
I thought he was a bush. He wasn't rolling.

2892
04:00:47,000 --> 04:00:50,000
Yeah, what I fell to.

2893
04:00:51,000 --> 04:00:53,000
I hate the dude. Come on. Step it up.

2894
04:00:54,000 --> 04:00:57,000
It has the ring sound too.

2895
04:00:59,000 --> 04:01:00,000
Yikes.

2896
04:01:02,000 --> 04:01:03,000
Let me jump on these things.

2897
04:01:04,000 --> 04:01:09,000
Run.

2898
04:01:13,000 --> 04:01:13,000
Okay.

2899
04:01:16,000 --> 04:01:18,000
Did you just say Pac-Man is in this game?

2900
04:01:20,000 --> 04:01:21,000
Pac-Man is in the game.

2901
04:01:23,000 --> 04:01:23,000
Where is he?

2902
04:01:24,000 --> 04:01:26,000
Where is he and how do I get him?

2903
04:01:28,000 --> 04:01:29,000
That's unbelievable.

2904
04:01:29,000 --> 04:01:32,000
I tied away search for Pac-Man.

2905
04:01:34,000 --> 04:01:36,000
Metroid.

2906
04:01:37,000 --> 04:01:38,000
Donkey Kong.

2907
04:01:39,000 --> 04:01:40,000
No, no, no. Give me a Pac-Man level.

2908
04:01:43,000 --> 04:01:45,000
Featured. Search. Here we go. Pac-Man.

2909
04:01:47,000 --> 04:01:48,000
Pac-Man.

2910
04:01:51,000 --> 04:01:51,000
Okay.

2911
04:01:54,000 --> 04:01:54,000
Of course not.

2912
04:01:56,000 --> 04:01:57,000
Oh, this is...

2913
04:01:57,000 --> 04:01:59,000
No, that's like a code.

2914
04:01:59,000 --> 04:02:00,000
Like a friend code.

2915
04:02:03,000 --> 04:02:06,000
Top right.

2916
04:02:11,000 --> 04:02:15,000
Get a go get a Pac-Man of Bebo.

2917
04:02:18,000 --> 04:02:22,000
Look at this. Look at some popular rankings here.

2918
04:02:22,000 --> 04:02:26,000
Look at that. Those are the two guys that have the most popular thing, huh?

2919
04:02:29,000 --> 04:02:31,000
Mega Man's in it.

2920
04:02:31,000 --> 04:02:32,000
Mega Man's in it.

2921
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:33,000
That's really, really, really cool.

2922
04:02:37,000 --> 04:02:39,000
All right. What are some of these levels?

2923
04:02:39,000 --> 04:02:43,000
Somebody was saying I should play a certain person's level.

2924
04:02:44,000 --> 04:02:46,000
And I couldn't... I don't remember who it was.

2925
04:02:50,000 --> 04:02:50,000
There were a lot of people.

2926
04:02:56,000 --> 04:02:59,000
Who's levels were you guys all saying to play?

2927
04:02:59,000 --> 04:03:00,000
Or somebody? So was it this guy?

2928
04:03:02,000 --> 04:03:03,000
Ross the suit?

2929
04:03:04,000 --> 04:03:06,000
Yeah, everyone was saying to play this guy's levels.

2930
04:03:07,000 --> 04:03:08,000
Okay.

2931
04:03:11,000 --> 04:03:13,000
We're gonna go with please dance.

2932
04:03:15,000 --> 04:03:17,000
Sure. Let's play please dance.

2933
04:03:24,000 --> 04:03:25,000
Not bad. Get ready to dance.

2934
04:03:29,000 --> 04:03:30,000
Come on. Make sure there's no secrets.

2935
04:03:31,000 --> 04:03:33,000
I gotta make sure there's no secrets.

2936
04:03:33,000 --> 04:03:35,000
That's a secret. Found it.

2937
04:03:36,000 --> 04:03:37,000
Found the secret I went.

2938
04:03:39,000 --> 04:03:41,000
So to the 5,000 other people.

2939
04:03:47,000 --> 04:03:48,000
All right. Let's just like actually do the level.

2940
04:03:59,000 --> 04:04:00,000
I can't get those pipes in.

2941
04:04:00,000 --> 04:04:01,000
Let's go.

2942
04:04:07,000 --> 04:04:08,000
Is this good?

2943
04:04:10,000 --> 04:04:11,000
Is this dance party with the ocean?

2944
04:04:18,000 --> 04:04:20,000
All right. Okay.

2945
04:04:21,000 --> 04:04:22,000
We did the dance party.

2946
04:04:24,000 --> 04:04:25,000
How do I get out?

2947
04:04:29,000 --> 04:04:31,000
I don't like that. I forgot Yoshi has that move.

2948
04:04:33,000 --> 04:04:35,000
It'd be nice if I could do it.

2949
04:04:35,000 --> 04:04:36,000
What you know do this?

2950
04:04:41,000 --> 04:04:41,000
I wouldn't.

2951
04:04:46,000 --> 04:04:47,000
All right. He's gonna pack my level.

2952
04:04:47,000 --> 04:04:48,000
Where's his pack man level?

2953
04:04:49,000 --> 04:04:58,000
Who's I'm gonna have to buy a pack man and me boh if that's in the game?

2954
04:05:06,000 --> 04:05:07,000
Ultimate life form Bowser's trap.

2955
04:05:11,000 --> 04:05:11,000
Pack Mario.

2956
04:05:14,000 --> 04:05:14,000
Yes.

2957
04:05:16,000 --> 04:05:17,000
Yes.

2958
04:05:19,000 --> 04:05:23,000
Where is it?

2959
04:05:29,000 --> 04:05:31,000
It's even the pack man with the big nose.

2960
04:05:32,000 --> 04:05:33,000
But he turns into a banana.

2961
04:05:35,000 --> 04:05:36,000
That's so cool.

2962
04:05:38,000 --> 04:05:39,000
Can you do anything else?

2963
04:05:39,000 --> 04:05:41,000
Because I just stand there like an idiot.

2964
04:05:43,000 --> 04:05:44,000
All right. Let's go.

2965
04:05:49,000 --> 04:05:51,000
Oh, look at when he swims. He turns. That's all. That's so cool.

2966
04:05:53,000 --> 04:05:55,000
I lost it already. I was too busy.

2967
04:05:56,000 --> 04:05:57,000
I was too busy.

2968
04:05:57,000 --> 04:05:58,000
Fanboying over pack man.

2969
04:06:03,000 --> 04:06:06,000
You know what I first purchased this game.

2970
04:06:07,000 --> 04:06:12,000
I thought that it was going to be extremely limited and not fun.

2971
04:06:14,000 --> 04:06:15,000
This is pretty cool though.

2972
04:06:15,000 --> 04:06:16,000
Can't go down what?

2973
04:06:17,000 --> 04:06:17,000
What?

2974
04:06:19,000 --> 04:06:20,000
I don't know.

2975
04:06:31,000 --> 04:06:33,000
You can press up.

2976
04:06:35,000 --> 04:06:36,000
You can press up.

2977
04:06:36,000 --> 04:06:38,000
I just want to look at him one more time.

2978
04:06:41,000 --> 04:06:41,000
Let me get it.

2979
04:06:41,000 --> 04:06:42,000
Give me the pack man.

2980
04:06:49,000 --> 04:06:51,000
He'll let it fruit.

2981
04:06:54,000 --> 04:06:55,000
That's awesome.

2982
04:07:01,000 --> 04:07:02,000
Go go go go go go go.

2983
04:07:04,000 --> 04:07:06,000
Can I actually run into them?

2984
04:07:06,000 --> 04:07:07,000
Come on.

2985
04:07:08,000 --> 04:07:09,000
But whatever.

2986
04:07:14,000 --> 04:07:16,000
Easy. Easy.

2987
04:07:19,000 --> 04:07:23,000
I did it.

2988
04:07:25,000 --> 04:07:25,000
All right.

2989
04:07:27,000 --> 04:07:29,000
Maybe one or two more and I'm probably going to hit the head.

2990
04:07:29,000 --> 04:07:30,000
Tip of the hats as well.

2991
04:07:31,000 --> 04:07:33,000
Is tomorrow I should probably be up.

2992
04:07:33,000 --> 04:07:35,000
I got some work that's being done still.

2993
04:07:42,000 --> 04:07:44,000
But thank you guys for coming out.

2994
04:07:45,000 --> 04:07:46,000
Then witnessing my um

2995
04:07:49,000 --> 04:07:52,000
my very bad not good

2996
04:07:54,000 --> 04:07:55,000
playing this game.

2997
04:07:56,000 --> 04:07:57,000
It was fun though.

2998
04:07:58,000 --> 04:08:00,000
There was a couple of points that I was getting uh

2999
04:08:02,000 --> 04:08:03,000
getting super salty.

3000
04:08:03,000 --> 04:08:04,000
Oh wow.

3001
04:08:04,000 --> 04:08:05,000
So much so salty.

3002
04:08:07,000 --> 04:08:07,000
But it's fun.

3003
04:08:07,000 --> 04:08:08,000
This is great game.

3004
04:08:10,000 --> 04:08:13,000
Highly recommend if you uh

3005
04:08:13,000 --> 04:08:14,000
are into this kind of thing.

3006
04:08:14,000 --> 04:08:14,000
It's really fun.

3007
04:08:16,000 --> 04:08:17,000
I'll do one more.

3008
04:08:17,000 --> 04:08:18,000
We'll do one more hard one.

3009
04:08:18,000 --> 04:08:20,000
And I'll try it like five or ten times or something.

3010
04:08:24,000 --> 04:08:25,000
Like courses.

3011
04:08:25,000 --> 04:08:27,000
So I'm going to try to beat that one that was giving me trouble before.

3012
04:08:32,000 --> 04:08:33,000
This one.

3013
04:08:34,000 --> 04:08:36,000
Just the one with a two percent clear right.

3014
04:08:40,000 --> 04:08:40,000
All right.

3015
04:08:41,000 --> 04:08:42,000
Let's try to remember how this worked.

3016
04:08:48,000 --> 04:08:49,000
Oh yeah.

3017
04:08:49,000 --> 04:08:49,000
I forgot.

3018
04:08:53,000 --> 04:08:54,000
Mr. Chops.

3019
04:08:55,000 --> 04:08:56,000
At least I don't have a set amount of lives here.

3020
04:09:06,000 --> 04:09:07,000
So I should have done from the very beginning.

3021
04:09:11,000 --> 04:09:13,000
Well that's something I had to press.

3022
04:09:18,000 --> 04:09:21,000
We didn't get you to put a fork in the outlet.

3023
04:09:21,000 --> 04:09:21,000
No we didn't.

3024
04:09:24,000 --> 04:09:25,000
We did not.

3025
04:09:29,000 --> 04:09:33,000
Also this is my first time I've ever streamed on a console.

3026
04:09:34,000 --> 04:09:38,000
So I have to work out the bugs and all the you know

3027
04:09:38,000 --> 04:09:42,000
kinks and stuff because there were quite a few of them unfortunately.

3028
04:09:44,000 --> 04:09:45,000
I'm going to wait till they both up.

3029
04:09:49,000 --> 04:09:51,000
Come on jump up there join your friend.

3030
04:09:57,000 --> 04:09:58,000
Shit I would have gone through.

3031
04:10:02,000 --> 04:10:04,000
I was going to figure out that delay.

3032
04:10:06,000 --> 04:10:13,000
Not just like the random weird like input delay of feeling but the delay of the audio that was

3033
04:10:13,000 --> 04:10:13,000
happening.

3034
04:10:19,000 --> 04:10:24,000
Some people have said that there's been a couple of flashes like it just flashed once or twice.

3035
04:10:26,000 --> 04:10:27,000
Audio delay for some people.

3036
04:10:27,000 --> 04:10:28,000
I'll figure it out.

3037
04:10:32,000 --> 04:10:33,000
I hope.

3038
04:10:38,000 --> 04:10:39,000
I should have waited.

3039
04:10:39,000 --> 04:10:40,000
Ah I should have waited.

3040
04:10:40,000 --> 04:10:42,000
Should I I can stand right there and be totally fine.

3041
04:10:43,000 --> 04:10:46,000
If I stand right there they won't hit me with any of their crap.

3042
04:10:47,000 --> 04:10:48,000
I'm waiting too long.

3043
04:10:51,000 --> 04:10:52,000
I actually think I'll be able to get this.

3044
04:10:52,000 --> 04:10:53,000
I think I'll be able to beat this one.

3045
04:10:53,000 --> 04:10:55,000
I warmed up enough and I played enough of this game.

3046
04:10:56,000 --> 04:11:02,000
And after a few minutes I should be able to get this.

3047
04:11:11,000 --> 04:11:14,000
I wasn't I was looking over to the right just trying to get the opportunity to run.

3048
04:11:17,000 --> 04:11:19,000
I'm going to try that this time.

3049
04:11:19,000 --> 04:11:21,000
I'm going to try to jump and hit them underneath.

3050
04:11:23,000 --> 04:11:25,000
Seems like a good idea.

3051
04:11:31,000 --> 04:11:34,000
Oh I can't I cannot hit them but I'm going to say a spot.

3052
04:11:34,000 --> 04:11:36,000
Jumped down.

3053
04:11:36,000 --> 04:11:42,000
See that just kind of threw a cog into my brain.

3054
04:11:42,000 --> 04:11:44,000
When I couldn't hit them from underneath.

3055
04:11:44,000 --> 04:11:46,000
I just assumed I was safe for some reason.

3056
04:11:52,000 --> 04:11:54,000
I'm going to be one of those two percent.

3057
04:11:58,000 --> 04:12:02,000
I will be one of those two point seven percent people.

3058
04:12:12,000 --> 04:12:16,000
Come on now.

3059
04:12:16,000 --> 04:12:18,000
I need to do too many.

3060
04:12:18,000 --> 04:12:22,000
Now I'm in deep shit.

3061
04:12:22,000 --> 04:12:26,000
I'm in deep shit.

3062
04:12:27,000 --> 04:12:33,000
I'm in deep shit.

3063
04:12:44,000 --> 04:12:46,000
I'm just like locked in right now.

3064
04:12:46,000 --> 04:12:48,000
I didn't I was hypnotized.

3065
04:12:50,000 --> 04:12:53,000
I was under legit hypnosis right there.

3066
04:12:54,000 --> 04:12:55,000
I didn't know.

3067
04:12:56,000 --> 04:12:58,000
It feels like I was at a magic show.

3068
04:13:01,000 --> 04:13:02,000
You gotta go right.

3069
04:13:04,000 --> 04:13:05,000
Mmmmmm, now.

3070
04:13:11,000 --> 04:13:12,000
Holy dog shit, okay.

3071
04:13:13,000 --> 04:13:14,000
Need to wait till the end of that thing.

3072
04:13:18,000 --> 04:13:20,000
I will be in the 2.7%

3073
04:13:20,000 --> 04:13:21,000
I'm gonna do it.

3074
04:13:23,000 --> 04:13:24,000
I'm gonna do it!

3075
04:13:24,000 --> 04:13:26,000
No, I know that happens at the end. I'm gonna do it.

3076
04:13:33,000 --> 04:13:35,000
We are way through the one to fly up there

3077
04:13:43,000 --> 04:13:45,000
Shit

3078
04:13:45,000 --> 04:13:48,000
My god, I could have gone up. I could have gone up

3079
04:13:49,000 --> 04:13:51,000
I could have gone up

3080
04:13:52,000 --> 04:13:54,000
That's the worst part when you play through these levels there

3081
04:13:54,000 --> 04:13:57,000
Like kind of you have to memorize things and you see something right at the very end

3082
04:13:57,000 --> 04:14:00,000
I saw that right at the very end that I could have probably got a mushroom there

3083
04:14:06,000 --> 04:14:08,000
I don't think I have a good opportunity anymore

3084
04:14:10,000 --> 04:14:12,000
Maybe right now

3085
04:14:14,000 --> 04:14:15,000
Nope

3086
04:14:15,000 --> 04:14:16,000
Right

3087
04:14:16,000 --> 04:14:18,000
Did they just throw way more than usual?

3088
04:14:22,000 --> 04:14:24,000
Get out of here

3089
04:14:32,000 --> 04:14:34,000
You got to be shitting me right now

3090
04:14:34,000 --> 04:14:37,000
You've got to be absolutely shitting me

3091
04:14:37,000 --> 04:14:40,000
I'm very, very mad at that one

3092
04:14:40,000 --> 04:14:43,000
I showed a hit him right now, fucking cron of his head

3093
04:14:44,000 --> 04:14:46,000
That one was perfect

3094
04:14:46,000 --> 04:14:49,000
And then of course it all goes to hell

3095
04:14:49,000 --> 04:14:51,000
Like it typically does

3096
04:14:59,000 --> 04:15:01,000
I really want to stop this from moving

3097
04:15:03,000 --> 04:15:05,000
I came off further than I thought

3098
04:15:06,000 --> 04:15:08,000
I should have been attacked

3099
04:15:11,000 --> 04:15:13,000
That was just an extremely stupid move

3100
04:15:17,000 --> 04:15:19,000
I'm gonna get it

3101
04:15:23,000 --> 04:15:25,000
I have to get this before I go to bed

3102
04:15:25,000 --> 04:15:27,000
That's extremely important

3103
04:15:36,000 --> 04:15:38,000
Guys throws a perfect pitch down the middle right there

3104
04:15:48,000 --> 04:15:50,000
Damn, this is fucking hard as shit

3105
04:15:51,000 --> 04:15:53,000
I didn't mean to do that

3106
04:16:06,000 --> 04:16:08,000
I'm gonna get this

3107
04:16:20,000 --> 04:16:22,000
I should have kept running

3108
04:16:26,000 --> 04:16:30,000
It's actually surprising that only 3% of every person that's played this has beaten it

3109
04:16:30,000 --> 04:16:32,000
That's kinda funny

3110
04:16:32,000 --> 04:16:34,000
You think it'd be a lot more

3111
04:16:35,000 --> 04:16:37,000
I should have just jumped again

3112
04:16:41,000 --> 04:16:43,000
Should have wore a color

3113
04:17:06,000 --> 04:17:11,000
This one's the fireballs that just get annoying

3114
04:17:11,000 --> 04:17:15,000
And here comes a la key to whatever his name is

3115
04:17:17,000 --> 04:17:20,000
You're not dropped on

3116
04:17:20,000 --> 04:17:22,000
Let me get you

3117
04:17:23,000 --> 04:17:26,000
What the hell was that? What did they just do?

3118
04:17:26,000 --> 04:17:28,000
No, I got a move

3119
04:17:28,000 --> 04:17:30,000
It's not gonna happen

3120
04:17:31,000 --> 04:17:33,000
I'm just over there

3121
04:17:36,000 --> 04:17:39,000
I'm over complicating things when I get there

3122
04:17:42,000 --> 04:17:46,000
Massively just over complicating the shit out of that every time I get there

3123
04:17:48,000 --> 04:17:52,000
I didn't even need to jump as soon as I get over there jump jump jump and get up and kill him

3124
04:17:53,000 --> 04:17:56,000
Because he's such a ping in the ass at that part

3125
04:17:56,000 --> 04:17:58,000
Because he's throwing shit down when things are coming up

3126
04:18:01,000 --> 04:18:04,000
I was literally reading chat

3127
04:18:04,000 --> 04:18:06,000
My face is just down

3128
04:18:09,000 --> 04:18:11,000
Oh, it's very possible

3129
04:18:11,000 --> 04:18:14,000
But you just need to do everything perfect

3130
04:18:15,000 --> 04:18:17,000
And at least close to it

3131
04:18:23,000 --> 04:18:26,000
I missed it and I just bad this threw me off big time

3132
04:18:31,000 --> 04:18:33,000
It double teamed

3133
04:18:34,000 --> 04:18:36,000
You want some of this too?

3134
04:18:36,000 --> 04:18:38,000
No, no, no, no, what do I think?

3135
04:18:38,000 --> 04:18:40,000
I don't be a fucking idiot

3136
04:18:40,000 --> 04:18:42,000
Just watch him

3137
04:18:42,000 --> 04:18:44,000
Watch out for that

3138
04:18:44,000 --> 04:18:46,000
Here comes another one he's gonna throw it down right now

3139
04:18:46,000 --> 04:18:48,000
I can't even

3140
04:18:50,000 --> 04:18:53,000
I just, I just, I haven't gotten there in a long time

3141
04:18:53,000 --> 04:18:56,000
I just got, I forgot that's what, yeah I forgot

3142
04:18:56,000 --> 04:18:58,000
I just 100% forgot

3143
04:18:59,000 --> 04:19:00,000
That it was like that

3144
04:19:00,000 --> 04:19:02,000
I don't know why

3145
04:19:02,000 --> 04:19:04,000
I'm getting tired

3146
04:19:04,000 --> 04:19:06,000
I'm not getting fucking tired

3147
04:19:07,000 --> 04:19:10,000
You tell when you're getting tired when

3148
04:19:10,000 --> 04:19:12,000
You're forgetting things that happened like three minutes ago

3149
04:19:13,000 --> 04:19:15,000
That's the way you know

3150
04:19:19,000 --> 04:19:22,000
God, stop throwing so many, I hate when they do that shit

3151
04:19:23,000 --> 04:19:25,000
Yeah, you can't take the cloud but

3152
04:19:25,000 --> 04:19:27,000
It's getting up there is the issue

3153
04:19:29,000 --> 04:19:32,000
Because all the flames that are coming up and he's throwing shit down

3154
04:19:32,000 --> 04:19:37,000
All the while you're trying to not, you're trying to do those jumps and avoid getting hit

3155
04:19:37,000 --> 04:19:41,000
It's just a lot for your brain to have to do it the same time

3156
04:19:43,000 --> 04:19:44,000
Oh my god

3157
04:19:50,000 --> 04:19:52,000
Yeah, you can go the easy way but

3158
04:19:52,000 --> 04:19:56,000
I don't know, I feel like I've been doing it like this way so much

3159
04:19:57,000 --> 04:19:59,000
Somewhat reliably getting past the hammer brothers

3160
04:19:59,000 --> 04:20:01,000
Until very recently

3161
04:20:03,000 --> 04:20:05,000
I'm getting, I'm getting too sloppy

3162
04:20:09,000 --> 04:20:13,000
So I figured out why only three percent of people have ever beaten this level

3163
04:20:14,000 --> 04:20:15,000
I figured it out

3164
04:20:15,000 --> 04:20:16,000
Here's what it is

3165
04:20:17,000 --> 04:20:20,000
You do it like this many times and then you just go like this

3166
04:20:21,000 --> 04:20:23,000
I don't fucking care and you quit

3167
04:20:24,000 --> 04:20:26,000
I'm not gonna do that at all

3168
04:20:34,000 --> 04:20:36,000
Yeah, I have to beat this to go to bed

3169
04:20:36,000 --> 04:20:38,000
This is my sleep ticket

3170
04:20:39,000 --> 04:20:41,000
You know, because this is my sleep ticket

3171
04:20:41,000 --> 04:20:42,000
I'm just gonna go in this way

3172
04:20:47,000 --> 04:20:48,000
Forget what happened

3173
04:20:48,000 --> 04:20:50,000
You don't even skip the hammer brothers over here

3174
04:20:50,000 --> 04:20:52,000
That actually was more work to do that

3175
04:20:53,000 --> 04:20:55,000
Yeah

3176
04:21:04,000 --> 04:21:07,000
Yeah, forget that it's not easier going that way

3177
04:21:08,000 --> 04:21:09,000
It's just longer

3178
04:21:09,000 --> 04:21:11,000
I mean you get to mushroom but

3179
04:21:11,000 --> 04:21:13,000
I'll just try to get it over with

3180
04:21:14,000 --> 04:21:26,000
It's just this is like no opportunity to jump through that it

3181
04:21:26,000 --> 04:21:30,000
The opportunity to go through there is so small

3182
04:21:30,000 --> 04:21:33,000
Maybe it is, yeah, it is, I'm still dead

3183
04:21:36,000 --> 04:21:38,000
I'm just, I'm gonna get the mushroom too

3184
04:21:38,000 --> 04:21:43,000
Because like the 2% chance to get through those hammer brothers

3185
04:21:43,000 --> 04:21:45,000
It's seriously not fucking good

3186
04:21:45,000 --> 04:21:48,000
I can just go through it every time if I just take this

3187
04:22:01,000 --> 04:22:03,000
I just, I gotta remember when they are

3188
04:22:03,000 --> 04:22:05,000
When they come up, fuck

3189
04:22:06,000 --> 04:22:09,000
If I didn't break that, I wouldn't have freaked out about it

3190
04:22:11,000 --> 04:22:13,000
That he has to die

3191
04:22:13,000 --> 04:22:16,000
Immediately otherwise it's never gonna happen

3192
04:22:16,000 --> 04:22:19,000
Like right when I get down here

3193
04:22:19,000 --> 04:22:21,000
And I get past the hammer brothers

3194
04:22:21,000 --> 04:22:23,000
This dude's got to die

3195
04:22:24,000 --> 04:22:26,000
Like, is this second example too?

3196
04:22:26,000 --> 04:22:27,000
Shit

3197
04:22:36,000 --> 04:22:38,000
Oh, it's 3% of attempts, not 3% of people

3198
04:22:38,000 --> 04:22:41,000
But still that's still a fucking tiny number

3199
04:22:42,000 --> 04:22:43,000
That's even worse

3200
04:22:46,000 --> 04:22:47,000
3% of attempts means that

3201
04:22:47,000 --> 04:22:50,000
But just potentially like thousands of attempts at this level

3202
04:22:55,000 --> 04:22:58,000
That one has hit me so many times I just keep trying to get through

3203
04:23:00,000 --> 04:23:01,000
How did he get this level again?

3204
04:23:01,000 --> 04:23:03,000
I wanna beat it before I go to sleep

3205
04:23:05,000 --> 04:23:07,000
I'm gonna difficult at a shit head level

3206
04:23:09,000 --> 04:23:11,000
I'm not getting the mushroom this time, whatever

3207
04:23:13,000 --> 04:23:15,000
I'm gonna do it with pure luck

3208
04:23:16,000 --> 04:23:18,000
No, I'm in trouble now

3209
04:23:22,000 --> 04:23:23,000
I'm in trouble

3210
04:23:24,000 --> 04:23:26,000
I had to go there but those stupid flames

3211
04:23:28,000 --> 04:23:29,000
Ah, the flames man

3212
04:23:32,000 --> 04:23:33,000
All right, it's time to go

3213
04:23:35,000 --> 04:23:42,000
Yeah, I played the level with a 0% clear, right? That sucked

3214
04:23:42,000 --> 04:23:44,000
I was on it for like an hour and 12 minutes

3215
04:23:48,000 --> 04:23:50,000
That level fucking ate shit

3216
04:23:58,000 --> 04:23:59,000
All right, he's gonna

3217
04:23:59,000 --> 04:24:01,000
I don't know, I don't know what happened

3218
04:24:02,000 --> 04:24:04,000
Why did I do like a little jump there?

3219
04:24:04,000 --> 04:24:07,000
I just got like stuck on the pee thing? What the fuck is that?

3220
04:24:10,000 --> 04:24:11,000
That should not have happened

3221
04:24:23,000 --> 04:24:25,000
Jump it over, that shit

3222
04:24:31,000 --> 04:24:32,000
No, I've screwed that

3223
04:24:39,000 --> 04:24:40,000
Let's get it

3224
04:24:44,000 --> 04:24:46,000
There's not much more after this though

3225
04:24:47,000 --> 04:24:49,000
I mean, there's a little bit but not a whole lot

3226
04:24:54,000 --> 04:24:56,000
No, I was gonna go right there, that was a good opportunity

3227
04:25:02,000 --> 04:25:03,000
Whatever, screw it, just go

3228
04:25:08,000 --> 04:25:09,000
God

3229
04:25:19,000 --> 04:25:25,000
Those flames are in a position where they're extremely difficult to avoid because you have to land there it seems

3230
04:25:27,000 --> 04:25:28,000
Get over here

3231
04:25:30,000 --> 04:25:31,000
Fuck you

3232
04:25:32,000 --> 04:25:34,000
Fuck everything you stand for

3233
04:25:40,000 --> 04:25:42,000
I don't have to worry about that guy anymore

3234
04:25:56,000 --> 04:25:58,000
I just had no opportunity to go anywhere

3235
04:25:58,000 --> 04:26:00,000
Oh, it's again, it hit me again

3236
04:26:02,000 --> 04:26:03,000
Oh

3237
04:26:09,000 --> 04:26:11,000
I split already

3238
04:26:20,000 --> 04:26:22,000
I seriously didn't even do that

3239
04:26:22,000 --> 04:26:24,000
I looked down again

3240
04:26:26,000 --> 04:26:30,000
This shit is gonna try to be fucking crazy

3241
04:26:31,000 --> 04:26:34,000
I'm going to legit lose by fucking mind playing this game

3242
04:26:37,000 --> 04:26:39,000
I'm gonna wait for this dumb shithead to come back

3243
04:26:41,000 --> 04:26:42,000
Fuck your cloud

3244
04:26:43,000 --> 04:26:47,000
You could get in it but I keep telling him in the worst possible spot

3245
04:26:51,000 --> 04:26:53,000
Well, I didn't hold down B all enough

3246
04:26:54,000 --> 04:26:57,000
I'm just unraveling at this point

3247
04:27:02,000 --> 04:27:07,000
I got a kill him right here

3248
04:27:11,000 --> 04:27:14,000
Actually, wait, wait, what the fuck star?

3249
04:27:14,000 --> 04:27:15,000
The star in there?

3250
04:27:18,000 --> 04:27:20,000
Holy shit, how do I get in there?

3251
04:27:22,000 --> 04:27:23,000
Oh my god

3252
04:27:24,000 --> 04:27:25,000
Give me that thing

3253
04:27:29,000 --> 04:27:30,000
You serious?

3254
04:27:31,000 --> 04:27:32,000
I'm getting that

3255
04:27:40,000 --> 04:27:41,000
That's actually kinda hard to get

3256
04:27:43,000 --> 04:27:45,000
Oh dear, I know what to jump

3257
04:27:47,000 --> 04:27:48,000
It's bright

3258
04:27:49,000 --> 04:27:50,000
No

3259
04:27:51,000 --> 04:27:52,000
Close

3260
04:28:02,000 --> 04:28:06,000
That moment when you realize that the chat's been saying forever

3261
04:28:06,000 --> 04:28:09,000
Well, it's kinda hard to see chat because it's on my eye

3262
04:28:09,000 --> 04:28:12,000
Because I'm facing away from my computer right now

3263
04:28:12,000 --> 04:28:16,000
So I have my iPad sitting on my lap right now

3264
04:28:16,000 --> 04:28:17,000
That's how I'm reading chat

3265
04:28:17,000 --> 04:28:20,000
Because I'm facing away from my desk

3266
04:28:22,000 --> 04:28:24,000
I've gotta figure this pattern out

3267
04:28:25,000 --> 04:28:27,000
Thought it was like that

3268
04:28:27,000 --> 04:28:29,000
It is, I just have to go faster

3269
04:28:32,000 --> 04:28:34,000
I could, yeah, I could just get the mushroom too

3270
04:28:34,000 --> 04:28:35,000
I'll try that

3271
04:28:37,000 --> 04:28:38,000
Just jump up and get it

3272
04:28:41,000 --> 04:28:42,000
Let's try that

3273
04:28:48,000 --> 04:28:51,000
Yeah, I'm definitely getting away too tired to play this game

3274
04:28:52,000 --> 04:28:55,000
I was looking for the blue thing to jump on

3275
04:28:55,000 --> 04:28:59,000
That's like how like just tired and just done playing this game I am

3276
04:29:00,000 --> 04:29:02,000
I'm sleepy as all shit

3277
04:29:03,000 --> 04:29:04,000
Okay, we're here

3278
04:29:04,000 --> 04:29:06,000
I'm more excuses

3279
04:29:16,000 --> 04:29:17,000
Let's go

3280
04:29:25,000 --> 04:29:27,000
Hey, can you guys guess what happened there?

3281
04:29:27,000 --> 04:29:29,000
I forgot about the end again

3282
04:29:29,000 --> 04:29:31,000
Because I hadn't been there in so long

3283
04:29:31,000 --> 04:29:33,000
But that's easy enough to do it

3284
04:29:35,000 --> 04:29:37,000
I'm just for about six hours or something

3285
04:29:37,000 --> 04:29:38,000
Have a night, thank god

3286
04:29:38,000 --> 04:29:40,000
My brain's doing explode

3287
04:29:53,000 --> 04:29:55,000
I'm so fucking tired

3288
04:29:55,000 --> 04:29:56,000
I just wanna be done with it

3289
04:29:58,000 --> 04:30:00,000
I'm so sleepy

3290
04:30:04,000 --> 04:30:07,000
I gotta fucking long day tomorrow too

3291
04:30:07,000 --> 04:30:11,000
I gotta wake up, wake up at like seven o'clock in the morning

3292
04:30:14,000 --> 04:30:16,000
There's like a construction guy gonna be here

3293
04:30:16,000 --> 04:30:18,000
And then tip of the hats is all day

3294
04:30:18,000 --> 04:30:20,000
Why am I doing this right now?

3295
04:30:20,000 --> 04:30:24,000
I have like extremely important busy things to do tomorrow

3296
04:30:25,000 --> 04:30:29,000
And I'm playing a 3% completion rate fucking Mario Maker game

3297
04:30:30,000 --> 04:30:33,000
Like what the hell am I doing?

3298
04:30:40,000 --> 04:30:42,000
Oh god, I hit the wall

3299
04:30:43,000 --> 04:30:44,000
Ah

3300
04:30:51,000 --> 04:30:54,000
Just like one eye is closed and shit

3301
04:30:54,000 --> 04:30:56,000
Okay, wake up, wake the fuck up

3302
04:30:56,000 --> 04:30:58,000
It's time to get this like done

3303
04:30:59,000 --> 04:31:01,000
Get there, who cares?

3304
04:31:01,000 --> 04:31:02,000
Just get through that

3305
04:31:02,000 --> 04:31:03,000
No, I just...

3306
04:31:04,000 --> 04:31:07,000
I'm gonna frisbee my iPad into my wall

3307
04:31:08,000 --> 04:31:11,000
I'm gonna take a fucking professional frisbee

3308
04:31:12,000 --> 04:31:13,000
Move

3309
04:31:13,000 --> 04:31:15,000
And it's going straight through the drywall

3310
04:31:15,000 --> 04:31:17,000
I'll never find it, it's just gonna go in

3311
04:31:17,000 --> 04:31:19,000
I'll never find it again

3312
04:31:24,000 --> 04:31:26,000
I'm gonna chat

3313
04:31:27,000 --> 04:31:28,000
I'm gonna chat

3314
04:31:40,000 --> 04:31:43,000
Alright, slow it down

3315
04:31:45,000 --> 04:31:47,000
Kill this fucking asshole, oh he flew away from me

3316
04:31:51,000 --> 04:31:54,000
What an iPad gamer, I've just...

3317
04:31:54,000 --> 04:31:56,000
Uhh...

3318
04:31:59,000 --> 04:32:02,000
What I was making like a level, why did I decide to do it?

3319
04:32:02,000 --> 04:32:04,000
I don't know why I decided to do this level

3320
04:32:04,000 --> 04:32:07,000
I wanted to do this for some dumb reason

3321
04:32:08,000 --> 04:32:11,000
And this is so easy too, it's just up so dumb

3322
04:32:14,000 --> 04:32:17,000
I was done like two hours ago

3323
04:32:21,000 --> 04:32:23,000
Fuck you, give me your cloud

3324
04:32:25,000 --> 04:32:28,000
Get outta here

3325
04:32:30,000 --> 04:32:32,000
Give me out of the cloud

3326
04:32:33,000 --> 04:32:36,000
Mario, please get out of the cloud

3327
04:32:45,000 --> 04:32:49,000
This is this, this is this, this is more to this, this is a lot more

3328
04:32:55,000 --> 04:32:57,000
Come on, come over here

3329
04:32:57,000 --> 04:32:59,000
Shouldn't have gotten that tall

3330
04:33:04,000 --> 04:33:06,000
Oh my god

3331
04:33:08,000 --> 04:33:11,000
That's the end right there, that's literally the end

3332
04:33:11,000 --> 04:33:13,000
That's the first time I'd ever seen that

3333
04:33:15,000 --> 04:33:17,000
At least I know that's the end

3334
04:33:19,000 --> 04:33:22,000
I have no idea what's happening there, but I know it's the end

3335
04:33:25,000 --> 04:33:33,000
Because it has the knife, the big knife

3336
04:33:41,000 --> 04:33:43,000
Here we go again

3337
04:33:43,000 --> 04:33:45,000
Oh what, what's this?

3338
04:33:46,000 --> 04:33:49,000
Ah yeah, I'll take that, absolutely

3339
04:33:55,000 --> 04:33:59,000
Alright, here we go again, this one wasn't terrible

3340
04:33:59,000 --> 04:34:02,000
Although how am I supposed to get through this without getting hit?

3341
04:34:02,000 --> 04:34:05,000
Besides like jumping up and jumping up

3342
04:34:05,000 --> 04:34:07,000
Yeah, that's how you do it

3343
04:34:07,000 --> 04:34:09,000
Okay, I don't know what this guy does

3344
04:34:15,000 --> 04:34:16,000
Wait, what?

3345
04:34:17,000 --> 04:34:19,000
Do I have to get him to hit into this wall?

3346
04:34:20,000 --> 04:34:24,000
I just need to know if that's what's happening or not

3347
04:34:25,000 --> 04:34:27,000
Don't worry, I died there intentionally

3348
04:34:27,000 --> 04:34:30,000
I was just seeing what I'm trying to figure out what the hell he does

3349
04:34:42,000 --> 04:34:46,000
I'm going to assume that that's what it is

3350
04:34:50,000 --> 04:34:52,000
Get that again

3351
04:34:55,000 --> 04:34:58,000
Alright, what the fuck does that guy do?

3352
04:35:01,000 --> 04:35:03,000
What the hell, what's this?

3353
04:35:03,000 --> 04:35:08,000
Oh god, that's the level being completed right there

3354
04:35:08,000 --> 04:35:11,000
Okay, I just didn't even realize what the hell was happening

3355
04:35:20,000 --> 04:35:23,000
I'm just going to push the P block

3356
04:35:26,000 --> 04:35:29,000
Oh, I get it, I get it

3357
04:35:29,000 --> 04:35:32,000
I see, alright, I understand no

3358
04:35:32,000 --> 04:35:33,000
I understand

3359
04:35:35,000 --> 04:35:37,000
I understand

3360
04:35:37,000 --> 04:35:40,000
There's just the P block, just keep falling

3361
04:35:40,000 --> 04:35:41,000
I get it

3362
04:35:41,000 --> 04:35:43,000
You just got to keep hitting him

3363
04:35:43,000 --> 04:35:45,000
Makes sense

3364
04:35:50,000 --> 04:35:56,000
That's the first time I've died of that guy for obvious reasons

3365
04:36:05,000 --> 04:36:07,000
It'd be nice to take the three hits too

3366
04:36:09,000 --> 04:36:12,000
I have no idea what the fuck I was doing there

3367
04:36:14,000 --> 04:36:16,000
Nothing smart, that's for sure

3368
04:36:20,000 --> 04:36:24,000
Nothing smart, that is for sure

3369
04:36:31,000 --> 04:36:34,000
Don't take unnecessary damage for no reason, please

3370
04:36:37,000 --> 04:36:39,000
Let's not mess this up

3371
04:36:42,000 --> 04:36:44,000
Come on

3372
04:36:50,000 --> 04:36:52,000
I'm waiting for the fire

3373
04:37:02,000 --> 04:37:05,000
Actually, I shouldn't have stepped on that, that was stupid

3374
04:37:07,000 --> 04:37:09,000
Well, fire, fire, fire

3375
04:37:20,000 --> 04:37:25,000
Ah, the fire, I forgot about the fucking fire again

3376
04:37:33,000 --> 04:37:36,000
I thought he was going up

3377
04:37:36,000 --> 04:37:38,000
I really seriously thought he was going up

3378
04:37:38,000 --> 04:37:40,000
And not coming straight down like that

3379
04:37:42,000 --> 04:37:44,000
Well, I got both their patterns

3380
04:37:44,000 --> 04:37:47,000
This should be over very soon

3381
04:37:48,000 --> 04:37:51,000
And I use that term very, very loosely

3382
04:37:53,000 --> 04:37:55,000
And then I can go to bed

3383
04:38:01,000 --> 04:38:03,000
I overshot that big time

3384
04:38:06,000 --> 04:38:08,000
Ah, fuck

3385
04:38:08,000 --> 04:38:11,000
That was very close, that was unnecessarily close

3386
04:38:14,000 --> 04:38:16,000
That was extremely unnecessary

3387
04:38:18,000 --> 04:38:20,000
Okay, wipe the hand stone

3388
04:38:25,000 --> 04:38:27,000
Wipe the hand stone

3389
04:38:30,000 --> 04:38:33,000
It's easy, there's no reason they're sprinting around all over the place

3390
04:38:33,000 --> 04:38:35,000
They have very, very, very manageable patterns

3391
04:38:40,000 --> 04:38:42,000
And this lasts a long time

3392
04:38:44,000 --> 04:38:46,000
Easy peasy

3393
04:38:48,000 --> 04:38:50,000
Easy peasy

3394
04:38:50,000 --> 04:38:52,000
Easy peasy

3395
04:38:58,000 --> 04:39:00,000
I didn't know when the fire was happening

3396
04:39:12,000 --> 04:39:14,000
Fire, fuck, no

3397
04:39:15,000 --> 04:39:17,000
Oh my god, damn it

3398
04:39:17,000 --> 04:39:19,000
It's a fucking tedious

3399
04:39:23,000 --> 04:39:27,000
You know, I died in the exact same spot, probably the last time

3400
04:39:31,000 --> 04:39:34,000
You do that like six times, that sucks

3401
04:39:38,000 --> 04:39:43,000
Do you look at how I've just become so like mesmerized that I'm just doing this

3402
04:39:43,000 --> 04:39:47,000
I'm not even playing the game right now, my muscle memories is doing this part again

3403
04:39:52,000 --> 04:39:54,000
I'm gonna beat this guy, don't worry

3404
04:40:04,000 --> 04:40:06,000
They're both a secret door

3405
04:40:06,000 --> 04:40:09,000
There's no secret door, that secret door is not real

3406
04:40:10,000 --> 04:40:13,000
It's the fire that's screwing me up

3407
04:40:18,000 --> 04:40:21,000
Let's keep, better remember, no these two are shit heads

3408
04:40:21,000 --> 04:40:23,000
Don't forget about the fire

3409
04:40:29,000 --> 04:40:30,000
I'm gonna get hit

3410
04:40:31,000 --> 04:40:33,000
Yeah, I'm gonna keep shit now

3411
04:40:40,000 --> 04:40:41,000
I'm gonna get hit

3412
04:40:43,000 --> 04:40:45,000
I'm gonna get hit

3413
04:40:48,000 --> 04:40:52,000
There's just a random random random random random random directions that they go

3414
04:40:54,000 --> 04:40:56,000
They just have to go, it's in the fire too

3415
04:40:58,000 --> 04:40:59,000
So close

3416
04:41:00,000 --> 04:41:02,000
I'm so close to defeating this

3417
04:41:10,000 --> 04:41:13,000
I'm so glad I didn't do this anymore

3418
04:41:13,000 --> 04:41:16,000
I can try to get better at the next part

3419
04:41:16,000 --> 04:41:20,000
I can pick the flower up, you dumbass

3420
04:41:20,000 --> 04:41:25,000
God, do I have to be such a dumbass sometimes, seriously

3421
04:41:29,000 --> 04:41:32,000
I'll get it right, well, let me screw up

3422
04:41:32,000 --> 04:41:34,000
I just like to know if that was it right there

3423
04:41:34,000 --> 04:41:36,000
Alright, I need to move, I need to put in the iPad down

3424
04:41:36,000 --> 04:41:38,000
Get this shit off my lap

3425
04:41:38,000 --> 04:41:40,000
Let me sit forward

3426
04:41:40,000 --> 04:41:42,000
And let's go

3427
04:42:06,000 --> 04:42:09,000
Fuck you game

3428
04:42:36,000 --> 04:42:38,000
God, that was...

3429
04:43:00,000 --> 04:43:02,000
You guys ready to go to bed?

3430
04:43:06,000 --> 04:43:08,000
Oh boy

3431
04:43:10,000 --> 04:43:12,000
Yay

3432
04:43:12,000 --> 04:43:14,000
I beat Mr. Chomsdoghouse

3433
04:43:24,000 --> 04:43:26,000
What do the people say?

3434
04:43:26,000 --> 04:43:28,000
What do the people say?

3435
04:43:28,000 --> 04:43:30,000
Let's see what they say

3436
04:43:37,000 --> 04:43:39,000
Like I said

3437
04:43:43,000 --> 04:43:46,000
Um, I'm here to thank you

3438
04:43:46,000 --> 04:43:50,000
You just killed my Mario 100 run but in high-level

3439
04:43:53,000 --> 04:43:55,000
See, in 15 years, fun

3440
04:43:55,000 --> 04:43:57,000
Awesome, final boss

3441
04:43:57,000 --> 04:43:59,000
Go up if you want to have an easier time

3442
04:44:01,000 --> 04:44:04,000
This poor guy, this poor guy got his 100 run killed

3443
04:44:07,000 --> 04:44:10,000
Okay, well there is the number if you need it

3444
04:44:14,000 --> 04:44:16,000
That was really cool

3445
04:44:16,000 --> 04:44:18,000
That was really fun

3446
04:44:18,000 --> 04:44:20,000
If you think that a

3447
04:44:21,000 --> 04:44:23,000
Torture is fun

3448
04:44:27,000 --> 04:44:29,000
By Cuddly

3449
04:44:29,000 --> 04:44:31,000
Oh

3450
04:44:31,000 --> 04:44:33,000
Alright guys

3451
04:44:33,000 --> 04:44:37,000
Now, it's like funny now that I look back at this level

3452
04:44:37,000 --> 04:44:41,000
It's actually very, very easy once you know exactly what's happening

3453
04:44:41,000 --> 04:44:44,000
But that's the problem with all these levels is like

3454
04:44:44,000 --> 04:44:48,000
I died a million times on things that I just didn't understand

3455
04:44:54,000 --> 04:44:57,000
I just want to see one thing

3456
04:44:57,000 --> 04:45:01,000
Oh, it's a featured

3457
04:45:04,000 --> 04:45:07,000
One shell

3458
04:45:11,000 --> 04:45:13,000
Yeah, it's funny looking back like I'm like

3459
04:45:13,000 --> 04:45:15,000
How did I not beat that? Like I'm my first try

3460
04:45:15,000 --> 04:45:17,000
Which is he's

3461
04:45:17,000 --> 04:45:21,000
You have no idea what the hell is going on and shit is flying all over the place

3462
04:45:21,000 --> 04:45:23,000
This is a really fun game though look at this one

3463
04:45:23,000 --> 04:45:26,000
Look at this level, what is even happening here

3464
04:45:26,000 --> 04:45:31,000
This is not, I'm not attempting to beat this or anything, I just, I'm curious

3465
04:45:33,000 --> 04:45:35,000
Let's see what it is

3466
04:45:39,000 --> 04:45:41,000
Dude here

3467
04:45:47,000 --> 04:45:49,000
Okay, that leads to nothing

3468
04:45:52,000 --> 04:45:54,000
Probably need to jump off his head

3469
04:45:56,000 --> 04:45:57,000
No

3470
04:46:03,000 --> 04:46:05,000
I'm kind of confused by this level

3471
04:46:09,000 --> 04:46:11,000
I think it is

3472
04:46:13,000 --> 04:46:15,000
Oh shit, okay

3473
04:46:17,000 --> 04:46:18,000
Oh

3474
04:46:18,000 --> 04:46:21,000
Alright guys, I'm gonna take off

3475
04:46:21,000 --> 04:46:23,000
Thanks for watching

3476
04:46:23,000 --> 04:46:26,000
If you're new, if you just found this stream

3477
04:46:26,000 --> 04:46:29,000
I'm real fucking goddamn sorry

3478
04:46:30,000 --> 04:46:32,000
That you had to watch that

3479
04:46:32,000 --> 04:46:35,000
Maybe fail miserably over and over again at this game

3480
04:46:35,000 --> 04:46:37,000
Yeah

3481
04:46:37,000 --> 04:46:40,000
Hi, my name is Jeremiah

3482
04:46:40,000 --> 04:46:42,000
But for the rest of you

3483
04:46:42,000 --> 04:46:43,000
Take care of these guys

3484
04:46:43,000 --> 04:46:46,000
See most of you at Tip of the Hats tomorrow

3485
04:46:46,000 --> 04:46:49,000
I think I'll be there at

3486
04:46:51,000 --> 04:46:54,000
Either one or four I think is what I'm gonna be starting on it

3487
04:46:55,000 --> 04:46:57,000
Yeah, good night guys

3488
04:46:57,000 --> 04:46:59,000
Have a wonderful, wonderful evening

3489
04:46:59,000 --> 04:47:02,000
Rest of your night, rest of your day, whatever, wherever we are

3490
04:47:02,000 --> 04:47:03,000
Good night

3491
04:47:03,000 --> 04:47:04,000
Goodbye

3492
04:47:04,000 --> 04:47:06,000
Good bye

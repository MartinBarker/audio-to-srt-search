1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
But one last stop-long in the mark, Flats.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Alicia will meet you there.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Get moving. Beat the ratmen to it.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Ha-ha!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're already in a game, I guess.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're blessed.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Help!

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Where are we?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Up here!

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Whereup that way?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
My ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Just a moment.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
To the New Year's Eve, Caltown Street!

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Damn, they're definitely in this area.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Whoa, it was the drag.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's got thrown into this game.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I don't even know what's happening.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
All I know is I just got tossed in here.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I went to matchmaking and all of a sudden in somebody's game.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
They're everywhere.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to go to the New Year's Eve.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah, I would have done like a more proper intro, but...

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's got sucked in here.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hi! Hi guys! Hello!

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Welcome to my New Year's Eve, Caltown Street!

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I wanted to do this, so that'll be fun to, like, Caltown the New Year.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
At least East Coast.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Gatlin' Gunnar.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's up here.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We're for East Coast.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This is Burmentide.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Burmentide.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Gunnar played it before.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's kind of like Leffordead.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Holy shit.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No!

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
All right, if you ever played Leffordead,

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
it's Leffordead with rats.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's pretty much all you need to know.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Happy New Year to those of you that have had the New Year go by already.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But, uh, also the East Coast still has quite a little bit of ways, like an hour or so, till, uh, until we can count accounts.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This game has a pleasantly surprised me though.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I held off installing this game for, like, at least a month or two.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
All right, get the star subsound out of your system.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The game is a bit of an off-the-sounding video.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's a bit of a shame to be honest with you.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm just going to be a bit honest with you.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're gonna have to be honest with me.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm just going to be honest with you.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm just going to be honest with you.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Alright, yeah, get the star sub sound out of your system.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah, we all heard it.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It was really funny.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Star makes the funniest jokes, right?

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And by funniest jokes, I mean, he just like insults me,

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and that's it.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Good joke.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Good jokes, Star.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Really good punchline.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm okay on health.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And nobody wants to mention the fact that he didn't stream for a month.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No, no, it's all, it's all gonna be about how Jerma sucks, right?

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh shit.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He's a fucking joke, Star.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll tell you that.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't even want to play this character.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't play the dwarf guy.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I've never seen this in a healer.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's not easy.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I thought it was only normal or hard.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know if I'm just gonna stream Verman Tide for a while.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh dear.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hey, what left for dead bodies this?

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Get it out of your system.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Go ahead, get it out of your system.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's hear it.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I mean, I was just freaking out right there.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, jeez, jeb!

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Where the fuck did he come from?

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What the fuck?

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh my god.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm just stuck up here.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't want to jump out there.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Bye-bye.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Holy shit, I'm still alive.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Geez.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, what the fuck an assassin, red?

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No, I don't want to do that.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We gotta hit this big motherfucker out of here.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I like this arrow because it bounces around everybody.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Can I hit him right in his face?

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Whoa.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We have a decade of uninterrupted practice.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No, not even there.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You know, I could address, I want to.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I've been very silent about it.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I've been very quiet about it.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Because I have to be.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Everybody wants to talk about the German wrestling.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And God, guys, me too.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I really do.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But I can't.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I just can't.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Jess, Jess, be patient.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's all I can say is it's not going to happen in 2015.

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You just gotta be patient.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You gotta trust me on this one.

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay, you gotta trust me.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Be patient.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And your patience will pay off.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I hope.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Maybe.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Do we have any like tubes, generally?

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is called vermin tide.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That is great.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I need to move one.

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm not like in a...

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, somebody got a loop die.

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Sorry, this is going to make a little bit of noise.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Hopefully it's not too loud when I move this around.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll put on a good jump down.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Ugh.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Only grimness all right.

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This isn't going well.

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But I like this game a lot.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This game sort of flew a little bit under the radar.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It wasn't one of those games that a bunch of people were talking about.

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I think people were talking about it.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But it's just fun to play.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
How did I know it hit him?

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's good just to walk around and slash a bunch of rats, you know?

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This one.

134
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Are we going to move?

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I would say if you really want to know when...

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
When Jerma Rumble 4 is coming out,

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
the only thing I can tell you is probably spring 2016.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Very, very, I don't know.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But like it'll...

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Trust me when I say that it'll...

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Hopefully it's worth it.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I hope it's fucking worth it.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It is a Warhammer game.

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It is a Warhammer End Times.

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What let him know?

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What level of my will you are right now?

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I've only not completed one.

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I didn't beat the last campaign yet.

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh shit, that's not good.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Where are they coming from?

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Ooh, that was a double...

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm not very good with this character.

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Because it's...

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm not going to hit headshots with the bow.

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This is very quick.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But this is actually the balance around arrow.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll show you guys my items when I get a second after the start.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
When I get a moment or two.

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What character is other in this game?

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, there's five classes.

161
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There are five...

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What the...

163
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Flying fuck.

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
These...

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Why was he shooting me?

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Get away.

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I am in deep shit.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I gotta stay back.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I have to stay away back.

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Nothing about it.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Another Gatlin gunner rat?

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You serious?

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You still alive?

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh my god.

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh god, this is not good.

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is not good.

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The gas rat is just fucking this all up.

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No, why is the gunner going that way?

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Go that way, thank god.

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If I could touch three in a second on dead.

181
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh boy, I can't...

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I think this might be done deal.

183
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Maybe not.

184
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, I'm alive.

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I actually have been playing TF2.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I've been playing the tough break.

187
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Campaign stuff.

188
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's been fun.

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't know if I'll stream that tonight, but...

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
In all seriousness, this game is supposed to be this similar to Left 4 Dead.

191
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I guess.

192
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I would say that this is as close to Left 4 Dead 3 as you could possibly get without it being Left 4 Dead 3.

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Like, take Left 4 Dead and rewind it into Medieval times with some magic shit.

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It is Left 4 Dead.

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But it has an item system, which you like kind of craft items, you roll for items, and it is.

196
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We'll see.

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I really could use that.

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And so could you, but I grabbed it first, so I'm drinking it.

199
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This much burns my throat.

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Ugh.

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I wish you were an ION.

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Uh-oh.

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's getting grabbed by a stick rat.

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't close me out of here.

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What the hell?

206
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
How much is it cost? I think it is currently on sale for 15% off.

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I think it's $25 or whatever your...

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Whatever $25 American dollars is for you or whatever it is.

209
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I wish I was the voice for the rats in this game, though.

210
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It'd be awesome.

211
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I would love to be the rats.

212
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Uh, is anybody... Yeah, give that to the cast or yeah.

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You drink that.

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Mm, yummy, yummy.

215
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What time is it? It is like 11.30?

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
11.40?

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We're gonna... What count down the new year guys? We are counting down the new year.

218
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We're gonna do a big count. I'm gonna put a big count down on screen and shit.

219
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's gonna be awesome.

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I got a party hat specifically to do it.

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I got one of those like...

222
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Those things you blow into.

223
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
A whistle, a horn.

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, a horn whistle.

225
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's safe to say this game is fun.

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes, if you like the left for dead formula,

227
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
there is no reason why you would not like this game.

228
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
If you get a couple of your bodies and you jump in and you play

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and you guys all enjoy the left for dead formula,

230
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
there's almost no differences.

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Besides the fact that it is melee,

232
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
predominantly a melee only game with sidearms and bows.

233
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What are you living in a barn?

234
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I think we might... We're gonna defend this room for a minute.

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Are we just gonna defend this area?

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I must heal!

237
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Derm I bought you a glue man shirt. Do you love me yet? Of course I do.

238
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Come on, you even have to ask that question?

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This is a very tense music for nothing really happening.

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Watch out, watch out for the one rat.

241
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What the hell are they?

242
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm gonna...

243
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What is going on here?

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Are they all coming in this door? I guess so.

245
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I guess they're coming in the front door.

246
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What about you idiots?

247
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You gotta flank us.

248
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Auto update. I have an auto update.

249
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So those of you that have been following my Twitter

250
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
for these last week or two.

251
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Counter-ins are like a little bit of a nightmare situation with my dog.

252
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
For those of you that don't know.

253
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Hold on, I gotta get her some rest.

254
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He has Addison's disease.

255
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Just got diagnosed like this past week.

256
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I was in the vet for pretty much every single day straight last week.

257
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He was getting blood work done, he was getting test done,

258
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and all kinds of awful shit.

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And it turns out he needs to go on Fredna's own steroids for the rest of his life.

260
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And I have to give him a little squeeze out of this little syringe thing

261
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and do his mouth every day.

262
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And I have to do that for the rest of his whole life.

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But the upside is he is perfectly fine.

264
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
He has done a complete 180 from being all sorts of fucked up

265
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
to be in the dog.

266
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I know I'm a dog.

267
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He is just auto.

268
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Completely like almost 100% back to normal after doing the treatment.

269
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So that's that.

270
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's a thing.

271
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He's okay.

272
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If I could show him on camera here in a minute, I really want to.

273
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah, when we do the big countdown, I'll show auto on screen.

274
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh dear, that's a big donor guy.

275
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I have a good shot.

276
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I can't do that.

277
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I like and don't like this character.

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh shit, don't get split up.

279
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah, the doctor actually told me that with Addison's disease for dogs,

280
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
if you have a dog that is in very high stress environment,

281
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
he can get all messed up.

282
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If he had fun, he'd let thunderstorms, dogs, they'd run under the bed during a thunderstorm.

283
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
If he is that type of dog, I apparently he can have all kinds of problems

284
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
because he can't produce the court as all.

285
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So the doctor's like, make sure you don't put him in any stressful situations.

286
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You could fuck it, kill it.

287
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Well, he didn't say that, but you know, that's what I took from it.

288
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And there's a tank following us.

289
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This is not a good opportunity to get a tank and follow us.

290
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Where is it?

291
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He appeared in my face last time.

292
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And hopefully it does not do it again.

293
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh, where is he?

294
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't know.

295
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm going to pick up this egg sack.

296
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Protect me.

297
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Come on, I need some protection here.

298
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm picking up the fucking egg sack.

299
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Here we go.

300
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Keep going.

301
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Keep going.

302
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Let them just deal with the tank.

303
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I got to protect you.

304
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I have this.

305
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm going to drop one and you drop one.

306
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh boy.

307
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't look back.

308
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He's not behind us.

309
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I promise.

310
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I can't just do it a hell of a job.

311
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
He's still alive.

312
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm going to heal this guy too.

313
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Once we get done with this other one.

314
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
See?

315
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I knew the Commodity Leader had to go.

316
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Alright.

317
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Come over here.

318
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Hey, you ride it.

319
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Come here.

320
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Come here.

321
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Can I get it?

322
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh, that was...

323
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I guess that was not the cryo of the...

324
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I thought that was the...

325
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
No, it wasn't the witch on her shit.

326
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's why I look a bit.

327
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No.

328
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Where's the pack, Rhett?

329
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I got you.

330
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, you're in such a bad spot, dude.

331
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
We're going to have to get you later.

332
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Can I get him?

333
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Wait, what?

334
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh, God.

335
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No.

336
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He's bad news.

337
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't.

338
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He's bad news.

339
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
This is really bad news.

340
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah.

341
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You bring him back to life.

342
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Holy shit.

343
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That guy caught me out of mid-air.

344
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He got me in mid-fucking air.

345
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Have I had me doctor?

346
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oak is lately.

347
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I have it all the time.

348
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That rat is freaking out now, boy.

349
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
At least we killed the tag, right?

350
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Did we kill the tag?

351
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Think, there's still an assassin rat.

352
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
There he is.

353
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Shit, don't let him wrap around us.

354
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Stay together, stay together, stay together, stay together.

355
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Those winds won't close by themselves.

356
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That guy's got a healing drone.

357
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He's just drinking.

358
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Drink that shit, dude.

359
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Drink that shit.

360
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There's only two more stacks.

361
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You gotta go two by two.

362
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Or you know what?

363
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We should just do four by four then.

364
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm not going over there by myself.

365
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's a fucking terrible idea.

366
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't go over there by yourself.

367
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Don't go by yourself.

368
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Oh boy.

369
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Well, I have to come with you now.

370
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh god.

371
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Dude, I'm just distracting these dudes.

372
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Hopefully you pick up that cereal bag and get it in here.

373
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We're just kind of getting thrown into this game, like halfway through it.

374
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh, whatever mine, I spoke to soon.

375
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There is no friendly fire.

376
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Friendly fire does not exist in this game.

377
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Which is good because that would kind of be outrageous.

378
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It'd be hard to, uh...

379
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Because everyone's throwing their hands around spamming.

380
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Let's get out of here.

381
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Dermot or anyone in jail.

382
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm running out of nicknames for Pokemon.

383
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Any ideas?

384
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Ultradon.

385
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's a pretty good name.

386
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm thinking Ultradon or...

387
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Dread...

388
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Dread...

389
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Dread...

390
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Dread...

391
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Jimvonny.

392
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Ernest.

393
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
We got a couple of bonus die.

394
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Alright, so to explain this in as tiny of a way as I possibly can.

395
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You get dice.

396
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
All you have to do is you have to roll one face.

397
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Like, in principle, this doesn't have the symbols matter.

398
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You just have to roll a face up.

399
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So, the amount of face upside roll, I get either a common or an uncommon or did it for me, but okay, here we go.

400
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So that's 1, 2, 3, 4, so that's 1, 2, 3, 4.

401
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I got a green, a green bow.

402
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And...

403
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Actually, I'm kind of curious what this is.

404
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Black meadow bow, long bow.

405
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And the upgrade is increased zoom distance.

406
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Give me a second.

407
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I need to see...

408
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Where...

409
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Guys, we are...

410
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Just about 20 minutes away from New Year's Day, the big New Year, 2016, and account it down.

411
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Just about 20 minutes away.

412
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
For the big countdown.

413
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Alright, let's see.

414
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Ah, wow, yeah.

415
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So there are exactly the same.

416
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I think this bow does not have the homing trail.

417
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So the only difference is this is just a long bow.

418
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
They are identical in stats.

419
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
This one has homing.

420
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
This one does not, but it has higher...

421
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I can like, see a zoom distance.

422
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Let's just look at it.

423
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah, there we go.

424
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So it just zooms in farther.

425
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And that's not even upgraded.

426
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I can upgrade and get even further.

427
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I know, I...

428
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You kind of can get screwed sometimes.

429
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,000
When the homing arrow wants to just go wherever it wants.

430
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It's still fun to...

431
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
How many bolts?

432
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Arrows?

433
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
This has more arrows too.

434
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
This has 40 plus arrows.

435
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That 11 has 29, I think, right?

436
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Let's see.

437
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
29, so yeah, I lose like 20, just about like 15 hours,

438
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
18 hours or something, but...

439
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I don't know, something about the homing is cool.

440
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I could salvage some shit.

441
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I don't like this, we're gonna get rid of it.

442
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And we're gonna get rid of this.

443
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
28, yeah, I can make another...

444
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
common, but I don't think I want to.

445
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Have I decided on my game of the year 2015?

446
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Of course, I have Bloodborne.

447
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Of course, I have Bloodborne for sure.

448
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Although, I don't know, it's a toss-up.

449
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I might need to like hold my own award ceremony

450
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
to figure that out.

451
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Let's see, let's see what the academy thinks.

452
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Maybe I should just craft something.

453
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I don't want this, I'm gonna craft it.

454
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Fucking craft it.

455
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm not gonna use the gems to make...

456
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What do I want to make?

457
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
What character do I want to make something for?

458
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Let's go with...

459
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I like the dwarf.

460
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Let's go with whatever, let's see.

461
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Alright, what am I gonna get?

462
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Sword in the shield or Axon shield?

463
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I played the dwarf.

464
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So I currently have a blue.

465
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I did this, which is pretty good.

466
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:11,000
This is what I just got.

467
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Sometimes it's fun to be shielded, guy.

468
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What's the upgrade on it?

469
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
When hitting a man-sized enemy with a normal attack,

470
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
there is a 5-15% chance to instantly kill it.

471
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
What does that mean?

472
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Oh, thanks to all the subscribers, by the way,

473
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
all the old and new ones I haven't streamed in a while.

474
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Thanks.

475
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So a normal man-sized enemy is everybody a man-sized enemy compared to me.

476
00:26:44,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I kinda like it.

477
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'll try it.

478
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm gonna upgrade it there.

479
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I got the absolute worst I could.

480
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I got the absolute bottom.

481
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That could have been 5-15.

482
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And I got 5.

483
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
By the way, if you're wondering what like that noise in the background is,

484
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
that's my heater in this room.

485
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Oh, it's talking about the special rats, like the bigger ones.

486
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Oh, that's kinda cool.

487
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Which is what it wasn't, 5%.

488
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
That's kinda sucks.

489
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Are we doing another mission with these same dudes?

490
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
What's going on? Let's do it.

491
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Oh, wait, not as buddy. That's fine.

492
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's a trusty shotgun.

493
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Even though it just sucks, it's a regular shitty shotgun.

494
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I wanna get a legendary orange item in the game.

495
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm gonna get a new one.

496
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm gonna get a new one.

497
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Those of you guys that played this game, does anybody have?

498
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
A orange item?

499
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And if you do, is there any real big difference between the orange and non-arange?

500
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Now, like having this shield, though, you feel more involved when you're using a shield like this.

501
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So here's my axe. This is the blue axe I have.

502
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's a two-hander and it's big and it's a big swing.

503
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Giant rats.

504
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The orange items are a lot better. I wanna see one.

505
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I wanna hold one. I just wanna hold it.

506
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm just gonna hold the damper.

507
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Here we go. I am... am I ready? Alright. What do you guys think?

508
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Big blue two-hander or...

509
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Sword and Shield Protect teammates guy.

510
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I don't like this. This is how many people you can hit with a swing.

511
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
That needs to be...

512
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That's so much bigger. Is this a one-hander?

513
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I don't know. I guess I'll use the shield.

514
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
5-4-3-2-1-0.

515
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Prepare your shield.

516
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You cannot change your weapon mid-mission.

517
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You cannot change your class or your weapon.

518
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
The only time you can change is right at the very beginning.

519
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
There is an inventory.

520
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Other than that, nope.

521
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
See right here? I can change my stuff.

522
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But I'll stay with this.

523
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
At least we'll do our humus good.

524
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I shouldn't have picked the shotgun.

525
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's two close quarters.

526
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
That quest leads to temptation.

527
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I'm pretty sure I'm going to get in everybody's way.

528
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
This character is the shield on.

529
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm not sure if I can get in there.

530
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
That one felt good.

531
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That's an assassin rat.

532
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
He's still coming in.

533
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I've got to time these stuns. He's dead.

534
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I would be careful.

535
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
The garros.

536
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Damn it. He's still alive.

537
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Now we're getting a horde.

538
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Bumps any more than one.

539
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I don't split up.

540
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I caught up in this maze of a sewer we have here.

541
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
That's a patrol of armored enemies.

542
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I don't want to see that at all.

543
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
A lot of healing in here.

544
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Whoa! You shot them!

545
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I can't see it.

546
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It's like water.

547
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Let's move.

548
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Oh fuck.

549
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh god.

550
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What a perfectly timed bomb.

551
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Good work, dude.

552
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I got saved by ass.

553
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,000
They could break through my shield.

554
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get in there.

555
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm not sure if I can get in there.

556
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The vermin talk.

557
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Oh fuck. I might too little to jump this.

558
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
My little body can't jump over that.

559
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Damn it.

560
00:34:43,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I wish I had some cool emotes to show off too.

561
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm not sure if I can get in there.

562
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm not sure if I can get in there.

563
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I don't want to see that.

564
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get in there.

565
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Stay together.

566
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,000
There's the thing to spin the thing.

567
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Open the floor, Jets.

568
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
He said it.

569
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm not sure if I can get in there.

570
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Here comes the race.

571
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Oh, I just love this game.

572
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I love how it feels.

573
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm going to reload this gun.

574
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm destroyed.

575
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm just a pile of rats.

576
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I didn't get the shield up.

577
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:19,000
See you later.

578
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm going to reload this game.

579
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I have it set to 85 right now.

580
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I get a ton of vision.

581
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Somebody kill him.

582
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I think he's still alive.

583
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'll put it up.

584
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
If I put it at 90, right?

585
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Especially when you're turning corners.

586
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I get like, for some reason, I don't know what it is about this game's 90 FOV.

587
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Get him.

588
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm inhaling all the shots.

589
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Kill him.

590
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Kill the fucking rat.

591
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I know I have to heal.

592
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm sitting there taking so many hits.

593
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You're just weird.

594
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I already know that.

595
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I see it like, when I turn the camera around.

596
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm going to deal with something real quick.

597
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I'm going to deal with something real quick.

598
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:19,000
One second, I just got to let somebody else deal with something I'm going to deal with real quick.

599
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Here's what I was talking about.

600
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I see it like to the right.

601
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's almost like moving like a fisheye lens a little bit.

602
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Something about it just seems off.

603
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Give me that's mine.

604
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Guys, we are less than 10 minutes away.

605
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
From the new year countdown.

606
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Where is he?

607
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:12,000
He ran away down the hall.

608
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm going to kill him.

609
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
He's sitting on his teeth.

610
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
What was that?

611
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You're a driven man, Salt's Pire.

612
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
See that you don't interfere with it.

613
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I'll watch the machine.

614
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Oh shit.

615
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Run to the wrong.

616
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm ready to kill this guy.

617
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm going to kill him.

618
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
The assassin was still alive.

619
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm going to have a potion.

620
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm going to start using it more often.

621
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Free stuff.

622
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm going to have to do something.

623
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm going to have to do something.

624
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm going to have to do something.

625
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Get out of here.

626
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Get out of here.

627
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Drop him down.

628
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Let's do it.

629
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Open the second floodgate.

630
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Get off me.

631
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Where is the team?

632
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Open up the gate.

633
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
There we go.

634
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Open it.

635
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Pull it.

636
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Open it.

637
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
They kind of do that in this game.

638
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
That music starts to play.

639
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Run.

640
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:25,000
When they start landing.

641
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
You guys are up.

642
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Not that much further.

643
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Drop him.

644
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Drop him.

645
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Let's get the hell out of here.

646
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm going to go behind myself.

647
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Don't get jumped on.

648
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Let's go.

649
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I was just blind.

650
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I was just blind.

651
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I don't know why.

652
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Nothing no mood for the ship.

653
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I'm going to have to do something.

654
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Luke died.

655
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Luke died.

656
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
No one person can only have one last person.

657
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
They cannot be two dwarves.

658
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
They can live together.

659
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Live together.

660
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Live together.

661
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Get in the bus.

662
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Let's move.

663
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
That was a good run.

664
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
We are victorious.

665
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Let's get in the way.

666
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Three minutes away from the countdown.

667
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
We are counting down the new year.

668
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I want to get that roll.

669
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I just got so fucking destroyed right here.

670
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
One die head of face.

671
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
That's wonderful.

672
00:46:43,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I'm going to leave this game.

673
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,000
We have to count down to do.

674
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:20,000
We're putting up the countdown.

675
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:31,000
We're going to be watching that clock like a hawk.

676
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:38,000
We're down to the last two minutes.

677
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Let me go get my stuff.

678
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I got to get the camera on.

679
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Count down in one minute.

680
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Count down.

681
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Count down.

682
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Count down.

683
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Count down.

684
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Count down.

685
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Count down.

686
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Count down.

687
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Count down.

688
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Count down.

689
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Count down.

690
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Count down.

691
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Count down.

692
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Count down.

693
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Count down.

694
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Count down.

695
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Count down.

696
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Count down.

697
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Count down.

698
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Count down.

699
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Count down.

700
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Count down.

701
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Count down.

702
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Count down.

703
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Count down.

704
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Count down.

705
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Count down.

706
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Count down.

707
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Count down.

708
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Count down.

709
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Count down.

710
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Count down.

711
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Count down.

712
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Count down.

713
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Count down.

714
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Count down.

715
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Count down.

716
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Count down.

717
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Count down.

718
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Count down.

719
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Count down.

720
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Count down.

721
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I got my fucking new year robe for nothing.

722
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I bought this fucking bathroom.

723
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It's a special new year bathroom.

724
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Happy New Year everybody.

725
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Happy New Year.

726
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Hope 2016 is a good one.

727
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Let's play more vermin time.

728
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Have I just been at this loading screen the entire time?

729
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Why have I not loaded into the inn?

730
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
What is going on here?

731
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:50,000
What time is it?

732
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Come on.

733
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Blood bearing thanks for something.

734
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Hey, the 2016.

735
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Let's hope it's a good one.

736
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Right, everybody?

737
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Cheers.

738
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Let me turn off this heater.

739
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Let me figure out.

740
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:31,000
This is fucking baby toy.

741
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Shut up.

742
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Shut up, you fucking baby cell phone.

743
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Okay, what's going on?

744
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I can have to like,

745
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
and this process or something.

746
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:59,000
My whole game is crashed.

747
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Okay.

748
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Well, let me just a second here.

749
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Can I just reload the game?

750
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Whatever.

751
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I can reload it. It's fine.

752
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Why do you have batteries in a baby toy?

753
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Because I have nieces and nephews that come over here

754
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:48,000
and they need something to play with.

755
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Happy New Year.

756
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Much love.

757
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Oh, wait, for God.

758
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,000
We got the very important dog camp.

759
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I'll show you guys how to.

760
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
He's over here. He's over here.

761
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
We're going to freak show.

762
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And hey, there's a dog.

763
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
See, he's doing just fine.

764
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Hi, Otto.

765
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Otto.

766
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
He's kind of sleeping over there.

767
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
He kind of freaked out when I,

768
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
and he jumped up there.

769
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
He's lying on his little bed.

770
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And his new year bed.

771
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
M&M's beach party.

772
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
You're right.

773
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,000
What the fuck are you talking about?

774
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I don't want to play as,

775
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I guess they'll play dwarf,

776
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:15,000
big axe man.

777
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Oh, lock that up.

778
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I don't have enough to do that.

779
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Well, shit.

780
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I'm going to be.

781
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Be this guy.

782
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I like this guy.

783
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
He's fun.

784
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
He's a big two-hander man.

785
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
The gun I have for him is a very powerful single shot rifle.

786
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That takes a while to reload.

787
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
This is a very amusing.

788
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Very strong pushes armor pen.

789
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And it's very, very strong.

790
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
The normal attacks do a lot of damage.

791
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And it hits a shit load of people when you charge it up.

792
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
So let's play, right?

793
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Let's play too.

794
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I got to change my stream title.

795
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
It's got to say 2016.

796
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Gonna be a good one.

797
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
2016, come off.

798
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
We can't wait.

799
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Come on, it's going to be such a good one.

800
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:26,000
New Year's resolution.

801
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
There we go.

802
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
2016.

803
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Gonna be a good one.

804
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
There we are.

805
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
What mission do I want to do?

806
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I don't know.

807
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
About...

808
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I'll try one on hard.

809
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Actually, I haven't even beaten it.

810
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I have one mission I haven't done.

811
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I don't know if I want to do that right now.

812
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I'm not going to do that.

813
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Smugglers run the enemy below waterfront.

814
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Rengens of war.

815
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
We'll try it on hard.

816
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:30,000
We're going to get my ass kicked, put, you know, whatever, right?

817
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,000
It's fine to game.

818
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So take that as a no, we can't join you.

819
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I mean, if you just...

820
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Just queue up.

821
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
We had queue up for engines of war on hard.

822
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
There's not very many people playing the game right now.

823
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
You know what I mean?

824
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Like, just...

825
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
If you're in the game right now, just queue up for that on hard.

826
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And if you're in the United States, I'm sure I'll meet up with you.

827
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Thanks for the sub shout out.

828
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Oh, Mr. Twig, man.

829
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Welcome to the new year.

830
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Welcome to the 2016 year.

831
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I'll only reset if you finish your bio.

832
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I'll never finish my bio.

833
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It's never going to happen.

834
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I don't want anyone to know who I was.

835
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I want it to come to the channel and just be like,

836
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I'm going to bring this bio and be like, fine, buy.

837
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It doesn't have a shit here.

838
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I can't even play M&Ms Beach party, guys.

839
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
You want me to play M&Ms?

840
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
You want me to play a game for the original Nintendo Wii?

841
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
How am I supposed to hook that?

842
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I can't hook that shit up.

843
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I don't even have that in here.

844
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I think I broke that disk in half, by the way.

845
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I don't even know where it is.

846
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Just give me somewhere to donate to you.

847
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Now, unnecessary.

848
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Your subscription, or you're already subscribed.

849
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
That's good enough for me.

850
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
More than enough for me.

851
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So, thank you.

852
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Don't worry about it.

853
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Are you watching the stream?

854
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Is this guy watching the stream?

855
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I wonder.

856
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
If you're watching the stream, turn a nod.

857
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That wasn't a nod.

858
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I'm onto you.

859
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I'm onto you, you little snake.

860
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
You're going to watch the stream.

861
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
You think you can play this game and watch the stream?

862
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Don't you block it me.

863
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
All right, first person to fall off wins.

864
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I fucking won.

865
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
We said I'm late.

866
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Oh, you know.

867
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:57,000
We're gonna like hard that we're fucking hurt.

868
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Imagine how much this would hurt.

869
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Imagine just like,

870
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Hey, calm down.

871
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I said calm down.

872
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Let's do it.

873
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Turn me you dummy.

874
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
What?

875
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Why am I dummy?

876
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
What does that dude deserve to?

877
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
This is on hard.

878
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
This is gonna be hard.

879
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I want to give more money to you.

880
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Is it really so hard?

881
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I just want you to have my dollars.

882
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I don't know.

883
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It's weird.

884
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I'm gonna weird spot that.

885
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I don't know.

886
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
You guys know how I feel about that.

887
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I just like to make videos in play games and stream sometimes.

888
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I make videos and hang out.

889
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I don't like.

890
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I don't care.

891
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I don't want this.

892
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I don't want like this stream or my YouTube channel to be about how much money I can make.

893
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It's never really been about that.

894
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I know some people will say like,

895
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
What the fuck are you talking about?

896
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
What are you stupid?

897
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Yeah.

898
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I'm pretty fucking stupid.

899
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
There's nothing to do with it though.

900
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
How dare you?

901
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
There's been a new development.

902
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Ratman engineers are hard at work out in the forest.

903
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Hey everyone talking shit about me streaming?

904
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I've streamed every single day in 2016 so far.

905
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
What's that?

906
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Every single second of 2016.

907
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:59,000
How many streamers do you know that can say that they've streamed every single second of 2016?

908
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
That's tough to come by man.

909
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Well optimistic pick.

910
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Thanks for sticking around and hanging out and watching.

911
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I like that guys boys.

912
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Why?

913
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Untamed!

914
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
The acting in this game is actually really good.

915
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
They say a lot of interesting things and they're very good at it.

916
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Oh you guys are only dead?

917
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
What?

918
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Yeah!

919
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
More dead rats.

920
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Why is that like...

921
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Rat, left for dead rats edition.

922
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I'm just sniping.

923
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I like just sitting back and shooting.

924
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
It's fun.

925
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Ooh that was a headshot.

926
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I got that dude.

927
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
That was an armored guy too.

928
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I'm proud of that one.

929
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I'm very proud of that one.

930
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
That's so satisfying.

931
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
When you get the big club in the head and they explode their heads it's great.

932
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Like that.

933
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Oh whoa whoa easy.

934
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I have not tried the stage controller.

935
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I don't know if I'd even like to either.

936
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I don't really have the necessary reason why I want to use it.

937
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,000
We are getting kind of split up here.

938
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Ratling gun shit.

939
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:20,000
That was lucky.

940
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Oh he's dead.

941
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I got him.

942
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
This is actually 90 FOV believer not.

943
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Somebody asked if it was 120.

944
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
It feels like it is.

945
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
But it's not.

946
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:47,000
That's why I made it 85.

947
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Advanced trackpad.

948
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Yeah it's an interesting idea.

949
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
But I just don't...

950
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
When I play a game right.

951
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
If I have a controller or if I'm using keyboard mouse.

952
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I don't really necessarily care or need an in between.

953
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I don't mind using a controller.

954
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I don't mind using a keyboard mouse.

955
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I don't know.

956
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I feel like it's kind of an in between with the steam controller.

957
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I'm sure it's cool.

958
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I just don't have the necessary reason to use it.

959
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I'm just splitting up here.

960
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Now the interesting thing about this game is there's these things called

961
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Grimores.

962
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
They give you bonus opportunity to get here with more dice.

963
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
That have higher chance to roll face up.

964
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
But if you pick up a grimoire, I know.

965
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I have to say it like that and I'm going to die.

966
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,000
It lowers your health by a pretty large margin and it's two in each level.

967
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:20,000
If you really want to try super duper hard, you pick up both grims.

968
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And you end up with like 30% HP.

969
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
And it is hard.

970
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Oh, oh, oh, wow, wow.

971
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Stay down.

972
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Grimore, remore, remore, remore.

973
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Grimore.

974
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I'm in the game.

975
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I was not going to say something that I hear it is.

976
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I thought the dwarf was in the session.

977
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I feel like I'm missing somebody.

978
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
One thing I wish you could turn on in this game.

979
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Atalus mentioned this as well when we were playing before.

980
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I wish I could turn on faint kind of permanent outlines because sometimes it is hard to do.

981
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I'm like, where is the dwarf?

982
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
A lot of times I just turn around and think the dwarf is a rat.

983
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Because he's like the same size and has the same body shape.

984
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Oh, yeah.

985
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
That's what I'm talking about.

986
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Oh, do you feel it?

987
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
You can turn on permanent outlines.

988
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Ken, where is it?

989
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I didn't see it in the options menu.

990
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
There isn't always outline button.

991
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Hold on a second.

992
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
And come from me.

993
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I want to investigate this.

994
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
No sensitivity weapon switch.

995
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Dodge jump, dodge on diagonal, double tap dodge, disabled, and then the next up.

996
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Endgame tutorial.

997
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Player outline is on.

998
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
It's on.

999
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1000
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Oh, oh, oh.

1001
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Did you look at that?

1002
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I thought it was either on or off.

1003
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I didn't know there was another one.

1004
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I don't know, but that's a little, that's a little too much though.

1005
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Let me try it for a little bit.

1006
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I wish it could, okay, is somebody else correct me?

1007
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Can I make that even fainter?

1008
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Or probably not?

1009
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
That is much, much better.

1010
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
But I wish it was a little lighter.

1011
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I mean, I saw, I looked at it, it said on.

1012
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And I was like, oh, on and I figured on or off.

1013
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I didn't know there was also like super on.

1014
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Yeah, we have on off or super on.

1015
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Whoa, you guys can't ignore it.

1016
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Yeah.

1017
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
We're in a bad position here.

1018
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
None of us have very much health.

1019
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
That's a tank.

1020
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And look at our health.

1021
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
This is not going to be good.

1022
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
This is not going to be good.

1023
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I'm going to have to go back to the other side.

1024
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I'm going to have to go back to the other side.

1025
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I'm going to have to go back to the other side.

1026
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Wow.

1027
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
You guys just come in and know where.

1028
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Fuck off.

1029
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
You've lost that.

1030
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Oh, there's no spark.

1031
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Yeah, this game is not going to be good.

1032
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Yeah, this game is not, this game is not easy.

1033
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Hard is actually hard.

1034
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
And then there are two other difficulties harder than this.

1035
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
There is nightmare and cataclysm.

1036
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I don't even want to know what this game is like on cataclysm.

1037
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:29,000
And if you do the glimmer, I don't even know how difficult that game is going to be.

1038
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
There we go.

1039
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I missed that really.

1040
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
How is that possible?

1041
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I'm not an imbecile.

1042
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I've learned when to speak.

1043
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I'm sure we're going to get wrapped around.

1044
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
How are we doing?

1045
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Assassin.

1046
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Very nice.

1047
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
That was a good shot with the shotgun from up here.

1048
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
You get a plus one.

1049
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
We get a plus one super skill.

1050
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Holy chargers.

1051
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Holy chargers.

1052
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Holy chargers.

1053
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Holy chargers.

1054
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Holy chargers.

1055
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Let's get some barrels.

1056
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Are we just going to go as a team or are we going to wait and get all a couple of them?

1057
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:04,000
What are we doing?

1058
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Is it okay if I drop some pickup lines in here so I can get it?

1059
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:19,000
You can do it every one, man.

1060
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Get out of here.

1061
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I thought sometimes they just run around looking at you and like, who do I hit?

1062
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Where's the last one going over there somewhere?

1063
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Let's carry it.

1064
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Whatcha out?

1065
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Stop procrastinating.

1066
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Close the stream.

1067
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Hold on.

1068
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:25,000
They can't shoot the barrels.

1069
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I'm going to get the fuck out of here.

1070
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:46,000
And three.

1071
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:53,000
You could have done last year.

1072
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:00,000
He waited a year.

1073
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I'm going to get a lot of people fighting him.

1074
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I love the big swing.

1075
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:37,000
It's great.

1076
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I love the big swing.

1077
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:51,000
It feels so fun to hit people with it.

1078
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Warhammer is a universe and they license it out for different developers to make different games.

1079
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Every Warhammer game that you play is not made by the same company.

1080
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Some of my favorite RTS games ever were the 40k series Warhammer 40k.

1081
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:25,000
The 40k series Warhammer was probably one of my favorite RTS games.

1082
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:33,000
That's a lot of stuff.

1083
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I'm just playing as the Tao.

1084
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Somebody else just picked that up, man.

1085
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:50,000
This is a lot of sanity.

1086
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Wow, he's cleared that out.

1087
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Nobody going to take that?

1088
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Fine, I'll heal.

1089
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I'll heal and I'll take it.

1090
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Game of the year was a blood one.

1091
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Blood going Victor Brand.

1092
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Probably body rising.

1093
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I didn't really play a whole lot of the top big games in 2000.

1094
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
A tomb.

1095
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
A tomb.

1096
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I'm going to grab the tomb.

1097
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
We have two tombs.

1098
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Somebody do that.

1099
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Somebody eat that.

1100
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Follow 4? I don't think follow 4 was a game of the year.

1101
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I wouldn't put follow 4 and then top 5.

1102
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I can't believe I put a fucking entire Egyptian tomb in that book.

1103
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I like saying tomb.

1104
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
No, it's a tomb.

1105
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
The tomb of unknown secrets.

1106
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Need ammo.

1107
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I don't think follow 4 was a bad game, but I don't think it was necessarily a great game.

1108
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I don't think follow 4 was game of the year good.

1109
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I just don't.

1110
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
It wasn't a bad game.

1111
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
It just means it wasn't the best game I've ever played.

1112
01:20:50,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I am not even close.

1113
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I want to go inside.

1114
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
This is a bad idea.

1115
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
This didn't do anything for me.

1116
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
All this did was just get me stuck.

1117
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
This is not the right way.

1118
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
The half man of the woods.

1119
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Are we not going up here?

1120
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Apparently not.

1121
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I haven't put enough time into Undertale.

1122
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I have played Undertale for a couple hours.

1123
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:58,000
But I haven't put enough time into Undertale to say it was the best game of the year.

1124
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I just haven't been able to determine that because I haven't played it for more than a couple hours.

1125
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I don't know what to do here.

1126
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I don't know what to do here.

1127
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I gotta leave.

1128
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
No, I gotta jump down.

1129
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I'm not going to jump down.

1130
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I'm not going to jump down.

1131
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Yeah, I gotta leave.

1132
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,000
No, I gotta jump down.

1133
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Too many gunners.

1134
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Can't go back up there.

1135
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Look at our max health.

1136
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:49,000
That is what happens when you pick up the two tombs.

1137
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:59,000
You have no health.

1138
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,000
There he is.

1139
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Oh, geez.

1140
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Anybody have any guns?

1141
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Any ammo?

1142
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
That's a terrible place for him to be.

1143
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:22,000
How the fuck are we going to get through that?

1144
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,000
No, rocked right into a pack guy.

1145
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:36,000
And I'm still miraculously.

1146
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I was just trying to block the attack so they could go.

1147
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Trying to jump.

1148
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Oh, we're in deep shit here.

1149
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Those two machine gunners being spawned right behind us there.

1150
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
It was the worst thing that could happen.

1151
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Good luck to this guy.

1152
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
That's game over.

1153
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,000
That is a game over.

1154
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Oh, well.

1155
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Hey, cool.

1156
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:20,000
You know, upgrade that item.

1157
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Dark Souls 3.

1158
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Looking forward to other things.

1159
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Yeah, Dark Souls 3 for sure.

1160
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Uh-oh, let's just try it again.

1161
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,000
We kind of got a bad deal there.

1162
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I've never got to the Rims of the Pubs.

1163
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
It's hard.

1164
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Oh, it's Alex wants to play.

1165
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I don't care.

1166
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Alex wants to play the video game called vermin time.

1167
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Alex, we'll get you in the next one.

1168
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Is that cool?

1169
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
not like more than 15 20 minutes ago

1170
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
By the way, a talents there. Look at do you see something do you notice something?

1171
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Do you notice the always on?

1172
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Outline it was actually in the options. We just we just didn't even see it

1173
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,000
There was another option to keep it always on rather than just on sometimes

1174
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
You know you guys all have to leave

1175
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Not kicking you guys out

1176
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
We need to free up one spot you guys are gonna have to do rock paper scissors

1177
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Rock paper rock paper for the time

1178
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Whoa, did he just was paired in my face?

1179
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
You guys all saw that that was odd

1180
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
What

1181
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Oh

1182
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Stop

1183
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Kind of been worse

1184
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Totem worse

1185
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Watch hey watch watch your six

1186
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Oh

1187
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Where the healing things

1188
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Is there only one or two

1189
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Some of you guys are quick this like this guy with the bow you are quick man. I thought I was gonna kill that guy

1190
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
You are a quick one

1191
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
You

1192
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Yeah, so somebody said I want this game, but I don't $25 want this game

1193
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
and

1194
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
yeah, I mean it's

1195
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
it is it is a

1196
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
it's good

1197
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
it's a full done

1198
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
complete 13 mission

1199
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
game with a bunch of items it is

1200
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I would say it's probably worth the $25

1201
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
because it's not

1202
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
necessarily a

1203
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I play that game I can complete that whole game in like

1204
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
an hour and ten minutes

1205
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I mean you want to experience all levels and play with the characters and get items

1206
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I think it's worth the $25 price tag

1207
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
but like you said is it worth it for you is that like is it worth the $25 for you

1208
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
which may am I not be the case

1209
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I

1210
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000

I

1553
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I'm scared of the tank. The tank will ruin everything. Like it did last time.

1554
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
You

1555
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
You

1556
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
You

1557
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
You

1558
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
You

1559
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
You

1560
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
You

1561
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
You

1562
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
You

1563
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
You

1564
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
You

1565
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
You

1566
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
You

1567
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
You

1568
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
You

1569
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
You

1570
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
You

1571
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
You

1572
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
You

1573
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
You

1574
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I

1575
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
I

1576
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
you

1577
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
You

1578
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
I

1579
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:05,000
I

1580
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I

1581
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
rotate

1582
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,000
I

1583
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I'm gonna show up like right here.

1584
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
This one.

1585
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
More side storm bombing.

1586
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Another century and we might think the marksman of you.

1587
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I did go to the 70 millimeter showing.

1588
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
And it was glorious.

1589
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
More potions over here.

1590
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I guess I need to die.

1591
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
One less poison.

1592
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
That's not.

1593
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I already have one.

1594
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Tartinos are weird guy.

1595
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
That's one way to describe it.

1596
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I think we're almost out of the woods here.

1597
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I'm gonna go this way.

1598
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I'm gonna go around.

1599
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I don't want to get stuck over here.

1600
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Shitload of people coming this way.

1601
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Where is he?

1602
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Really?

1603
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I thought I got you with that.

1604
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Get away.

1605
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Goodness.

1606
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Tartinos also loves closing car trunks.

1607
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
There's a lot of things that Tartinos likes to do.

1608
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
That's in almost every movie, right?

1609
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
I thought I'm bourbon.

1610
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Just make sure they're dead.

1611
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
You gotta hit them twice.

1612
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
It should be close to the end here.

1613
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,000
It looks like a person I know what.

1614
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
The rest of the way.

1615
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Scables, Slaver.

1616
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
A boom.

1617
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
We still have two toons.

1618
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Two toons?

1619
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
What's over there?

1620
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Actually, wait a minute.

1621
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
No, you need this.

1622
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Come here.

1623
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
I need that more than I do.

1624
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
You need that more than I do.

1625
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
One more toon, a defend event.

1626
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I just get so self-conscious.

1627
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Yeah, this is it.

1628
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
When we have this few health,

1629
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
it makes me so nervous.

1630
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Because there's no buffer.

1631
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
You take a couple hits like this and you're just done.

1632
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
You get too nervous like this.

1633
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
I don't like doing two of the rims.

1634
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
As much as it's awesome to get items,

1635
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
it just cares.

1636
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Especially on hard.

1637
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
It's okay.

1638
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
We'll be alright.

1639
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
We got it.

1640
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
We got to have more confidence, right?

1641
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Just get to full health.

1642
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Pick up the toon.

1643
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Another health over here.

1644
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Somebody gets a dire.

1645
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
They can go grab it.

1646
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
What about ammo?

1647
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
I could really use some gunner up top.

1648
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Okay, well, he's dead.

1649
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Anything else? Any ammo?

1650
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
What's the ammo?

1651
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,000
We only just stand somewhere to the seller.

1652
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Going in the seller? Is that the strategy?

1653
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I guess it is.

1654
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I guess we're going into the basement.

1655
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Look at this.

1656
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,000
What if a tank comes in here?

1657
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I remember I,

1658
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
but back in left for dead days,

1659
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
we used to do the bathroom strat.

1660
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Where all four people would stuff into one of the tiny bathrooms.

1661
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:19,000
And it worked for about a minute or two until a tank came.

1662
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
A tank would just come into the bathroom and everybody would die.

1663
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,000
But it was fun while the bathroom strat was fun while it lasted.

1664
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
They won't know we're in here.

1665
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Just keep giving them to be quiet.

1666
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
What is waiting for the boat?

1667
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I love shit like this.

1668
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
This is like my favorite thing about games like this.

1669
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I swear, we're in the sell- everyone shut up.

1670
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
They have to come through one door.

1671
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,000
They're just phasing through.

1672
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,000
What the fuck is happening?

1673
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Why?

1674
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:08,000
It was just getting stuck inside.

1675
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
No one's trying to open it.

1676
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
It's just open the door.

1677
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
You don't have to do this.

1678
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Uh-oh.

1679
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Easy.

1680
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,000
The one that was just stuck laying around.

1681
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,000
What the fuck was that?

1682
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
See?

1683
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:45,000
See these guys?

1684
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:53,000
I'm so confused.

1685
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Getting a lot of kills right now though.

1686
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Who's shooting the gun?

1687
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Why do I hear a machine gun?

1688
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:20,000
This is going.

1689
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
This works.

1690
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:30,000
It's all the green goo.

1691
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Let's go!

1692
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Anybody else?

1693
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Hey, we did it.

1694
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
I gotta get this guy.

1695
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I gotta get him.

1696
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Damn it.

1697
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:03,000
That was an interesting strategy.

1698
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:10,000
So we're going to have a lot of chances to roll.

1699
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,000
We get a legendary.

1700
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Oh, come on.

1701
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I'm going to do I need one, two, three, let's go.

1702
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Come on.

1703
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Shit.

1704
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Shit.

1705
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
That's a trinket though, right?

1706
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:36,000
What the fuck?

1707
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Engineers' tools.

1708
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
When throwing a grenade, there's a 15% chance

1709
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
that it won't be consumed.

1710
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Hold on a second.

1711
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I need to look at this.

1712
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Hey, happy new year to all of you central time zone people.

1713
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:03,000
There was a blue trinket right above it.

1714
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:08,000
So what does that do?

1715
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
I'm not a engineer's tools.

1716
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,000
So I can, okay, I can just equip it.

1717
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,000
So what is the trait?

1718
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
So I have to unlock that?

1719
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
No, I guess I don't.

1720
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
So that's just, let me wait a second.

1721
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
That's kinda cool.

1722
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Can I upgrade it?

1723
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Wouldn't any done.

1724
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Where is it?

1725
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Oh, I see.

1726
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Where is it?

1727
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
I guess you can't upgrade because it's already there.

1728
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,000
You can equip a trait.

1729
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Tools of the trade.

1730
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,000
That's quite, I guess that's kind of cool.

1731
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,000
That means that there's a more,

1732
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
most of the time when you throw a grenade,

1733
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
it's just randomly sometimes it's not gonna get consumed.

1734
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
But that means it doesn't really matter.

1735
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
That's my favorite Tarantino movie besides Pulp Viction

1736
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
because that one's too easy.

1737
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Oh, we talked about this the other day,

1738
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
like ranking Tarantino movies.

1739
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I don't know.

1740
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,000
It's hard to say.

1741
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:37,000
I was trying to think of like,

1742
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
kill bill, the first kill bill was pretty cool.

1743
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:46,000
The whole, all kill bill was interesting.

1744
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I need to look at like a list of like all the

1745
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Tarantino movies he's directed and produced.

1746
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Reservoir Dogs is an easy one to say too,

1747
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:09,000
but probably reservoir dogs who are kill bill.

1748
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Alright, it's Alex, you wanna play a video game maybe?

1749
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Yeah, you are.

1750
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
I liked the hateful A, man.

1751
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
I thought the hateful A was like one of his better movies.

1752
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I really do.

1753
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,000
I like the whole, I'm not gonna talk about plot points,

1754
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,000
but that whole movie just like how it's like,

1755
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
oh, you got these eight people and they're all different people

1756
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:53,000
and they're all fucking widows and they all have their own stories.

1757
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Who's the ones you can trust?

1758
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Who the good guys are?

1759
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Who the bad guys?

1760
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I like that dynamic.

1761
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:05,000
It's very interesting.

1762
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
I like Kurt Russell.

1763
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I like Samuel Jackson.

1764
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
That's just a good movie.

1765
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I recommend you see it.

1766
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Okay, it was, uh, not to me just very briefly do this.

1767
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Uh, Tauks, can you invite me to a game?

1768
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Well, we, uh, turn out dog cam.

1769
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:49,000
We're gonna do dog cam while Tauks invites me to a video game.

1770
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Okay, guys, you ready for the, he's like sleeping too.

1771
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
This is gonna be really cute.

1772
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:57,000
There you go. He's asleep.

1773
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,000
There he is sleeping.

1774
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Uh, invite me to a game, Tauks, if you can.

1775
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Well, we see auto the sleepy dog.

1776
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:18,000
My fan of clue, yes, that is a great movie.

1777
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Look at how he's just, it's stuff.

1778
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
He's like a little blanky dog.

1779
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Oh, hold on.

1780
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Uh, he's gonna hide now.

1781
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
The good men before I do so now.

1782
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:40,000
The metal table will show you our current situation.

1783
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
He's gonna hide.

1784
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
See, he does that in bed too.

1785
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Like, when he sleeps in my bed with me.

1786
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
And he just stuffs into the covers and just sleeps under the covers of me.

1787
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
He's a great dog.

1788
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I'm so glad he's okay.

1789
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
He's a good boy.

1790
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
My name is Atof.

1791
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Uh, Tauks, do you want to speak on the, on the internet telephone?

1792
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Would you want to do that for like a round or two?

1793
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
It's up to you.

1794
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:18,000
You write in the chat if you want to speak on the internet telephone for like an hour.

1795
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,000
I will, I will join the internet telephone if you want me to.

1796
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Okay, he's currently, he's currently in the internet telephone.

1797
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Uh, here we go.

1798
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Uh, I don't know if people can hear you or not.

1799
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Let's find out.

1800
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Yeah.

1801
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Hey, I'm happy new year, dude.

1802
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,000
It just, 1207.

1803
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
You're a time.

1804
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Yeah.

1805
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Uh, you should know people should be able to hear you.

1806
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Dude, happy new year.

1807
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Goody.

1808
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Happy new year.

1809
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Welcome to the new.

1810
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Oh, now, now I gotta get used to writing 2016.

1811
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
That's the new year joke.

1812
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Shut up.

1813
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Shut up with that.

1814
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,000
I gotta lower you a little bit, I think.

1815
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Where are you?

1816
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
At the hell are you?

1817
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Say some words.

1818
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Hey, everybody.

1819
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
What's going on?

1820
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
My name is German 95.

1821
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,000
We're with the team.

1822
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Gameplay commentary.

1823
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
He's gone.

1824
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Yeah, yeah, you're good.

1825
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
You're good.

1826
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Okay, let's, let's go back to, let's go back to reality here.

1827
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Um, what?

1828
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
What would you like to do?

1829
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Um, doesn't matter to me.

1830
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:45,000
I want to play, I want to play as the blue star.

1831
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
High star.

1832
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
That's funny.

1833
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Oh, I'm gonna be witch hunter.

1834
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Salt spire.

1835
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Check my walks with us.

1836
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,000
What a mission have you not done?

1837
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I've only done two or three, so like there's ten.

1838
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:10,000
I've not done smugglers run or black powder.

1839
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Uh, really?

1840
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
So take your pick.

1841
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I would do.

1842
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Either one of those is good.

1843
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Whatever one you feel like, don't.

1844
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Let's give black powder a try.

1845
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Do you want to go ahead and begin or do you want to wait?

1846
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Uh, those are the guys that were playing.

1847
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
If you guys queue up from black pub, the difficulty is easy.

1848
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Sorry.

1849
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
This one is just baby time.

1850
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Hold on a second to tell it's I got a toy for you.

1851
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Hey, usually I'm not the one that queues for this.

1852
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I gotta get used to it.

1853
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
What the crap is that?

1854
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
This is my fucking baby discell phone.

1855
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
You can take me Elmo.

1856
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Listen.

1857
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Oh, good night.

1858
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
There he is.

1859
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Is that better?

1860
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Yeah, we'll do normal.

1861
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
That's fine.

1862
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Do you want to do hard?

1863
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Do you want to do hard?

1864
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
It's up to you.

1865
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I don't know.

1866
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Is that like a you normally do hard?

1867
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
I'll do whatever you normally do hard.

1868
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Do hard.

1869
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Do hard.

1870
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Let's make it hard.

1871
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Okay.

1872
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
This guy is a charm.

1873
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Which one has these, uh, you can use these two guns.

1874
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I go bang, bang, bang, bang.

1875
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
He's very quick with his shooting.

1876
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
And he's got the pilgrim hat.

1877
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Yes, I think he's my favorite voice character.

1878
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
But it's like how he talks.

1879
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Let's go and take the kingdom.

1880
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:48,000
I actually kind of want to try the wizard again.

1881
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Wizard's fun.

1882
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
It's just hard.

1883
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
I don't know.

1884
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
It's hard to play.

1885
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,000
I want to try the new electric.

1886
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,000
There we go.

1887
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
We got心 of it.

1888
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
You want it?

1889
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Yeah.

1890
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,000
If you're currently playing the game and you'd like to play just

1891
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Q up for Black Powder Hard, I'm sure it's in the server browser as well.

1892
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:12,000
So it's the one with two or three people in it right now.

1893
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
I'm not sure.

1894
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
I'm not sure.

1895
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
I'm not sure.

1896
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
I'm not sure.

1897
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I'm not sure.

1898
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
I'm not sure.

1899
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,000
I'm not sure.

1900
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
I'm not sure.

1901
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I'm not sure.

1902
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I'm not sure.

1903
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
I'm not sure.

1904
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I'm not sure.

1905
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I'm not sure.

1906
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
I'm not sure.

1907
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I don't know.

1908
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I don't think you can.

1909
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
I think they just kind of do it whenever they feel like it.

1910
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Oh.

1911
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I thought maybe they would just like a diss way or.

1912
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
All right.

1913
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,000
We ready to go.

1914
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Kiss me.

1915
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,000
It's been like.

1916
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Is there a missile to?

1917
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Is there already passed the missile to time?

1918
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Missile to this is this is not Christmas man.

1919
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I was like when you swing the sword how you kind of stop in mid air and you.

1920
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Like.

1921
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Yeah.

1922
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Ready to go.

1923
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Yeah.

1924
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Yeah.

1925
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
This game.

1926
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Not this game.

1927
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
This sword has a lot of.

1928
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Stamina on it.

1929
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
A lot of stamina on it.

1930
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
What does that mean?

1931
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
A lot of stamina on it.

1932
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,000
What does that mean?

1933
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
A lot of stamina on it.

1934
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
What does that mean?

1935
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
A block.

1936
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,000
A block.

1937
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
A lot of attacks.

1938
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
A lot of.

1939
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Shield.

1940
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Yes.

1941
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Which one is this?

1942
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Reaper clone.

1943
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
What what mission is this?

1944
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Black powder I think.

1945
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,000
On hard mode.

1946
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Oh boy.

1947
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
This is my first time on hard mode.

1948
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Oh well.

1949
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Be gentle.

1950
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:41,000
You wouldn't you like to know.

1951
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
How's that guy already moving?

1952
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,000
You just like a scale.

1953
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I don't know.

1954
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I was like watching the cutscene.

1955
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Destiny wait.

1956
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Well, I don't want to do one thing real quick.

1957
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Hold on.

1958
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Let me see what happens here.

1959
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
If the stream goes down for a second, I apologize.

1960
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Proficially.

1961
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Well, let's see what happens.

1962
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the stream might just turn off.

1963
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I will turn it back on though.

1964
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
I promise.

1965
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
This is a job for the stewardors.

1966
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Why are they never out of work?

1967
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,000
When you need to.

1968
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I'm going to do it.

1969
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
I'm going to do it.

1970
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000
I'm going to do it.

1971
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I'm going to do it.

1972
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
I'm going to do it.

1973
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
I'm going to do it.

1974
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
I'm going to do it.

1975
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I'm going to do it.

1976
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I'm going to do it.

1977
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
I'm going to do it.

1978
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I'm going to do it.

1979
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I'm going to do it.

1980
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Do you do it?

1981
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
I'm going to do it.

1982
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,000
I'm going to do it.

1983
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Did it work.

1984
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Did it work.

1985
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Did it work?

1986
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Did you just.

1987
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Are we still alive.

1988
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Cause I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I try to put it up to 40 frames a second.

1989
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
40?!

1990
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Yeah.

1991
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
What is that going to look like on stream?

1992
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I've never seen that before.

1993
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Did the frame rate increase?

1994
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I'm not streaming this at 60?

1995
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Oh.

1996
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Die!

1997
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,000
I wonder if that did anything. I mean, I probably, I could try.

1998
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
But I, for some reason I was on 30. I don't know why.

1999
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I might have been the last thing I was recording.

2000
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Noisy. Just like a dwarf.

2001
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Hmm. I don't know.

2002
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
I actually want to know what that looks like.

2003
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Wow, 10 more. I've never seen a 40 frame per second stream.

2004
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
This is the first one ever.

2005
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,000
I just didn't know if you could do it like on the fly.

2006
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I need to restart the stream to do the FPS change.

2007
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
No, maybe I'll restart the stream.

2008
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Oh, whatever we care is.

2009
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,000
So on this, is this like the whole mission right here?

2010
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Yes, this is the whole mission.

2011
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:37,000
So, do you have any experience with using the bolt staff?

2012
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Zero.

2013
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Because the default basic attack seems like kind of weak.

2014
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,000
What about the charge up?

2015
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Pretty low charge up.

2016
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,000
It's been on 30. This whole, I didn't know it was on 30.

2017
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I usually stream it 40 or 45.

2018
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Has it been bad looking?

2019
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Or has it been just somewhat just normal looking?

2020
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Were you watching early?

2021
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
I was not watching on source.

2022
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:09,000
So, I can't really answer that question very well.

2023
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,000
I've been trying to expect stream when I stream at least 40.

2024
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Wow, why was it a 30?

2025
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,000
I wonder what the hell that was.

2026
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Oh, Jesus.

2027
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Whoa, people behind me.

2028
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
You do take fall damage in this game?

2029
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Yes.

2030
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:44,000
We need to pick up some barrels.

2031
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,000
I don't want to leave this guy alone.

2032
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
There's got tackled, but it's okay.

2033
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I got someone covering me.

2034
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
There's three guards up here, though.

2035
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,000
So, that's not good.

2036
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
I need to try to get to it at time.

2037
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
There's one up top all the way up top.

2038
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Are you going for the one all the way up top?

2039
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Ow.

2040
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Yeah, but I'm getting a little low.

2041
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,000
I got the one up top.

2042
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Rage and man, yeah, I'm getting, uh, getting pushed around a little bit.

2043
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I mean, slowly.

2044
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Is this the first one?

2045
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Is this number one?

2046
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Oh, wow.

2047
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
That almost is bad.

2048
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Holy crap.

2049
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,000
And a tank.

2050
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
We have one barrel.

2051
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,000
It's coming after me.

2052
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I can heal you in a second here.

2053
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:45,000
And once we kill this guy.

2054
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:48,000
I'm guessing jumping in the water is not good.

2055
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
No, it's not good.

2056
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Is that all right, come over here.

2057
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Are you the right way?

2058
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Yes.

2059
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Well, I didn't go off because I got it.

2060
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Hey, there we go.

2061
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Thank you.

2062
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Trying not to suck.

2063
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Again or nothing.

2064
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
That's about right!

2065
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Good.

2066
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Yeah.

2067
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Even the Sound cues are kind of like Lethkaverted.

2068
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Yeah.

2069
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:33,000
That's actually one of the things I like about it because it feels sort of familiar.

2070
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
But still unique.

2071
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,000
It's very very familiar, but it's still fun.

2072
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:44,000
How many do we have to with a 33 lower 4?

2073
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
3 to 8.

2074
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,000
You know why?

2075
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:53,000
I'm trying to get over the

2076
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000

2077
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:00,000

2132
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:11,000
end basically thanks for saving my life guys oh that's a gun that's a legendary come on all face up

2133
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:18,000
shit come on one more and I would have got a blue

2134
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:27,000
it's a staff hard mode was the right call it I was too it was too tough for a poor old me but

2135
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:33,000
still good hey I gotta is it a trinket is my first trinket

2136
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:40,000
is that a good thing yeah they have random effects so it can be like oh you're just a 20%

2137
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:49,000
I got you two percent move speed oh let's go back to the end two percent move speed

2138
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:56,000
yeah that doesn't sound like much maybe uh I can I can just outrun you guys now so they'll

2139
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:01,000
attack you first was that a green or is it a blue green I'm assuming there's probably a blue

2140
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:05,000
version that's 5% maybe I don't know yeah that that would be pretty nice 5% would actually be

2141
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:11,000
noticeable 2% is just you don't know if it's lag or if you're actually moving faster uh there's

2142
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:15,000
no campaign mode I mean no worst yeah but what we're doing there's no versus mode there's only

2143
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:27,000
campaign I feel like they were probably convinced they couldn't do a perfect balanced versus mode so

2144
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:32,000
if you can't like get it balanced and it's better just not to include it yeah that's probably true

2145
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:34,000
that's true

2146
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:44,000
I can probably craft down some shit

2147
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:59,000
actually I kind of want to play look at how many people that hits just with a default normal swing

2148
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:06,000
that's kind of insane it does like no damage but that is pretty damn cool you can just

2149
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:14,000
clear people out with it craft it all right I'm gonna try this staff instead I think it's gonna go

2150
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:21,000
better I don't even like I don't even keep fucking craft it don't I care

2151
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:29,000
yeah god the only one I haven't done is smuggler's run have you done that one recently

2152
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000

2153
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
oh good one one other you would rather play

2154
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:46,000

2195
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:45,000
had two bombs it's a healing drop here yeah good we get to we've two bombs ago yeah but they were

2196
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:48,000
they were put to good use maybe maybe

2197
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:58,000
we get this guy right in his face now he got his friend in the face

2198
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
there we go

2199
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:14,000
looking spawn the stab stab

2200
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:20,000
there's a lot of potions over here he's like a new sword rink and one

2201
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I'm gonna get like shit faced on these potions yeah what's that one I don't know

2202
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:29,000
just like blueberries which is fun oh yeah all right let's go

2203
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,000
open the floodgate

2204
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:46,000
this thing on my screen says left to harm our enemy why is it there is it like I told you

2205
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
that's just the on the middle of my screen forever

2206
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
so

2207
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
waiting for this giant door to come down

2208
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:19,000
when they start crawling down the walls and stuff they really do remind me of like

2209
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,000
the Lord of the Rings or the orcs crawling around everywhere

2210
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
the rats

2211
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I think everyone's like waiting on you to say that

2212
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,000
so by conflagration like we just like people on fire for the most part I guess

2213
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:54,000
seems pretty awesome the fireball one like pretty much instant destroys him this one's more like a

2214
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
dodge

2215
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
what's what does it call it?

2216
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
conflagration staff I think

2217
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
flagaration

2218
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
see it's how it can say where it's wrong too

2219
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
what is it? it's in a conflagration

2220
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:15,000
maybe I don't think I ever said that word out loud

2221
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:17,000
oh now

2222
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
apparently it's almost dead

2223
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:26,000
I seem to get a lot of bullets that I just didn't need to use but all right whatever

2224
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:36,000
oh a chest what's that? nothing absolutely nothing inside

2225
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I hate when that happens yeah it's annoying I don't think it's just like not have a chest

2226
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
we have less

2227
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:59,000
I just I like like just moving around we get fast to swinging this around like crazy it's

2228
02:21:59,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Devon it's great

2229
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:05,000
and you can shoot the sidearm medical supplies

2230
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:11,000
is that I like it I found my new favorite item oh really?

2231
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,000
yeah just something about it's fun to use

2232
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
oh

2233
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:28,000
the big opens this is a pretty big area lots of room for activities

2234
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
yeah we're gonna get some warm-tier

2235
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:40,000
all right is there a gattling gunner from here? because it just gave me a tool tip

2236
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
really hey watch out for the gattling gunner

2237
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
just to let you know in case you find one sometime

2238
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:51,000
it just gave me a random tip about the gun oh that was fun

2239
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:57,000
but just like head exploding oh I just sidearmed that guy and it's a friggin temple

2240
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,000
let's move out

2241
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:27,000
I can definitely tell a different between hard mode and normal mode let me say that

2242
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:31,000
yeah like I was saying earlier can you imagine doing this on like anything besides what we're doing right now

2243
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:38,000
like going another step up another step up just I'm gonna play that expert on left for dead

2260
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:26,000
hard but you know what you could always just be crawling around on your knees and sliding around

2261
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:30,000
and you could do that you could just like make sure you look at me a contact and find it

2262

yeah let's just let's just call it great corner creeps more

2264
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:44,000
I'm dead in one hit by the way uh yeah I'm dead in about two

2265
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:49,000
oh dees

2266
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:55,000

pretty good it's got it's got it's decapitated now you're down hang on hold it there you go

2271
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:26,000
full swing and hit me holy shit

2272
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
try him in the head he's moving around too much

2273
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:41,000
we live another day and we're all bleeding out of the same thing yeah we are

2274
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:49,000
so good luck one one hit from one rat is about to put me back down

2275
02:26:54,000 --> 02:27:00,000
like I'm about to bleed out just follow on these guys around just run run like guys like

2276
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,000
guys really far ahead

2277
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,000
anything anything oh just I just got the way for myself

2278
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:15,000
I just got the rest like I used my my spell and it took me above the threshold

2279
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:18,000
look at the minute there's too many there's too many we're never gonna win

2280
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:27,000
just keep moving

2281
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:34,000
just sit dead in no

2282
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:43,000
I'm about to bleed out yeah I got you I'm about to bleed out I'm bleeding

2283
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:49,000
I'm not gonna make it very much longer oh this wasn't that

2284
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:55,000
I'm just getting so turned around I think we have to actually go in here yeah I think we

2285
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:00,000
have to go into this pit where they're all spewing from probably

2286
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:12,000
oh dead apparently oh like no no I am done done like dead dead dead you

2287
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:16,000
can have to go find me I think it's anything with left or dead if you go down like three times

2288
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:19,000
in a certain amount of period yeah that makes sense

2289
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
well good luck

2290
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:33,000
yeah about that there's a gambling gun guy just chilling in here but we're hitting

2291
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:38,000
them with my legs they were two they were two gambling gunner guys in there yeah look at well

2292
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,000
give all credit to the teammates because oh geez I have nothing is there any any

2293
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:48,000
portions there anything no food in there I'll get up that ladder

2294
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:53,000
oh come on oh do you see where I am I'm in here

2295
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:01,000
the line down oh wait we won that's it we did it should we just get in yeah I just get in

2296
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:07,000
forget about me okay I died for a good time sorry germa we didn't want to leave you but we had to

2297
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:16,000
it's okay oh yeah oh that's good we get less experience you don't lose anything

2298
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:25,000
you got two extra die you get bonus points for going with everyone I guess yeah you get more experience

2299
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:34,000
all right time time to roll three four five there's a legendary at the top

2300
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:42,000
no what's your gunner be I need to roll it out too

2301
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:58,000
so I've actually the first time I think I've seen a mace it's for the empire I get I got a green axe

2302
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:01,000
for the dwarf

2303
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:13,000
this guy was fucking carrying hard yeah he was about to say the exact same thing

2304
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:22,000
really hard carrying he isn't the best good work guy that won us the game he's very humble too

2305
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:27,000
I want to look at that mace

2306
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
so

2307
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
who's before the empire soldier I don't think I can uh

2308
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:50,000
all could you walk this like around how many missions do you need to do before you start like

2309
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:56,000
crafting stuff once you get a handful of greens you can start to break them down and make things

2310
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:05,000
I mean the I'm the one hander it's cool but I got you do you have the crossbow for the witch

2311
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:13,000
hunter assuming yes no I mean I've been crafting down 90% of the things I get to try to make

2312
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:18,000
something for a character I like to play oh really well I mean don't you like the witch hunter

2313
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:25,000
I do like the witch hunter but I also like empire so I like witch hunter dwarf and empire soldier

2314
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:35,000
way watchers fun but I don't know I like playing big two-hander or big you know fast super dude

2315
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:42,000
but I suggest buying the complete edition instead of the normal what's in the complete edition

2316
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:49,000
are you sure that's not like a soundtrack I'm like being completely honest like I think

2317
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:56,000
that like digital art book I don't know I just bought the normal version I thought

2318
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:09,000
this is the I like these because now how does that make any sense right so this is a big two-handed

2319
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:15,000
mace and it hits way less targets with under this hit this hits so many people with a little one

2320
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:24,000
hander really I guess they kind of reverse right so the big two-hander the charge attack hits a

2321
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:31,000
million people but it's normal attack hits like one person but the one-hander hits way more

2322
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:35,000
people along the standard attack but doesn't hit barely anybody with a charge attack but does more

2323
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:39,000
damage and I'll give it a try I'm gonna try it

2324
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
we already have an empire soldier

2325
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
I think I'm gonna try two-handed dwarf

2326
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:11,000
okay that for now I'm scared to crack the charge attack most of the time that's what I was

2327
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:14,000
doing when I was playing with it mostly just sweeping side to side

2328
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
yeah you kind of do just bop people with the big two-hander

2329
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:28,000
oh again I can change to the empire soldier

2330
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:33,000
so here's the new mace

2331
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:45,000
it's got an odd animation set looks like it's left and right up down no down up

2332
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
what's the charge charge is just straight up and down

2333
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
all right other one more let's do one more

2334
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:01,000
oki doki um I have unlocked new missions let's do one of the ones you've unlocked

2335
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:13,000
we can do garden of more man the ramparts engines of war or wheat and shaft wheat uh that's

2336
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:17,000
one where you grab bags and bring them it's a short one do that one we'll do that one it's

2337
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:18,000
that one's short

2338
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:29,000
until in the last three oh how you sure

2339
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:39,000
oh yeah baby let's get our asses kicked for the little for let's get our asses kicked to end

2340
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:48,000
the stream that sounds like fun dick together please I do what I can mom

2341
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:54,000
die well yeah I like that's one of my favorite lines die well yeah

2342
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
die die well yeah

2343
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:07,000
all right let's make it a good one

2344
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:17,000
the sky then seem to have overlooked some of the farm but it won't last for long the end time

2345
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:25,000
so what are the odds of them making another game in this vein but for like 40k

2346
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:37,000
okay probably very close to zero but what are they like future plans was this game successful

2347
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I mean it's isn't this by the same sales why is this by the amount uh the war the Vikings guys

2348
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:46,000
didn't they make this game I feel like they just do different games every time they make

2349
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:52,000
a game I feel like people like hire them out to do games yeah I mean fat shark is made

2350
02:35:52,000 --> 02:36:02,000
devs for hire did they do mountain blade I know they did some ARPGs like one or two ARPGs

2351
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:07,000
they've done crater ready the crater was one of them I know they did

2352
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:12,000
some more of the Vikings are they published more the Vikings was that paradox I don't even know

2353
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:16,000
it's politics gaming politics your nose I think the paradox published for the Vikings

2354
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:24,000
well I guess my point is that they don't they haven't like they don't like stick with one

2355
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:27,000
particular series I don't think they kind of just make whatever games they feel like making anything

2356
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:37,000
although did it maybe did it more the roses um you know I feel like I should know the answer to

2357
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:42,000
these questions should know the answer your italics like the gamer knowledge guy I'm like the NDE person

2358
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:51,000
I should know answers can we couple horse uh I don't think so paradox published mountain blade

2359
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:02,000
yeah but mountain blade and war the roses are not the same thing no not maybe I'm confusing

2360
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:08,000
to mountain blade was published but not it was like it's a different thing like the new mountain

2361
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:17,000
blade is not paradox okay but the old one was technically published by them more the roses I don't

2362
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:22,000
know it doesn't matter are we going all I think we're going all the way it looks like we are

2363
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:28,000
I mean I think since to start with the far ones early on that would make sense with

2364
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:34,000
move back there's a lot of guys in here though that would make

2365
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:53,000
so can the sex also burn I don't like it if they get damaged I'm just I'm terrified to eat

2366
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:58,000
attempt to oh boy you are in deep shit by yourself down there not me oh that's right you're not

2367
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:01,000
playing that character I am the dwarf

2368
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:17,000
oh why am I taking damage oh I miss being able to swing big swing and hit everybody

2369
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:32,000
oh dear I can't even see where is he I got the poison he's effectively blocking my vision

2370
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:52,000
you son of a bitch stay with me do we have all the sacks is it one more we got him oh crap

2371
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:58,000

2372
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:06,000
you getting wrecked or some people somebody might come save you what happened was I went into a room

2373
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:11,000
to peak and I was just turned around that might be a mistake as soon as I turned around seven to ten

2374
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:19,000
rats just dropped in front of the door frame that I was in the tank and the tank's right

2375
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:28,000
he's serious yeah he's just hitting me but I'm trying to get close like I can to you guys

2376
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:42,000
we got to play as the soldier or the witch Empire soldier

2377
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:48,000
because I am saying it's both you as possible for when I bleed out again

2378
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:55,000
he's dead hey we're fine we're fine come here where are you where are you

2379

2380
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
wasn't a short joke that was a short fact

2381
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:13,000
so so where the sacks over here have we already deposited the other ones we'd

2382
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:23,000
there we'd positive two oh okay then I don't like this weapon I don't like it you decided

2383
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:30,000
that you don't like it I don't like it not a fan what is it again so one-headed base that

2384
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
barely don't like the breach

2392
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:29,000

what the hell is it like a third horde in a row this is that is like three in a row yeah we

2400
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:26,000
the wheel this is it we can get these then we can just get in with the truck we're so close to

2401
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:33,000

2405
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:11,000
good well they're really good teamwork we got a kind of hairy there for a second

2406
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:18,000
there was such good teamwork everybody was sticking together except for me when I went down

2407
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:22,000
and had to get rescued this is when we're gonna get the legendary legendary acts

2408
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:30,000
oh they're gonna be all based up how tough is it to get like the extras on this map like the dives and the

2409
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:38,000
thomes i'm not joking i just got all face down is he really and i only got one so

2410
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:48,000
bowlhead drink it is there only like one face per side well equipped your health is increased by

2411
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:56,000
30% well knocked it down that's that's pretty good so that means that you'll just stay alive longer

2412
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:06,000
when you're knocked down yeah I just said yeah I have no idea let's go

2413
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:17,000
all right well I think um times it's probably getting late and it's like 2 a.m.

2414

2416
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:39,000

2417
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:46,000
a pro man this guy is a pro he's probably like really complaining about us when we can't hear him

2418
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:52,000
I wonder I wonder if he's just like he thinks we just suck he's like oh my god he's

2419
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:56,000
yet he gets don't even know how to do like the real strategies fuck these two oh he did

2420
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:02,000
anyone 360 no scope that guy okay I wish can I like inspect him I want to see what he has he

2421
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:07,000
probably has cool stuff that would be cool what's that on his belt I want to see it all those

2422
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:13,000
onions all those onions dude he's got like garlic it's a it's a fucking anti vampire he's got like

2423
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:18,000
a bunch of cloves of garlic on him when I when I crouch I feel like a baby

2424
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
well I want to see his garlic belt look at that look at that garlic

2425
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:29,000
if she's got a two look she got go to nice what about you

2426
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
you don't have any garlic you suck

2427
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:39,000
all right well thanks uh what does this look like

2428
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:47,000
oh what does it look like when I when I crouch dodge like this

2429
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:56,000
you gotta just jump backwards I'm crouching though I should be really little uh you I don't

2430
02:45:56,000 --> 02:46:02,000
think you have a crouch you're crouching right now your crouch is you kind of just peering over

2431
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:07,000
and looking at a situation now I'm crouching now now now now now your crouch is just you

2432
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:13,000
punching your face forward a tiny bit I'm like taking this tactical position

2433
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:20,000
I gotta make sure that like I I stay as low as I can you're peering around a corner

2434
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:25,000
you're hiding from somebody and looking like oh can you see me what is what is the shrine of

2435
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:33,000
solace I just am I oh this is a case when you go to here yeah you when you salvage items

2436
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:38,000
whatever rarity they are yeah you get the little stones little stones and then you can take

2437
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:45,000
those stones and you can craft a random item for whatever melee slot character you want you put

2438
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:50,000
the trinket in here it looks like you can choose ranged or melee you can or you can save um

2439
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:54,000
you can save a little bit and pick a random so it'll be a ranged or melee

2440
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:00,000
but it's cheaper it is cheaper but you don't know what you're gonna get so if you specifically

2441
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:04,000
want to sword and you do the random and you get a bow or something you're gonna be like oh

2442
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:13,000
shit I should just wait it's pretty cool yeah I mean guys we're talking about thanks for

2443
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:17,000
joining me thanks for joining me in you know us to me in italics italics K by and his hung out

2444
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:27,000
for our entire year of 2016 entire entire year of 2016 scream I haven't turned off my stream

2445
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:37,000
the entire year this is 365 days of streaming full 100% have not turned off my stream all year

2446
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:47,000
everyone wants to talk about how I don't stream this is this is the longest stream of 2016

2447
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:54,000
I don't know about that no it no it is this is the longest currently running stream of 2016

2448
02:47:54,000 --> 02:48:00,000
no it's not it's tied for first so you know that because you physically couldn't have been streaming longer

2449
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:06,000
well what if some a bunch of other people that were streaming and were streaming at like at midnight exactly

2450
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:13,000
yeah well you're tied for first this is the longest you know yeah you're right you're right I am tied

2451
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:23,000
for first right now so therefore you're you're just like having a world record yeah I did say that

2452
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:27,000
but here let's let's let's break this before I end the stream let's break this down for just a second

2453
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:34,000

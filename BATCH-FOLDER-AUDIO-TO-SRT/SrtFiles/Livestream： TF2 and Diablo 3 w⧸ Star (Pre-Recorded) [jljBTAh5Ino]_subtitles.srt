1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, that's done on Twitter.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Oh, God, people are dying. They need my help.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I got you. Don't worry. I got you.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There's a spy up there, but I can't do anything about it.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But I can kill this sniper.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Nevermind.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
All right. I got to write this on steam.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I need to go on steam.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Community. I decided first.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Groups.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh, I grew up of 5,000 members.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Wow. Awesome, guys. Thanks.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
5,000 steam group members. That's unbelievable.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Party.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And it's happening. Let's say in 15 minutes.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Sounds good.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And I think it's gonna pop up.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, we got hit.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
All right. Now I can stop playing. I'm in my server right now, guys, if you're wondering.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's 8 o'clock at night. Are you in Australia or something? Must be pretty across the world.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm in my server right now.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have to play soldier.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh. I think we're gonna have a special guest.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, we're gonna have, I think we might have a special guest in a second here, dudes.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, I gotta do something real quick.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Real quick and a quick.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let me get back to this page.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So one more test for the new guys that just showed up.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Boy, was this in your sub box?

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I feel like it's not.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If it is, I'm totally wrong if it isn't.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And I screwed something up.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But I think we might have a special guest referee.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hold on, just a minute, guys.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hold on, just a minute.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Thanks for the 8, Doc.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Bring this over here.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And special guest.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Are we gonna have a special guest?

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, special guest is.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll let him introduce himself when he gets in here.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What's up, man?

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hold on, hold on.

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No one can hear anything you're saying because I have to change this.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I built you up, too.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I was like, oh, here he is, the special guest.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And then nobody can hear you.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now they can.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hello.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's star, ladies and gentlemen.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, my God, is it the real one?

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I think it might be the fake one.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He usually is.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I literally just woke up.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Got out of bed.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He's streaming.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah, yeah, I just decided to do it.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I didn't do it last night, so I tell him what's up.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I have to do it every week.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That is a good goal.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's on your YouTube channel?

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, I don't see it.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Maybe I'm just dumb.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It should be in feeds.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, yeah, they like tuck it away there.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah, it's not like in subscription boxes and the feed.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm like student people on my own team, like doing.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Can you get in here?

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will do that.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I just...

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Is it possible?

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, one second.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I was just like removing HUD elements and I'll fix that up.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And come in.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Somebody said, star, I just want to let you know.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You are the shit, brosif.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh, shit.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I did not know that about myself.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, you are.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Nice, nice, uh, Pyro.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Good job.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Good job, Pyro.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
PyRizzle?

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, my God, run.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There's nothing I could do there.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And now the plan is to jump.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh, the rocket.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're going to use the rocket and immediately get back stabbed again.

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The control point is being corrected.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Mm.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Surfer is full.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Who the thunk?

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Who the thunk?

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, my reserve slot.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm going to have somebody in the sir.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh, God, this might be bad.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I might have to kick a couple people.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm going to ask if anyone's, because I'm not going to kick anyone to the list of willing.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Uh.

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:01,000
See if I can get maybe one or two people.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Because I need two slots.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm bad fat.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Boom.

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Boom.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
All right.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's see.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Are you, uh, are you like auto joining?

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Spamming joint game.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
All right.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm going to get that set up.

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
My, uh.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There's a lot of things you need to get set up.

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I know there is.

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There is a lot of stuff I need to get set up.

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Like removing gold rush.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But what?

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Really?

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You don't like gold rush?

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's alright sometimes.

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't know.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It seems like it's come up a lot.

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Every time I look at your answer, it's like, hey, let's play gold rush.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, I love gold rush.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Gold rush is like my favorite map.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay, I didn't say anything.

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No, I, I, I got a lot of things that have to happen with this server.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
All right.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He's still, is it still full?

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm ready.

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Is it ready?

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm about to do something right now.

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's a drastic time.

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Scope of drastic measures.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Are you leaving your server?

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
No.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm going to restart it.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't know if that's the fairest way to do it.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I guess this is the, this is the really only way, the fair way.

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No one's leaving.

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, you're all getting out.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's closed.

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Uh-uh.

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is my server, but we're trying to get star in the game.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And my reserve slot isn't really set up correctly, so it doesn't work.

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So I need to restart the server.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Just to make it so everyone can, you know, get in if they need to.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Server is going to restart right now after I do this.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Let me do this.

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm all getting to here.

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's all right.

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
How's your morning doing?

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You see, you just woke up.

157
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yep.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Say that a bed.

159
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's the best kind of, that's the best kind of out of bed.

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, just.

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Uh-uh.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, at least I went to the bathroom first.

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It wasn't like, hey, computer.

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, at least you did you, uh, did you do number one, number two, number three, or all of them?

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Number one, it smelled like pork.

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What?

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Extra info.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You could have said all the above.

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, no, I had to give the extra info.

170
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Like, brag that I ate a whole bunch of pulled pork yesterday and it's probably the greatest food ever made.

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I love pulled pork.

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Pull pork is incredible.

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
All right, so here we go.

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Server is going to restart.

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So, dots, bam!

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Err!

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's like I'm playing Diablo 3.

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's like a Harley B if neither of us is that on.

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Look at this.

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The stream is like, look at, look at how stupid this is right now.

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's like, can we get into my own server?

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh my god, I think I got into my own server.

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yes.

184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, or a harvest event.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Did you get in?

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes.

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It is a good day to be harvest event.

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It is a good day.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, that's one way to do it.

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So now we can start the stream.

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So thank you for your patience, dudes.

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I appreciate it.

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It only took like 75 hours to start the stream.

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Only all the hours.

195
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
All the things.

196
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You're joking.

197
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
All right.

198
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I have to restart TF2.

199
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, do you really?

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh, we cursed it.

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, I do.

202
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because you boarded something bright.

203
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
My graphics card immediately crashed.

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
All right.

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Well, you will get in here if you restart as quick as you can.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Do a quick speedrun.

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Join TF2.

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
There still looks like 7 on 7 right now.

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And if not, then I'm going to have to kick somebody.

210
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Someone who's playing spy.

211
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's how you'll choose.

212
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's full.

213
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, no, no, I got it.

214
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, yes.

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yes.

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Where'd he go?

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I need to get like a custom hard, like a real custom hard.

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Because right now this thing is like blocking my view.

219
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This capture holds the control points to win the game.

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's like, I didn't know that.

221
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I told you again.

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, I just, I thought that was a trade.

223
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Sorry.

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You were trying to do it again.

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I thought that was a trade.

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, run.

228
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No, no.

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That control point was being captured.

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I was just assuming the item server was perpetually down.

231
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah, it should be up.

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I got my items.

233
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah, I do.

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So hello, everybody.

235
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Welcome to this early Sunday stream.

236
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We've got special guest star here.

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I am going to bottom-frag every time.

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I probably will too.

239
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
All I want to is jump.

240
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Like jump it all I can do.

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Jump this way, that way.

242
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh, God.

243
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Why is it doing this?

244
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay, it didn't crash.

245
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It didn't crash.

246
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's all good.

247
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Good.

248
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Good, good, good, good.

249
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
All right, I'm getting shot at from somewhere.

250
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Oh, I'm too crazy.

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He punched me.

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He actually punched me.

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
See, I changed my setup a little bit.

254
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
See, I'm playing obviously in a window.

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And I moved the window to the right part of my screen.

256
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So I'm just like, look, I got to get used to this.

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Because I have the chat on the left and I have the window.

258
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I know, I need two monitors.

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So bad.

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I can't believe I waited as long as I did the end.

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Just for streaming.

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's enough reason.

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I just need a...

264
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I need a better computer.

265
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's the problem is my computer is just...

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's good.

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's good computer, but it's just not good enough

268
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
to do two things at the same time.

269
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm gonna go scout.

270
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We'll go scout.

271
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What's somebody's asking the IP?

272
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's just in my server.

273
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
When I got smashed right there, that's not good.

274
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's in many centuries.

275
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I shouldn't even mention it.

276
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But nothing?

277
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What am I complaining about?

278
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Nobody heard it.

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No one heard it.

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, get him.

281
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I can't believe I got up and he got away.

282
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Also another problem.

283
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Harvest event is really dark.

284
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So it's a guard to see anyways.

285
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This map is...

286
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I should play it more often.

287
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Because I play way too much harvest, but this is like...

288
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's totally different.

289
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, it's like a whole new world.

290
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Playing crit scout.

291
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah.

292
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I can't even go over there.

293
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You'll be in the rocket jumps.

294
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Rocket job.

295
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh, no, I ran into the damn ghost.

296
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I hate this ghost.

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Why is this mapping my rotation?

298
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't know why.

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I missed.

300
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Actually, it's good every now and then.

301
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah.

302
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Kind of like...

303
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I really hate Iaduct for the fact that it has pumpkins laying everywhere.

304
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You kill by a pumpkin, you feel like an idiot.

305
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But Iaduct looks amazing.

306
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Compared to the other buy-aducts.

307
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah, Iaduct is fun.

308
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I just got killed by a pumpkin.

309
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Crit scout.

310
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Crit scout.

311
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, come on.

312
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He wasn't even there before.

313
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's Malaki.

314
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Malaki.

315
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Malaki.

316
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Malaki.

317
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm going to the straight.

318
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Somebody's behind me, but I want to kill the soldiers.

319
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Anyways.

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
No, this guy's got me.

321
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This guy's got me.

322
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, this guy's got me.

323
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, no, I got him.

324
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm not going in there.

325
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Pumpkin.

326
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I shouldn't have shot him from that far away.

327
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Too bad.

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Too bad.

329
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Too bad.

330
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Actually, I'm not doing too bad right now.

331
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Well, I'm doing terrible because I haven't marked a garden to anyone yet.

332
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Okay, it's off of that montage, remember.

333
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Totally.

334
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I got the most amazing one yesterday.

335
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Quite literally the most amazing marking gardener has probably ever happened.

336
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Ever.

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What'd you do?

338
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's...

339
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't know.

340
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't know.

341
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I haven't described it, but it was four rocket jumps.

342
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I was surfing up a ramp.

343
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So I was technically on the ground except for the ramp.

344
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So I was technically on the ground except it doesn't count you as on the ground.

345
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You know, is it the same type of thing when you...

346
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You know when you air blast somebody that's on an incline and they don't go anywhere,

347
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
but technically they're still in the air.

348
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah, it's like if anything is slanted and you rocket jump past enough,

349
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
you'll slide up it and sort of launches you off.

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It was the middle of sliding up something and I hit somebody.

351
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, when I use the reserve shooter,

352
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'll air blast somebody that's on an incline.

353
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
They don't go anywhere, but they still get the mini-crets on them.

354
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's weird.

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Is the server full?

356
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I believe it is.

357
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I believe it is.

358
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I have to imagine so.

359
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This is your first stream ever.

360
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And welcome.

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Thanks for coming, man.

362
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh, okay, Oss.

363
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Absolute, okay, Oss.

364
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I need health. I'm not going after that.

365
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Demo, man, with that health.

366
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What a bad idea. Why am I drinking this right here?

367
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That was a terrible idea.

368
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Pump good.

369
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah, grip.

370
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
How?

371
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That is star.

372
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Your ears are not deceiving you.

373
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I think I just racked jumped off a pumpkin and it was...

374
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It was glorious.

375
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Is that like possible?

376
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Can you actually do it?

377
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Either that or a rocket hit me as I jumped.

378
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I don't know.

379
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Wow.

380
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, I was pulling out.

381
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That was just one of those moments when my whole body just shaked.

382
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Shaked.

383
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Shaked.

384
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Because I like this pulling out my melee and he shot me.

385
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Nearly 11 p.m.

386
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Ooniq bandit. Where are you from, man?

387
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's a long...

388
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's a huge difference.

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, pumpkin.

390
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yes, this is being recorded and will be uploaded in a few hours whenever I finish.

391
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
14 days, you gotta wait for it.

392
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's two weeks for processing.

393
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Actually, you know, the 720 streams on YouTube, they do take quite a long time process.

394
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Really?

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Melbourne, Australia.

396
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That is across the whole world.

397
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Well, thanks for coming to.

398
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's a long ways away.

399
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Go in.

400
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Immaculate crits.

401
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Haha.

402
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah.

403
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I can't go over there.

404
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's certain death. Get out of here.

405
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh, it's a ghost.

406
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Now I am so dead.

407
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Nice shot, dude.

408
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Nice shot.

409
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Do I have any scout tips?

410
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Start. Do you have any scout tips?

411
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Shoot things, I guess.

412
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Shoot things and run.

413
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah.

414
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I will tell you, those scout from me at least used to be one of my worst classes.

415
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I was awful.

416
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I was just playing.

417
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's just the more you play with it, the better you're going to get.

418
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I know.

419
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I had like a die a lot.

420
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I had pretty much, it was my least play class behind Pyro.

421
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Now it's one of my most play classes.

422
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, God.

423
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Do you need to die a lot to start realizing you're going to die a lot of scout?

424
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
No, I think we got a robot star here.

425
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry.

426
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
No, not anymore.

427
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I am getting random blanks, so maybe everyone's in a while.

428
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'll be a robot.

429
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's okay.

430
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We forgive you.

431
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
We all still love you.

432
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I think that's spy.

433
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
No, yeah, it is.

434
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh, yeah, it is.

435
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm just not getting the yellow bat.

436
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
There's no elevator on this map.

437
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You was here last night, too, wasn't you?

438
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Come on.

439
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What's that from stuff?

440
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't know.

441
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Oh, come on.

442
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm not cool.

443
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh, home alone, too.

444
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm the one that's not cool, and you're quoting home alone.

445
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Never mind.

446
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm not cool.

447
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm not cool.

448
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm not cool.

449
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I love that movie.

450
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Bapboop shot.

451
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Bapboop.

452
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh, so I went to Duncan Donuts.

453
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Don't do it.

454
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh, you can do it.

455
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Oh, it's so good.

456
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You got Duncan Donuts in New Jersey.

457
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah, actually a one train ride home from Boston.

458
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
There's Duncan Donuts.

459
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
There's like three Duncan Donuts in South Station.

460
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So I bought a dozen chocolate frosted donuts for myself.

461
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The person getting them for me just the entire time they're picking out donuts, giving me this awkward look.

462
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What could you possibly be using these for?

463
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
That's a lot for one person.

464
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I had them.

465
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I need two slots.

466
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You need two reserved slots.

467
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Please reply what server is it?

468
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's my server.

469
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
My server.

470
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
German East Coast server.

471
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And I'll put it down.

472
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I hate when that happens.

473
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Thank God we found a way to make a spiritually healthy Lewis.

474
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I changed the Holy Power in the last two months.

475
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Their higher standards werecost.

476
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And I will read the comments down in the comments

477
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and they're doing it on phone.

478
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I had looked through time.

479
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Without the 800K subscribers,

480
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I probably would have watched a lot of videos that I didn't watch ever before.

481
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Where is he I heard a spy

482
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Not was a dumb thing

483
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Someone said donuts are amazing especially crispy crispy creams. You've had a crispy cream donut

484
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I think so no maybe oh, yeah so good

485
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Crispy cream donuts are incredible. I don't know don't have names

486
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Well, it's like it's like a company. It's like kind of like a Dunkin Donuts

487
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Except it's crispy creams

488
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Pretty much a crispy cream donut is just a glaze donut and it literally melts inside of you mouth. It is just on

489
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's unreal. You can't there's only like a few of them around the Northeast though. Unfortunately

490
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You've ever had ice cream

491
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Ice cream what what's ice cream is that like something to do with like milk?

492
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What am I doing why am I doing this?

493
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Am I ever gonna put a ping limit on my server to be honest

494
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Probably money

495
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Probably not the only reason why I say that is because I haven't had one in the last like

496
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Two or three weeks since the server's been online and hasn't really been any problems

497
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So probably not and if there ever was money would probably be something very very high something like

498
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Ridiculously high like 480 or something

499
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That's pretty low. That's

500
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I wish I had 480 thing

501
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Oh this heavy oh my god I ran out of books. Oh no

502
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Oh, what I did. Oh, what I do that

503
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Mr. Foreman Gary the foreman Gary

504
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay, I think this is guy's name

505
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Okay, he he told me I

506
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
To say his name

507
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And I just did it because I felt like

508
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Don't worry about this thing built up baby. Let's do it baby

509
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
There was a ghost

510
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'll name him Gary. Oh, what I didn't get it off in time. Oh, I'm so mad at myself

511
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Let's go for a punch ready

512
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
We're going punch only engineer right now. It's gonna work because every time I scream I'm telling you to do it every time I stream

513
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And I just go for melee only it for some reason it works. I don't know why I don't know

514
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I wish I did the answer

515
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But for instance like oh my god this guy just screams me no, I have no

516
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Oh

517
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That was a nice attempt with the NG Fest only critSkrieg

518
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It's super effective that's her Pokemon I

519
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Tate this door glitch on our list. I want to leave a stuck somewhere

520
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm on the out

521
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Punch in the center I'm gonna punch

522
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
All right, so I'm gonna ask you this first before I

523
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Before I answered but do you like the Vikings?

524
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Vikings, huh

525
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Like like real Vikings are we talking about fictional Vikings right now?

526
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I don't know that was the question. No, I actually I meant to hit Jay. I hate our JNK right next to each other. Well, I mean I'm Thor was okay

527
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So yeah, I enjoy bike

528
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But if you if you're having stream issues try to refresh the stream

529
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Refresh the game you're gonna say for having stream issues then Vikings aren't that good

530
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah, especially if you're on 720 then a good refresh the stream will probably help you out probably

531
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Vikings are even worse

532
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
How does it look by the way for anyone watching?

533
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
How like this is only the second time I've ever streamed in 720? Is it will be good?

534
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We sound good we look good we smell good and your internet's fine with that

535
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Apparently it wasn't last night. That's for sure

536
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I

537
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Not tried to stream 720 all the time

538
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
My internet just seems that it doesn't enjoy yeah, rather layback

539
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I if if all goes well then that's I mean last time it at 720 it seemed to work. Okay

540
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But last night I was trying to set it up because I usually stream on Saturday nights and it was just like no

541
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I could I could barely stream in 360 last night. I was like testing it by myself on listed

542
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Well private whatever and it was not happening

543
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
If you haven't stream problems after bad for you son I got 9 and 9 problems voter stream 8 1

544
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
No

545
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Go be

546
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I love your quote

547
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Hey, look at what I tell you just punching. Oh, you're not getting away

548
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
That was a shotgun

549
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
No, was it not okay?

550
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah, that was a my punched my fist and looked like a shotgun

551
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Oh my god, K off

552
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
There's like a line of soldiers waiting to mark your garden

553
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'll go not wait you go

554
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
What class is star star

555
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
There's a spy it's bomb

556
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'll spy what class is a what what what

557
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
What class is star he's a soldier. Sorry when that's by backstab me

558
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I had like like an aneurysm or something that was weird

559
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Don't do that. It's not good for you

560
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Many centuries fight. Oh, we got too many centuries and we got a spy

561
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I am almost there

562
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
81 kills on my market garden

563
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Hmm

564
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
81 81 nice nice nice nice nice nice nice

565
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Somebody asked him I'm gonna do another scary game face cam

566
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah, dude that game was horrible

567
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Horrible in the terms of I I completely I'm with you. I'm not good with scary

568
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Like just watching over. God, please. Why are you still going in?

569
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
We've agreed this is a bad idea

570
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It's you know what it's because I started I'll give you guys I give you the back story about that video

571
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So I started recording and I figured because I got a bunch of people asked me to do that

572
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Somebody was like oh do amnesia do SCP do this or that so I just was like you know

573
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm gonna do it. I feel like doing it and I got to a point where I was gonna turn it off

574
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I was like you know what I'm not gonna make this video like I just do something else like I'm not gonna make this video

575
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Because I sat down with it and then notice how the video started when I was like kind of down a tooth like I want to take 19 it sort of

576
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Fades out. Yeah, like I I just I pretty much get oh god. I'm lagging. Why? Oh

577
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
No, that's a door, but that's the door glitcher than you were talking about before

578
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
What's I I the video starts and I'm like already down two floors?

579
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
That's because I stopped recording and I just sitting there going I don't I can't do this

580
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I

581
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Really I really didn't think I could do it and then halfway through when I was actually recording

582
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You can you can see like in my face during the video. Oh my god over time. This is a pretty ridiculous fight

583
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I'll get back to that story in a second. We lost no

584
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Round ends as I'm in air that's markup going someone that's all that matters

585
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's all matters

586
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Nothing else matters

587
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But yeah, so I mean I I started to get to that point where I got that first spook the first like big jumping scare

588
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
For a second I was like, you know what I'm about to hit I'm not him gonna escape F9 and I'm not doing it

589
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That's what I said like you know what I can't give up like I have I'm already like halfway done with like this thing and that is

590
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
We'll finish it

591
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
When that guy comes out that's oh, I'm not gonna ruin it really if you never do

592
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It's it is it is terrifying

593
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It rage quits the game for you too. That's why like at the end of the video

594
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I look like somebody hit me in the face with a wrench after that

595
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I watched more videos of the game because like I wanted to figure out like how it ended or there was more

596
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yeah, I freaked out cuz

597
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Seriously like

598
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
What you saw at the end of that video was like a 100% genuine like my face

599
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I thought I didn't even know what was going on I freaked out and then I was just like wait what happened why am I did me?

600
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I was genuinely the funnel

601
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Live stream it

602
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Again keep playing it make like three more commentaries back in

603
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I will become known as the stairs simulator guy the stairs simulator

604
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You're on it

605
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Somebody was telling me to do a containment breach and I looked up a couple things on it. Oh my god. Oh

606
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
my god

607
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
That it just looks it looks it looks ten times worse than SCP. Oh, it's seven the regular one

608
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Oh, nice shot. I'm gonna go

609
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Bye

610
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Like that one is like actually 3d like creatures and weird like stuff. We're not really 3d, but it's

611
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I was scared playing Quake 4 so

612
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
This is the game you should not be scared playing

613
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Quake 4

614
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, there's this one room where there's like a giant beating heart and it's really dark

615
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And it took me like 20 minutes to get through but all you have to do is walk up some stairs and like the missions over

616
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I was like just crouch walking the whole time like nope nope

617
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Doing this

618
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Oh, we're gonna get up. I knew that was gonna happen

619
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I knew that was gonna happen

620
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But class what play the most probably engineer

621
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You get it actually we'll take a look you know can I do it from here?

622
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Stats here you go I've actually don't think I've ever shown this I didn't a Q and a one time but these are my team fortress two

623
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
stats

624
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And the reason why spy is so high is cuz back in like 2007

625
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Like that's all I played

626
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Got a spy I was looking my stats here today and I was disappointed with not much spy I played

627
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Mm-hmm like 35 hours when did I do that when did I waste that much time? Yeah, I have 138 hours to do that

628
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That's nothing though and also this is um I

629
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Think my stats got reset at some point like very early on in the game. Oh, yeah, I reset mine a while. Yeah

630
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
God there was one day where I was playing with bots and no one was playing with bots as I go I have to do this

631
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Spy spy on spy

632
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Whoa, whoa, no, I didn't want to hit end

633
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
All right team what do you say we do this come on let's go baby

634
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
We're all here in this together. Yeah

635
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Oh, I'll play spy

636
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
spy spy

637
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
But I want to be the cool kind of person to play spy

638
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I want to be the cool person oh

639
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Come on, I was trying to did I actually get away with that like I did not and

640
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh god, I was keeping people like right when they have no health how you do it?

641
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I knew I was gonna screw that up

642
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I knew I was gonna screw that up

643
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It's a bad attitude

644
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I did a dead space to video well technically, but I technically the grandpa has one on respawn

645
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It's a hole in this straw and I can't drink the rest of my iced tea

646
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
You're supposed to be a hole in it. That's how straws work. No, are you so glad I'm here?

647
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I am I

648
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It's hold on let me fix this stupid straw

649
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
There we go I did the I did the best thing I

650
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Flip the straw upside down and put it back in

651
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Genius, I know I am a genius already. I have no idea what we're going

652
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I should have just changed the map to begin with but I was too busy like not paying attention

653
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm a gold rush hopefully it's gold rush stars favorite map

654
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Like nowhere to jump I

655
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Love gold rush so much

656
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Actually, I did see one person you can do a jump on a second point second map of gold rush from like start to finish all the way through with one jump

657
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I'd probably just spend the entire round trying to do that

658
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And if I did it or team would win just instantly it's like getting a nuke

659
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That's like getting a nuke

660
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Somebody asked do I like yeah, I'm using the diamond back because I like it and plus it's just strange too

661
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So gotta use it if it's strange

662
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I think the diamond back has a bad wrap

663
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It's okay. I mean it's not it's

664
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
When you're fighting like 40 gunslinger and cheese. It's yeah

665
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Well, it's part of this way right so the the ambassador and the diamond back can do the same damage right the

666
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Ambassador shoots slower

667
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
The ambassador shoots 20% slower than the diamond back

668
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But you get crits on the headshots. I mean you get crits on this if like you said if there are many centuries around they I would say they have both good

669
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
A lot of people really bash on the diamond back. Well the best part about the diamond back is the sound

670
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Yeah, to mean technically it's it's like a better. It's a

671
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Default if you're not going for headshots. It's better than the ambassador if you can't get headshots. It's better than the ambassador for sure

672
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The ambassador is still though. It's it's so good. It's so good

673
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Oh, yeah playing that guitar. Oh, are you

674
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Why am I wearing that like Christmas item?

675
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I got to put my ring on and somebody gave me

676
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I like the Christmas heart thing on

677
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You're just I don't know you're hardy I'm a cold like a thing though. I

678
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Totally forgot the frying pan

679
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
The frying pan is oh

680
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
There's a mini century

681
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You're gonna take that out

682
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Do rank oh

683
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
screenshot post-or-read it screenshot screen. So I just screenshot. Why don't I need help am I doing

684
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I

685
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Hide behind the cut I

686
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Blue open a bush get over here get over here. Oh god

687
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
All right, here we go I

688
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Want to kill you

689
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Oh, oh my god, that was so I'm sorry dude. That was like a face stab in a half don't ask me how that happened

690
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Want that medical I want to kill that medic. I want that medic to heal me

691
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yeah, yeah, I'm disguised as you I know I know the deal. Oh, I tried a side stab and it never works because I'm too terrible with spot

692
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
What you spent all the hours no like a body block

693
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It's gonna be awesome

694
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Get fear three fear three three being scary. I don't think so I

695
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I heard it's pretty I heard it's got it's moments my roommate in college played he was like a big fan of fear one and two

696
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
He like praise the game all the time. I just never had time to play it. You know

697
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Oh line cast I got I got to talk about that I

Explaining what it actually is in like a vlog or something in the next couple days, but it's exciting

721
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It's really exciting. I haven't been able to talk about it. So my lips had to be sealed for the last couple weeks

722
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Yeah, maybe we'll get to go to E3 I need to do more secret things

723
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm doing something I can't talk a bit

724
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I need to do more secret stuff

725
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Please don't shoot me. Wow, that was an amazing shot

726
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Too bad he didn't kill me

727
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Yeah, total biscuit. Yeah, I forget their names. There's three like super super famous guys that are gonna be casting it on Twitch

728
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I don't know their names. I'm a total biscuit. That's it. Well, it doesn't matter. I just did a good rocket jump. That's all that matters

729
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
What what my my own fire?

730
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
What look at this what's going on? I can't look at this. Why am I on fire right now?

731
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
What is that? I had been a boost I

732
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I pulled up the dead ringer and I

733
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Oh, that was I think I just had like a brain fought right there because I pulled the dead ring around when he lit me and

734
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And it worked and then it instantly I why did I come out of it? Do you hear the noise? It was like oh, I came out of the dead ringer

735
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But I didn't I was still in it

736
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
It is not Renaissance heroes

737
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
It is or even online. I'm just gonna like ask him if I can like talk about it

738
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Can I be like hey, can I tell people what I'm doing?

739
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Where's it legal? Oh

740
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yeah, we were very cool for us to

741
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I

742
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Am gonna go off spy. I'm I'm too stupid right now to go to planning out

743
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Say hello to your Spanured viewers. I love everybody in Spain. Hope you guys are a good in that spanned land

744
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
The cool part is I want to go to you three. That's like the main thing is a man

745
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I could really care less about like winning the whole thing. How is you?

746
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I

747
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Could care less about winning like the whole thing, but I do it would be awesome to go to E3

748
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Because then I could make videos and stuff about going to E3 and

749
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
It would be so much fun

750
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Wow, that was a wow, I am sorry to every single person here that just got covered in that your body that was my fault

751
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh

752
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I'm got a quick fixed what am I doing I gotta get up here? What are you doing? Oh?

753
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Damn and oh

754
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Oh

755
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Oh, I

756
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Hear the Christmas bells

757
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Oh

758
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Need ammo

759
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I probably will do more morning streams well not really morning streams, but early afternoon streams on Sunday

760
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Just because I know that Saturday night can a lot of people can't watch it and I am sorry about that

761
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Oh

762
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Every time I see somebody in the air I always think it's you and I get scared

763
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Every time

764
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Anytime you're in anyone's in the air I

765
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Keep thinking it's you and it freaks me out

766
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
It's perfect

767
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Spawn to spawn

768
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Belly to belly the from for jump oh

769
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:29,000
You know what that's from back to back belly to belly. I think it's from where

00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego? I've really think it is the game show the old game show

00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Somebody please look that up somebody find that out for me right now

772

776
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000

779
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Star stars sounds a bit robotic. He said he's his internet's going up and down so

780
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000

781
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Not anymore though you sound fine now. Okay good

Have I killed one person this like entire time? How do I have 18 points?

783
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:39,000
What what did I do did I kill anybody? I guess so I don't even like remember killing anyone

784
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I did a jump I

785
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Did jump

786
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
My mommy was proud

787
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Well, I my I got my cat is like scratching the door

788
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I probably have

789
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
One of if not the most annoying cats in the world

790
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
See he he knows my window when it's open. He knows he can come over and annoy me by just going like

791
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Buh

792
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Until I gum let him in and if I don't let him in he will sit there

793
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
He probably wouldn't even eat or sleep until I let him in like through like the window

794
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yeah, he kiddin and it's like you know there's another way you can go right that you can't get in my window

795
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
He just knows I'll let him in

796
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Always leave it open

797
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
This is what time is right now

798
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
That's the real question

799
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I don't know

800
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Probably another round or two on TF and I think I'm gonna transition to some Diablo free

801
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000

00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
That was weird I got killed by a crit man. Oh, no, no, no, no, you know, it probably was like a

808
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Fuck banner the pp. Oh, probably was the pp banner

809
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000

814
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It's too hard

815
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Painting is hard

816
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Yeah, star does make rocket jumping look so much fun. He also makes it look really easy too, and it is absolutely not

817
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
One of the best videos I've ever seen of team fortress two is that video where you jumped

818
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
to do

819
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Where you jumped across like the whole thing a high tower and man tread in some pyro it was unbelievable

820
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I wasn't even that good. Oh, it was the best. I don't even know

821
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
When I finally put all these hard gardener kills together

822
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Well, when you finally put this box garden thing together I

823
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's probably gonna get like 700 million views. It's gonna be that good

824
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
The bomb is nearing a checkpoint

825
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000

826
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000

They're yeah YouTube streams are well, they're in beta. So there is always gonna be a lot of problems

830
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
But you know whatever it's all good

831
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,000

You gotta be good to be-

848

I think I've convinced my team not to try it all off.

849
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
You see like the pyro walking out there.

850
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
We're taking it easy.

851
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Ha-ha.

852
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Uh-oh.

853
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Card heavy is fun.

854
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yeah, okay.

855
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000

Card heavy is fun.

857
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I would to jump as card heavy.

858
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000

Yeah.

860
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
The best you could do is like,

861
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
mmm.

862
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Yeah. Go up the fronting urgently jumps.

863
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Here we go, ready?

864
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I'll show you how to like rocket jump as a heavy.

865
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Grouch!

866
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
See, look at off-fired, just went.

867
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Oh no, I'm almost out of my large Dunkin' Donuts fresh brewed iced tea.

868
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
That's not a good thing.

869
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Get another.

870
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I mean, I have to drive to Dunkin' Donuts.

871
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I wish I just had to get a Dunkin' Donuts in my house.

872
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Get it?

873
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Get a Dunkin' Donuts.

874
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Just buy my franchise.

875
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Just own it.

876
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Just so you can live in it.

877
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I would, I would.

878
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
If I find a house.

879
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I think I'm not even really a big coffee drinker.

880
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I as I love iced tea.

881
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And their iced tea is really, really good.

882
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Oh dear god.

883
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Hey awesome.

884
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Maybe I should shoot some things.

885
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I think I'm gonna shoot some things.

886
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Oh yeah?

887
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Yeah.

888
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I got, I got a ghost tree con.

889
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And they gave me hats.

890
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Ghost tree con.

891
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Yes.

892
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So now the class is I'm allowed to play in this is to rock a jumping soldier or one of the classes that got a hat.

893
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Is that game any good?

894
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
You played it.

895
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It's not out yet.

896
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
It sounded like a weak one.

897
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Oh, it's actually looking really good.

898
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Yeah, I heard it's supposed to be pretty...

899
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
There's hints.

900
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
They're going a different direction, aren't they?

901
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Whoa.

902
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
It's kind of funny that Ghost Recon is...

903
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I love the first one.

904
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Mm-hmm.

905
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And they have dumbed down the series a lot since then.

906
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And usually that would like piss me off to no end.

907
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
But for some reason this time I'm glad Ghost Recon is Dumber.

908
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Well, it's like the one game I'm happy about that it's Dumber.

909
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Wasn't the Ghost Recon series very, very strategic?

910
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Yeah, very hard for you.

911
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Like, you had a plenty of hard time planning groups.

912
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And this one, I mean it has all of that.

913
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
But for the most part, you know it's not gonna happen.

914
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Right.

915
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Right.

916
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
It's kind of like TF2.

917
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Hmm.

918
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
See, when I watch like Trial, it was a very serious thing.

919
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I've been around for years and more, a little bit.

920
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Like that kind of...

921
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It's like third person vibe around.

922
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Yeah, it's got that third person vibe to it.

923
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It's definitely...

924
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
It has like all the wall hugging mechanics that you guys would have.

925
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Hmm.

926
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
But I don't know, I actually wanted this game since the first of it showing single player trailers of it.

927
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
But multiplayer looks pretty fun.

928
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I love fun things.

929
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Yeah, definitely.

930
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I love fun stuff.

931
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I throw to PP.

932
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
All right, we'll do...

933
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I cannot get on that car.

934
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
What am I doing?

935
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Why don't I just pull that out?

936
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I'm gonna die.

937
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Why, what do I have this on for?

938
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Not this, it's a steal.

939
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I need to put those on.

940
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Turn around, you keep running in a circle, I know.

941
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I know.

942
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
That's what happens when I live stream.

943
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I...

944
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
My two senses in my brain fight with dominance.

945
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And I just like, walk around in circle, what happened?

946
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Now we get a wrangled...

947
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Century, a mini-century that is.

948
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Yikes.

949
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I think that's a spy.

950
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Oh, okay.

951
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Oh!

952
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I missed my melee swing because I was in his body.

953
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Oh, here's the other guy.

954
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Wait, sandwich, take it.

955
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Eat it.

956
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah.

957
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Come this way, come this way.

958
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
We're gonna go up, we're gonna go up top.

959
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And...

960
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Oh!

961
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Get on the car!

962
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And come on, somebody touch it!

963
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I should have stayed behind it.

964
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Yeah, but you didn't.

965
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
You know.

966
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I'm stupid.

967
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It's a one more round after this, and then we'll move on to some...

968
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Dwia below three.

969
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Okay.

970
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Oh.

971
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Oh!

972
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Take that!

973
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
And...

974
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I should have graduated.

975
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
That's it, no time.

976
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Oh, my...

977
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I should have given this sandwich.

978
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
My poor, medic friend.

979
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Let's meet the sandwich.

980
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
No!

981
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Ugh!

982
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I warned you.

983
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Mmm.

984
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
It was essentially a warning.

985
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
New reg.

986
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I'm sufficient.

987
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Kind of lethal.

988
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It's getting there.

989
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Oh, God, spy.

990
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yes, this will be on YouTube.

991
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And when I finish the stream, it'll probably be up there after maybe an hour to a processing.

992
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
So...

993
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I wish we would, what time is it right now?

994
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
It's 9.30am for me.

995
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Probably streamed for another couple hours or so.

996
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
At least another hour.

997
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And...

998
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It should be up by maybe...

999
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Nune-ish, maybe?

1000
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Yeah, so it doesn't upload things that they're really long.

1001
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
That's what it says.

1002
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I talked to some people and they said that apparently that's not true.

1003
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
That's not the case.

1004
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Yeah, I guess they're just a lie to you.

1005
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
It's like, oh, you can't upload an automatic stream longer than two hours.

1006
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And then people do it.

1007
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So I don't know.

1008
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I guess they would want to discourage everyone.

1009
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I don't know.

1010
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah, it's weird.

1011
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It's very weird.

1012
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Someone said, since when is Herblurga a warning?

1013
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Herblurga!

1014
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
It is.

1015
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Yeah, yeah, I could be seen as a warning.

1016
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Well, what else do you think I'm going to do if I'm screaming at it?

1017
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Um...

1018
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Besides...

1019
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I'm either on the toilet or about to kill you.

1020
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Oh man, they have too many things going on in there.

1021
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Watch out for the...

1022
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah, you take the sandwich.

1023
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
You need it.

1024
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Dude, eat sandwich.

1025
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I'm going to go around.

1026
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's all about...

1027
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
They only have a mini-century, man.

1028
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
We're getting pushed back by a mini-century and like a bunch of devil men.

1029
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Oh god, I'm so dead.

1030
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Oh god.

1031
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Why do I not have these out?

1032
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Somebody ask.

1033
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
All right, here we go.

1034
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Here we go.

1035
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
There we go.

1036
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Come on.

1037
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Come on.

1038
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Somebody help me.

1039
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I shot you with my gun.

1040
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
It was a bomb gun.

1041
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
A bomb gun. Is that new?

1042
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Yeah.

1043
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I hope I get it.

1044
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Cool.

1045
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I'm...

1046
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Village, you believe?

1047
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Oh, no, no.

1048
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I'm probably not going to switch servers, but some of you guys are asking only because star is in here.

1049
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
And I wouldn't want it to be like, oh, we both can't get into the same server.

1050
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
And plus I'm on my server, so...

1051
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I like playing on my server because I like playing with the dudes on my server because they're cool.

1052
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
For one more.

1053
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
What do you say?

1054
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Let's go to...

1055
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
No, no, no, no.

1056
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
No, let's go to good old gold rush.

1057
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Oh, please, no.

1058
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
All right, finally, fine.

1059
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Well, I'm trying to like figure out how to like do something fun.

1060
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Ah!

1061
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I slapped you.

1062
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I got you.

1063
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
You need to rapid fire that.

1064
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Oh, you can do that.

1065
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Yeah, if you just keep mashing the button, you can get slapped so much it like pops you up in the air.

1066
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Hold you there.

1067
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
All right, let's go.

1068
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Oh, you're going to be mad, but I kind of want to play on Turbine.

1069
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
You know what, a jump is...

1070
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I don't know, I just want to gelman.

1071
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Turbine!

1072
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I guess...

1073
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Turbine has stairs.

1074
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Wow, I just love Turbine.

1075
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I love a lot of things, don't I?

1076
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Should've played 2-4.

1077
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
2-4.

1078
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
But Turbine's like the good 2-4, isn't it?

1079
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
No, the 2-4 is the best 2-4.

1080
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Hahaha.

1081
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
You know, a 2-4 is the best 2-4.

1082
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I'll stick them all night.

1083
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Oh, it's my spray!

1084
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Ah, Derma!

1085
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Oh!

1086
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
This hero now hates you.

1087
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Gary monster.

1088
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Look what you did.

1089
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
What I do.

1090
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
What happened?

1091
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
You picked this map.

1092
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So?

1093
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
There's a ceiling on this map.

1094
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
There's nowhere that does not have a ceiling.

1095
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
You could do like an off the wall, kind of like move, can't you?

1096
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Hahaha.

1097
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Yeah.

1098
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah.

1099
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I don't know, I'll ask him.

1100
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Star, are you going to play Diablo 3 as well?

1101
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Yes, sir.

1102
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Yes, sir.

1103
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Yes, sir.

1104
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Team of Lyon.

1105
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Okay.

1106
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Oh, I hear a dog.

1107
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I think that might be my dog.

1108
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
My dog.

1109
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Oh.

1110
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Oh my god, a century.

1111
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
A strategy to turbine, hold mid.

1112
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
One game.

1113
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Oh.

1114
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
How used to- oh, you get an overview.

1115
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Makes sense.

1116
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Oh, damn it.

1117
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I was trying to go for a top kill on that map.

1118
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I never walk into corner.

1119
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Hahaha.

1120
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Why is this response so long?

1121
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I changed that.

1122
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
It's a respawn wave.

1123
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
It's a respawn wave time, right?

1124
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
It's a respawn on turbine.

1125
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
You can't?

1126
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It's too turbine.

1127
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
You could change the respawn.

1128
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Easy can.

1129
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I don't know.

1130
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I have my respawn wave time at two.

1131
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Isn't that supposed to be God, crits?

1132
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I thought I was going to bite my ankles in a second.

1133
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
He's probably going to run here.

1134
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Boom.

1135
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Boom.

1136
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Boom.

1137
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Oh, come on.

1138
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I want my crits.

1139
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I want my crits.

1140
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Let grandpa play Diablo.

1141
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I don't think he would get it.

1142
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I think he'd be too confused.

1143
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
There's too many numbers to deal with in Diablo.

1144
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
You don't just shoot people.

1145
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Well, that's why they made numbers off by default

1146
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
and you know advanced tooltips.

1147
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
People like him.

1148
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
What just happened?

1149
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
All right, so I charged with the charging charge.

1150
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And right when I clicked, right click,

1151
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I got backstabbed.

1152
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
And my body just like baseball slid across like the whole map.

1153
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I love getting backstabbed right as you were.

1154
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I could jump and your body just, poof, it's God.

1155
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Boom.

1156
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Boom.

1157
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Okay.

1158
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Let me say, let me find some dude to run into here.

1159
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Here's a mini-century.

1160
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Mm.

1161
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Help me.

1162
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I'm real ice-wear.

1163
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
That's a sticky.

1164
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
That's me getting shot.

1165
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
High right here.

1166
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I know a secret.

1167
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
What?

1168
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Here we go.

1169
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
This is what you do.

1170
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And then you just, what?

1171
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
What?

1172
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I was going to work on my secret technique

1173
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
and 20 seconds.

1174
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Hold on a minute.

1175
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Oh, actually, I was about to type in the server password.

1176
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Like, hold on, let me just type my arcon password right now

1177
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
in front of like 400 people.

1178
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Okay.

1179
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
No big bad idea.

1180
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
20, that's too long.

1181
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
20 seconds.

1182
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It's supposed to be like nine.

1183
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Come on.

1184
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Come on.

1185
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
It was turbine.

1186
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Oh, I had a knockback.

1187
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Get over here.

1188
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
It is morning.

1189
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
It is nine.

1190
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Just about 10 a.m. here in the East Coast, United States.

1191
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Oh, I've got it.

1192
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I thought it.

1193
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Oh, he only had like 2% health left.

1194
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
10% 20, whatever.

1195
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Oh, it killed a guy.

1196
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
This is why we can't have nice things.

1197
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Please, German.

1198
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Just please one two four.

1199
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I think two four is, I think I took it out of the rotation.

1200
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
All right.

1201
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
How about this?

1202
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Before I leave, I will switch the map to two four.

1203
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
How's that sound?

1204
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
That does not sound good.

1205
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Yeah, this guy does.

1206
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Oh, my God.

1207
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
That guy did not know that was coming.

1208
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Yeah, he was too busy hitting me.

1209
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Remember, if you crouch and just stand still

1210
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
when you're in melee fight, one on one,

1211
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
you're probably going to win.

1212
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Because people freak out too much.

1213
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
They run around, they go out.

1214
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
What is this?

1215
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And hey, open that door.

1216
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Whoa.

1217
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I'm going to get the intelligence.

1218
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
You know what, screw this.

1219
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Oh, never mind.

1220
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
He already got it.

1221
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Good job, Scout.

1222
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Good job, dude.

1223
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
You typed 25 comments and haven't gotten a cheeseburger yet?

1224
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I think there's a YouTube bug.

1225
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
You should have already gotten at least three cheeseburgers

1226
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
dispensed from your laptop.

1227
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Are you reading?

1228
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Well, just on the chat.

1229
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
The stream.

1230
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
How do you do that?

1231
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
It's in a, it's just, you make a...

1232
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I used to hold on to sorry, I can't even speak.

1233
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
To where stuff going on?

1234
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I'm sure I'm doing this dude.

1235
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
You just do update comments automatically,

1236
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
and they'll come in as they come in.

1237
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I think there's still like a minute or so behind,

1238
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
though that's the thing with YouTube.

1239
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
This isn't even pro-terbine.

1240
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
There's no banana.

1241
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Pro-terbine?

1242
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Yeah.

1243
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I'm pro-terbine.

1244
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
There's a banana.

1245
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Is that really?

1246
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Well, they call it banana,

1247
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
but it's like a different path on the side.

1248
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
It's shaped like a banana.

1249
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Yeah, you should get a double cheeseburger.

1250
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
You should come out of your...

1251
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
out of your CD tray.

1252
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Every 25 comments that you make on the stream.

1253
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
A double cheeseburger from your favorite restaurant

1254
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
comes out of your CD tray.

1255
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I don't have a CD tray.

1256
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
That's probably why it's not working.

1257
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Yeah.

1258
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
If you don't have a CD tray,

1259
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
oh, it's a zip drive too.

1260
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
You have to have like a zip drive.

1261
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Oh, God!

1262
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Dude!

1263
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Why am I still equipped?

1264
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Why is it still out?

1265
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Why do I still have this out?

1266
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
What am I doing?

1267
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I can't believe I got away with that.

1268
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Oh, right, God.

1269
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I can't believe I got away with that either.

1270
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I can't believe I can't almost be fucked.

1271
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Oh, that was a brigade.

1272
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Oh, I'm at the end of my drink.

1273
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
You know what that means.

1274
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
It's timed out.

1275
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
This thing is like floating.

1276
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
What the hell?

1277
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Your cheeseburger had blue cheese.

1278
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Sounds pretty dang good.

1279
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
All right, Star.

1280
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
You ready?

1281
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I got a question for you.

1282
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Oh, God.

1283
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
What is?

1284
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
It's over.

1285
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Oh, it's over.

1286
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
One more round.

1287
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
We'll do one more.

1288
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Not this map.

1289
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Please.

1290
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Please.

1291
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
All right, fine.

1292
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
We'll switch.

1293
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
All right.

1294
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
We'll go to Star.

1295
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Star, what map do you want to play?

1296
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Jump tricks.

1297
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
You want to play the jump map?

1298
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I don't even think I have an installed.

1299
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
We could play.

1300
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
All right, it needs to be like in like the team fortress database.

1301
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Thank you.

1302
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Like Frontier.

1303
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Frontier?

1304
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Yeah, I'm glad that was.

1305
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
And here we go.

1306
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
You cheeseburger had a green bun.

1307
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Well, that's definitely a good one.

1308
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
You're going to ask me a thing.

1309
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Was that the thing?

1310
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Oh, yeah, I forgot the thing.

1311
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I was going to ask you.

1312
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Oh, must have been important.

1313
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Probably was really, really important.

1314
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Yeah, one round of Frontier.

1315
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
And that'll end the team fortress for the day.

1316
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Then it will bond to Diablo 3 for a little while.

1317
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I was trying to think of good stock payload maps.

1318
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
That aren't upward.

1319
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
And my mind just blanked and I said Frontier.

1320
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
All right, ready?

1321
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Ready?

1322
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Ready?

1323
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Ready?

1324
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Let's go.

1325
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Let's go blue.

1326
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Go blue.

1327
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I'm going to play an attic.

1328
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Because I kind of feel like it.

1329
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I like this setup.

1330
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I'm going to stick with it.

1331
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Except I don't want the crits.

1332
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I want the default Medigun.

1333
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
There we go.

1334
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
You got to keep controlling your T.

1335
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
You have snipers humping the door.

1336
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
What is this?

1337
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Spray.

1338
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Mission begins in 500 seconds.

1339
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
That would be nice.

1340
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I'm going to play a little bit more.

1341
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
There's a sign out here that's a speed limit 15.

1342
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Speed limit 15?

1343
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Pwww.

1344
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
How?

1345
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Five, four!

1346
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Three, two!

1347
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
30.

1348
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
So, have you guys been able to hear the in game?

1349
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I'm sorry.

1350
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I don't want to watch that.

1351
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,000
30. So have you guys been able to hear the in-game audio like the explosions and stuff?

1352
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Or is that been too low? I'm always so afraid to turn that up because I feel like it's gonna open power everything I say.

1353
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I think I'm gonna get crits which is perfect because then how could I possibly miss a market card?

1354
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
All right, who am I gonna give this to? I don't even know.

1355
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
We'll go with the uh...

1356
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I know he's our doing one. Let's go this way.

1357
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Oh my god! Oh god! Oh god!

1358
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Wow!

1359
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Come here! Come here!

1360
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Oh god!

1361
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
We're good, we're good.

1362
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
You're good.

1363
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Oh no! I was my hand! My right click...

1364
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Did you drop Uber?

1365
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
My right click was clicking all in the Uber. It was like...

1366
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
And I got backstabbed.

1367
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Oh, dammit.

1368
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Get on that cat.

1369
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Oh no, that's you.

1370
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I can't believe that no work.

1371
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I don't even know if it was you because there was like three medics.

1372
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Maybe two? I can't count.

1373
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Give me that Uber. Give me that Uber.

1374
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
All right, I'm not gonna...

1375
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Oh, now I better watch out.

1376
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I'm doing it right away.

1377
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Come on, heavy.

1378
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
And...

1379
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Team Uber!

1380
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I'm hiding.

1381
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Everyone is safe now.

1382
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Oh!

1383
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Bleh!

1384
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Come on, give me another Uber.

1385
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Oh god! Two spies! That's not gonna work!

1386
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Uh-huh, I'm in on my head right now.

1387
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Spies? A spy? A spy.

1388
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Help me?

1389
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
No one stay alive?

1390
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
This guy...

1391
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Oh my god, you were about to die.

1392
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Oh, I had to use it.

1393
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
That was really early.

1394
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I used chain to say I know you.

1395
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
This guy...oh, yeah, well look what we just did.

1396
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
We just came like that.

1397
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
We did a good job.

1398
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Well, I saw this guy only had like one percent health.

1399
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And if I didn't use it, he would have died.

1400
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
And it was only me and a sniper behind him, so...

1401
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
When will the next grandpa video be uploaded?

1402
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
It was uploaded last night.

1403
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
The Shinema Reesmon.

1404
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
It's on the featured video list.

1405
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Go check it out.

1406
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Actually, to be honest, I'm sorry.

1407
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I didn't even let anybody know that was there.

1408
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I'll do that today.

1409
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
After this is over.

1410
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Oh!

1411
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Oh!

1412
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
This is bad.

1413
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
The tension.

1414
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
What do you find out?

1415
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I guess I do have two kills.

1416
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
No, come here Mark.

1417
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Let me hear you.

1418
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Oh, backed up into a knife.

1419
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Cck!

1420
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Somebody wants me to say a dirty word.

1421
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Hidden?

1422
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Don't do it!

1423
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Don't do it!

1424
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
It's hidden in like a regular sentence.

1425
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I know that.

1426
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I know that trick.

1427
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
That's a dirty trick.

1428
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
If you chat us frozen, try and refresh the page.

1429
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Reexac.

1430
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:54,000
exactly what exactly can fix

1431
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
and

1432
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000

1433
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
please

1434
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
all this is so good I love this thing

1435
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,000
doesn't seem like much but the overdose doesn't seem like much but it is

1436
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,000
really helps in situations a lot of situations it helps

1437
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
it's not that much it is though

1438
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
what you need is the blue solid

1439
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
yeah but then you start to take damage like you you don't get the full plus the

1440
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
level you just have to make sure you hit every needle

1441
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
but that's too hard and you are gonna land right on my face

1442
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
now I'm gonna back up like a punk not gonna

1443
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
like what you don't want to die

1444
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
see like I'm running fast

1445
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000

1447
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000

1448
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
oh no oh did I just totally block you from that

1449
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I actually apologize if I could

1450

1471
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:45,000
that's my philosophy and apparently grandpa 30th century set up

1472
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
you guys have a lot of stuff over there

1473
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,000
you don't even know yet because it's set up like four miles away

1474
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
you need a time to prepare and put it in a really really lame

1475
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
century spot

1476
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
so a name

1477
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000

1479
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:11,000
oh I backed up into another life

1480
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
backed up

1481
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
backed it up

1482
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
backed up

1483
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
that's the way

1484
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,000
you are up top there and I'm going to die

1485
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,000
man these spies are really making me paranoid

1486
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,000
there's like $4,00 of them I mean two

1487
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
these went back here somewhere

1488
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Oh, there is.

1489
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Well, I was gonna heal that guy too.

1490
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
My God!

1491
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Alright, I am not turning my back.

1492
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I'm gonna face this way the whole time.

1493
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
See? I knew it.

1494
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Get out of there.

1495
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Oh, overdose. You are my friend.

1496
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
It's all in your mind.

1497
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Yeah, but even if it is all in my mind, it still makes me get that extra mile.

1498
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
In your mind.

1499
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Oh, my God. I can't heal you all.

1500
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Trying.

1501
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Alright, let's push this thing.

1502
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Is anybody get up there?

1503
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Somebody get up there.

1504
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
There we go. There we go.

1505
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
There we go.

1506
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Push little wagon.

1507
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
You prepared for lame sentry?

1508
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Are you mentally ready for this?

1509
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Is there like a bunch there?

1510
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Sorry, sorry, it's by. I got you.

1511
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I got you.

1512
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I'll make sure you have a nice thick overheal.

1513
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
By the time you get out of here,

1514
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
and by the time I'm not afraid to leave,

1515
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
which is right now.

1516
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
There's a lot of people here.

1517
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Oh, no. No. No.

1518
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Heal me. Heal me.

1519
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Please. Oh, damn it.

1520
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I'm gun.

1521
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
That was pretty nice run though.

1522
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I'm proud of that little run.

1523
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Proud.

1524
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
People say you should try to pan me.

1525
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Um, I am missing every single marker garden.

1526
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Oh, that was a glitch.

1527
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Oh, that's why. That's not.

1528
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Why it looks like he's running slower, that was weird.

1529
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Oh, he got you.

1530
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I gotta get up. Move up. Move up. No, come here.

1531
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Move that gear up.

1532
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Oh, it's our center, young.

1533
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Oh, damn it.

1534
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I believe it is.

1535
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
We got three medics too. We should be pushing this cart like crazy.

1536
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
We need 14 heavies.

1537
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
We only have one. And there was his spine right there.

1538
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
That's why I'm waiting for him to come over here.

1539
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
He has no head either. Where's his head?

1540
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Where's this guy's head?

1541
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Yeah, I've been noticing that a lot lately.

1542
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Is that just on spies?

1543
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Yeah, if a spy disguises as a pyro and they're wearing a certain hat,

1544
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
it can't display the hat.

1545
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Oh, please. Or something like that.

1546
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Oh, God. That guy is over at the same time as me.

1547
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
We just both over the same guy at the same time.

1548
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Damn it.

1549
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I'm going for it. I'm going for some not-so stuff right here.

1550
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
What on slaper because we had none. Now we have three.

1551
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I could say higher number.

1552
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
That guy only needed one hit and I didn't get it.

1553
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
What movies were films in my planet on seeing?

1554
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Probably.

1555
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I still haven't seen the Avengers.

1556
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I have to see the Avengers.

1557
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Have you seen that star?

1558
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Is it good?

1559
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Yes or no?

1560
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
It's good because there's explosions.

1561
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
But I had like a two hour long conversation with someone about why it's terrible.

1562
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Really?

1563
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
There's nothing makes sense.

1564
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
If you watch it, you need to question everything that happens and say why is this happening.

1565
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
And you will realize you don't know.

1566
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Nobody knows.

1567
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
The Avengers.

1568
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I don't really watch a whole lot of movies, to be honest.

1569
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Dark Knight.

1570
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Yeah, that's definitely one.

1571
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
I mean, you have to see that though.

1572
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
That's pretty much-

1573
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,000
It's pretty much a moral obligation for every human being to watch the Crystal Moon Batman movies.

1574
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
You know you're ubering a spy?

1575
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Yeah, I know.

1576
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I'm aware of that.

1577
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I realize that like about two or three seconds into that uber.

1578
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I just thought I'd let you know.

1579
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yeah, I realized it because I realized especially when you ran the other direction when I ubered him when he turned left and when he went backwards.

1580
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I was like wait, I didn't fight that way.

1581
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
What are you doing?

1582
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
You could just have uberphobia.

1583
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Good.

1584
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Do I read any books?

1585
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I do not.

1586
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I don't really.

1587
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Actually, I take that back.

1588
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I read some times.

1589
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I read like graphic novels.

1590
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Does that count?

1591
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Oh.

1592
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
That does not count.

1593
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
But there's words in there.

1594
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
There's like, uh, Doug Tenepple.

1595
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
That makes good ones.

1596
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Oh!

1597
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Doug Tenepple makes great, great graphic novels.

1598
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
The Earthworm Genie guy.

1599
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Oh.

1600
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I didn't know he did that.

1601
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Yeah, they're pretty good.

1602
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
At least like the art is very, very interesting, really awesome.

1603
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I got you.

1604
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I got you.

1605
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I got you.

1606
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I got you.

1607
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Ball and Colin.

1608
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
You need help more than anybody.

1609
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I'll make sure to get you.

1610
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Oh my god.

1611
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
All right, you know what?

1612
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
No more medic.

1613
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Knit is pyro time.

1614
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Wanna see my backpack?

1615
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Here you go.

1616
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
It's kind of all over the place right now.

1617
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Ever since I gave everything away.

1618
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I don't have any more like cool hats.

1619
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Okay, I should stop doing this.

1620
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I'm actually shoot bullets.

1621
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Why I got to take that teleporter.

1622
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Am I doing?

1623
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Spies!

1624
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Spies, I don't know match for the pyro.

1625
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I'm gonna go that way.

1626
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I gotta go step sometimes.

1627
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1628
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Oh, come on!

1629
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Where did he even go from?

1630
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I have zero unusuals.

1631
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Bad player.

1632
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I don't know how you guys are winning more.

1633
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Well, we only have one minute.

1634
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
That's pretty much the end right there.

1635
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Do I still like the gorillas?

1636
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Oh my god, yes.

1637
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Gorillas are the best band like ever.

1638
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
We're not gonna win this.

1639
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Too much good stuff happening on it.

1640
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
As a center, we lost.

1641
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
It's over.

1642
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
It is over.

1643
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
So in that case, you know, you always gotta do this.

1644
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
You always gotta go spy.

1645
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
The sky's as an enemy heavy or something.

1646
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Well, you know how I'm gonna play.

1647
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I'm gonna go scout just so I can run away.

1648
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
I'm gonna take the coward way out.

1649
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Why am I taking the teleporter to the sky?

1650
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
So this is where we transition.

1651
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
What?

1652
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Oh, what?

1653
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Can we maybe?

1654
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Maybe I can get in there.

1655
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I think our center still has a cool.

1656
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Ah, it's down.

1657
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Yeah, it's over.

1658
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
It's over.

1659
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Time to move on to some Diablo 3.

1660
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Oh my god, are we gonna find items?

1661
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
We're gold.

1662
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Uh, hopefully gold, because I need more.

1663
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
No, we lost.

1664
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Yeah, just please, I hope I don't find any items.

1665
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
It's just gold.

1666
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Yeah, we love it, yeah.

1667
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Oh, all right.

1668
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Well, thanks, guys, for playing.

1669
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,000
If you got in, thank you.

1670
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
And time to transition to Diablo 3.

1671
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
If you just came, if you're wondering,

1672
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
oh, but it's over, no.

1673
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
It's this is all gonna be on YouTube later on today.

1674
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
So, yeah.

1675
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Uh, thanks, playing dudes.

1676
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Let's go onto Diablo 3.

1677
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
This is where we go.

1678
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Disconnect.

1679
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
We go.

1680
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Disconnect.

1681
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
We go.

1682
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Disconnect.

1683
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Yes, oh, do you sure?

1684
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I don't know.

1685
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I have replays.

1686
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
I don't want to lose.

1687
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
All right, now.

1688
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Diablo 3.

1689
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Supermoney and I combat.

1690
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
It's.

1691
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
I can't, I can't get into it.

1692
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
It's, I don't know what it is.

1693
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I'm not sure.

1694
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
I have a couple of friends now that are really starting to enjoy it.

1695
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
But I just can't.

1696
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I don't know.

1697
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
They did just add a new game mode, which is weird.

1698
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
It's kind of like realism.

1699
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I guess where everybody dies quicker.

1700
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Really?

1701
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Yeah.

1702
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
I just, I need to get into it at some point.

1703
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Maybe I'm not sure yet.

1704
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
But is this even in the right spot?

1705
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I think it is.

1706
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Not quite.

1707
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Hold on.

1708
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
I'm going to scream.

1709
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I've got to go black for a second.

1710
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Dudes.

1711
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
You can even rocket jump in that game.

1712
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
And I still don't like it that much.

1713
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
So.

1714
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
I don't know what else there could be to encourage me to play.

1715
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Maybe hats.

1716
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Ooh.

1717
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
There are hats.

1718
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I don't know what else there could be to encourage me to play.

1719
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
There are hats.

1720
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Then yeah.

1721
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
That's a good way to play.

1722
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Screen region.

1723
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Yeah.

1724
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Let's read.

1725
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Is that.

1726
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
And.

1727
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:06,000
You know you can stream with DX story.

1728
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
And it's better.

1729
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Screen region.

1730
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Really?

1731
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Yeah.

1732
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Whoa.

1733
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Streams option.

1734
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Oh my god.

1735
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Oh my god.

1736
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Do you use DX story?

1737
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Oh yeah.

1738
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Yeah.

1739
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Yeah.

1740
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I don't stream with it though.

1741
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
You should.

1742
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Oh my god.

1743
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Every time I try to bring this stupid window right now, it will be magic.

1744
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
All right.

1745
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I'm going to try this in one more time because this is being ridiculous.

1746
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Okay.

1747
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Streams option media.

1748
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
That was just like, I felt like I was looking through a tunnel right there.

1749
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
That might like, I'm going to like puke.

1750
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Okay.

1751
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Love of everything that is sacred.

1752
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Can we get this in the right spot?

1753
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Yes.

1754
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Okay.

1755
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
That's good enough.

1756
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Good enough.

1757
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
All right.

1758
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Nobody like steal my password.

1759
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Stolen.

1760
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Hacked.

1761
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Nobody steal my stuff because I have like a book.

1762
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I have like really good stuff.

1763
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
No I don't.

1764
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
I don't.

1765
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I don't know.

1766
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I don't know.

1767
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I don't know.

1768
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I don't know.

1769
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I don't know.

1770
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
I don't know.

1771
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I don't know.

1772
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I don't know.

1773
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I don't know.

1774
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
I don't know.

1775
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I don't know.

1776
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I don't.

1777
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
All right.

1778
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I'm on Nightmare.

1779
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Oh you like my like what you talk to name?

1780
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Bergola.

1781
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
He's the burglar.

1782
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Are you an eye in a game?

1783
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I'm not in a game.

1784
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I'm on X3 Nightmare.

1785
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
No.

1786
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
That's...

1787
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I'm further than that.

1788
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Well you have to come help me.

1789
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Okay.

1790
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
You have to.

1791
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Okay.

1792
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Make sure everything's on.

1793
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Make sure you don't want to just kill Asman four thousand times.

1794
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
That's what I find.

1795
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Now we're going to make this game where you don't have to run the same bosses open over again.

1796
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Then we're going to make Asman and give you all the experience.

1797
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Every single cent of experience I want in my bank account.

1798
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:10,000
So for Holan I got to get over like the Diablo 3 lag for the first two minutes and just

1799
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
do it in random moves.

1800
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I wonder.

1801
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
You know this got to be a reason why that happens.

1802
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,000
It has to be because it's syncing you up with like the DRM or something like that.

1803
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
It has to be.

1804
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
I don't know.

1805
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
But you need to invite me.

1806
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Oh that's right.

1807
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Star.

1808
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
You can invite to party.

1809
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Invite to the party.

1810
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Yeah.

1811
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
And now I'm going to reject it and be cool.

1812
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Oh.

1813
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
But please be like friends.

1814
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Nah.

1815
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Turn Bergola.

1816
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
The turn Bergola.

1817
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I made his name Bergola because of like Berga boy.

1818
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Oh yeah.

1819
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Yeah.

1820
01:34:51,000 --> 01:35:00,000
You got to get rid of the initial lag of Diablo 3.

1821
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Ho ho hooray.

1822
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Alright.

1823
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I think we can do it.

1824
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Well it's the.

1825
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Well it's the reason why it lags is even when I'm not streaming when I'm just playing just by myself.

1826
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
The first like two or three minutes every time you play Diablo 3 for some reason it just does this.

1827
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Yeah.

1828
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Do a new move and it's like wait what is this?

1829
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Yeah you have to like let it load Diablo 3 or anything.

1830
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
It's sort of like Minecraft.

1831
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
That's like the only way I can really make an assumption to what it's kind of like.

1832
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
You know what Minecraft is like when you first start playing it's like loading every single thing in the world.

1833
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
See like no I have to load all this stuff.

1834
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
It'll even out in a minute.

1835
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I promise.

1836
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Oh I did level a lot more in here.

1837
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I didn't even.

1838
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Oh no I'm still like.

1839
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
You know what's a good game.

1840
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Medium pizza.

1841
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Medium-alogious cheese pizza.

1842
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Yes.

1843
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Well pizza.

1844
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Now let's go.

1845
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Let's go with the lag.

1846
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Alright.

1847
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I want to get some rays and some uniques.

1848
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
People are still seeing streamception.

1849
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
No they're not in this.

1850
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Or is that just an old comment from somebody from a while back?

1851
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I don't shoot arrows anymore.

1852
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I'm not a second.

1853
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
What's going on?

1854
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
People are still in there seeing.

1855
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Shouldn't be.

1856
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Let me watch my own stream.

1857
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Make sure nothing's happening.

1858
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
You should stream with the X-Tore.

1859
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I gave the recommendation.

1860
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I should stream the stocks.

1861
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Teach you in two seconds.

1862
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Every time I stream when I did the exploit game stream thing.

1863
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
For some reason I don't know why.

1864
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
It lags.

1865
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
It lags really really terribly.

1866
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Oh no we're not getting streamception.

1867
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
It looks okay.

1868
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
What about 720?

1869
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
That looks okay too.

1870
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Okay.

1871
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Just making sure nothing was happening.

1872
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,000
It's probably the YouTube comment system like all slow and dumb.

1873
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
That's what it is.

1874
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:23,000
So I'm playing which doctor?

1875
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Which doctor is very fun?

1876
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Very good.

1877
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Very cool.

1878
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I am shooting bombs.

1879
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Bombs?

1880
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
There's actually a pretty cool build with Demon Hunter.

1881
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I found out that we just regenerate hatred like ridiculous amounts of it.

1882
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
We could use cluster arrow nonstop.

1883
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Really?

1884
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
That's a really cool.

1885
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Pretty damn cool.

1886
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Pretty snazzy.

1887
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Pretty snazzy.

1888
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
This guy is an elite in these.

1889
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Did he kill my little buddy?

1890
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Oh he's back.

1891
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I'm feeling maybe I shouldn't even be helping you.

1892
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Why?

1893
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
I don't know.

1894
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I've got a 50-300 damage.

1895
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
It feels wrong.

1896
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
But I need the help.

1897
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Get out of here.

1898
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Already a rare.

1899
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Really didn't think this would happen.

1900
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I thought it was just going to be the sea of blue.

1901
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
But I want one.

1902
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
What do I think of the Spider-Man reboot?

1903
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I think it's um...

1904
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Not out yet.

1905
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Yeah, it's not out yet.

1906
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I don't know.

1907
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I thought it was going to be like a Christopher Nolan type reboot.

1908
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,000
But it's kind of everything's like I'll see GIE and stuff.

1909
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I don't want to see it.

1910
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I don't know, man.

1911
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I'll probably see it.

1912
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Leave Spider-Man alone.

1913
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Leave Spider-Man alone.

1914
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I'll probably watch it to be honest.

1915
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
The first movie.

1916
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Second one was good too.

1917
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Oh, good way.

1918
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Hopefully this time they do anything with Venom.

1919
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Even later on, please not like a total D-bag.

1920
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Anything like that?

1921
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Venom.

1922
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
I have a cool face and giant teeth, but I pull my mask back to talk.

1923
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Thanks.

1924
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Yeah, I didn't really like the way they handled Venom either.

1925
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
It was kind of lack of luck.

1926
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Maybe if you took Venom's girlfriend or something, I don't remember what his deal was.

1927
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Wasn't he also in the...

1928
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Only in the movie for like 25 minutes, the actual Venom like Zimbeet Monsters thing?

1929
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
That's less than that.

1930
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
That's not...

1931
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
And the way he beats him, he's like, oh, I gotta humiliate a guy like that.

1932
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Why, why you gotta be like that?

1933
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I thought you were a good guy, Spider-Man.

1934
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:58,000
But if you guys wanna see my ruins, I'll give you a little look-see.

1935
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Look-see-do.

1936
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
So this is Poison, I'm using Poison Dart and Firebats.

1937
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
And I have it, so it's just pretty much pure damage.

1938
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,000
So if you take a look Poison Dart, I have it, so it's the fire one.

1939
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
So it just does more straight up damage every time you hit somebody.

1940
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
I'm not gonna pop up, apparently.

1941
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1942
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1943
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Then Firebats, I have the Poison ones.

1944
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Actually, I got a new one.

1945
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
I have ferrets.

1946
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Hmm, I'll stick with the Poison ones for now, I think.

1947
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Ferrets.

1948
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I got the gargantuan, the one that goes crazy when there's more than a few people around.

1949
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Yeah.

1950
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
I got, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1951
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Soul Harvest, because it is just too good for not having-

1952
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
How much intelligence is it giving you now?

1953
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
102 for every enemy affected.

1954
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,000
So I can get a 550 in intelligence if I get 5 people.

1955
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Oh, that's a lot.

1956
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Masking fusion and then Spirit Walk.

1957
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Masking fusion makes everyone hit themselves pretty much.

1958
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:06,000
And Spirit Walk is just amazing, because it makes you pretty much unkillable.

1959
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
You just go like this, you go, and you run around.

1960
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Very, very awesome.

1961
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
So you have ferrets.

1962
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I don't have ferrets, let me turn on my uh...

1963
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Ferrets.

1964
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Take this a little bit, my GPU.

1965
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Fan a little higher.

1966
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Yikes.

1967
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Okay.

1968
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Just to make sure.

1969
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
All right, we gotta go, we gotta find-

1970
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
This is the spider lady, isn't it?

1971
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Um...

1972
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Yeah.

1973
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
We used down a way still.

1974
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Yeah, we- we missed her.

1975
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
We missed her.

1976
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
All right, if you were just here for the TF2, then take it easy, man.

1977
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Thank you.

1978
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Give me this gold.

1979
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
My ferrets.

1980
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
They pick up gold for me.

1981
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Do they really?

1982
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Yeah, the most important skill in the game is pick up gold.

1983
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
That is a really important skill, because you have to like go move over and run over it.

1984
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
And then crease gold find, just for being ferrets.

1985
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Like I didn't know ferrets did that.

1986
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
But they're rolling in it.

1987
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Rolling in those ferrets.

1988
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
So we went the wrong way.

1989
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
It's Diablo 3.

1990
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
That's the name of the game in D3.

1991
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Going the wrong way.

1992
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
It almost feels sometimes like...

1993
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
It generates the map as you go somewhere.

1994
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
And people- he went this way.

1995
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
It looks generated so it's a lot better every time.

1996
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So many little spite of freaks.

1997
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Oh god.

1998
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Come on, go get him, Godganchoin.

1999
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:52,000
So though we were talking about the Godganchoin, the little buddy that I have for a pet.

2000
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Yeah, we better run this.

2001
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And we can't have the conclusion that this is what he's doing.

2002
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
So I'll try and do the voice.

2003
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,000
I don't know if we can get it through this fight.

2004
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Is it ready?

2005
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
So this is- look at how like cutie is.

2006
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
So, we're ready just like...

2007
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Where's... where's Jess?

2008
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Where's she-

2009
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Hey!

2010
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

2011
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
That's the noise he's making when he runs.

2012
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
And he's got a diaper.

2013
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
I hit this guy, I help you.

2014
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Oh, ow, that hurts.

2015
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I know.

2016
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I just feel like his big dumb cute.

2017
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
But I'm going to die doesn't he leap right here.

2018
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:47,000
It's okay. I'll hold you. Yikes. Confusion! Alright let's get a rare. So yeah I thought I had a

2019
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,000
really cool skill that could rival your mask confusion because it knocks everything back for

2020
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:59,000
like 10 seconds. Rarely. It doesn't work on rares. Really? Like all rares are immune to knockback.

2021
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:07,000
That's kind of BS. Yeah I was kind of gonna go like all knockback demon under because Diablo 2.

2022
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I probably still am. It's just kind of like same rares are gonna be like this okay.

2023
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:18,000
You're gonna tell me you might get one. Back up a little bit.

2024
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Hey Jeremy can you make a shout out to Edgel? Like in the stream? Just say your name. What's up Edgel?

2025
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I think it's Brown's eagle. Eagle? Eagle. Eagle Waffles. Yes. Oh God yes please. I actually don't like

2026
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Waffles. I go Waffles at least. I know that's blasphemous. I know. Like Belgium Waffles are better

2027
01:44:51,000 --> 01:45:01,000
naturally. I mean. I mean Waffles are just two. It's almost like too much. It's too doughy

2028
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:10,000
ready for me. Same thing with pancakes. I'm not a big pancake person either. Wow. I did not need to

2029
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:16,000
know that about you. I don't think anyone you just know that about you. Like everyone is leaving

2030
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:23,000
the stream right now because I said that. Yeah. What's the point of watching this? This guy

2031
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:30,000
doesn't even like pancakes. I thought we could like bond on some sort of human level but apparently not.

2032
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:39,000
I thought we were gonna be friends. Why would I want to be friends with you now? I need help. Do I have

2033
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:45,000
any potions that I'm not using? I gotta run back to town real quick. You don't like pancakes

2034
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:54,000
unsubbed. No I love pancakes. Come back. I resolved my joke. You know I the only pancakes I like are

2035
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:02,000
chocolate chip pancakes. That's it. Oh. Everything else I'm not a big fan of. Are you just like trying to

2036
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
run your name into the ground? But chocolate chip pancakes are really good. What's wrong with that?

2037
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Chocolate chip pancakes. This is a breakfast food we were talking about. You want to put chocolate chips

2038
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:19,000
in. Would you put like chocolate chips and scrambled eggs and be like, oh good idea. Yeah but

2039
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:27,000
shrimp eggs are like eggs. They're not like pancakes are sweet. You know let me give you a

2040
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:34,000
rebuttal. Would you put cheese on your pancakes? I'm sure that wouldn't be that bad. I don't think so.

2041
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I don't know about that. What does cheese go badly with besides chocolate chips? I'm like a glass

2042
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,000
of chocolate milk. I feel like put easy cheese in it. Well besides anything chocolate.

2043
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Well when does chocolate go bad? You just made my point for me.

2044
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I'm trying to say chocolate doesn't go with anything. You just eat chocolate.

2045
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Chocolate. Chocolate ice cream. Chocolate milkshake. Chocolate strawberries. Yeah those are

2046
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:17,000
all but the point is I'm right. I just had to go back to town again because I forgot. I've

2047
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:27,000
went here to buy potions and I didn't. Chocolate chip pancakes. That's the best part about the

2048
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
apple tree. Is what? Is it time to consider the important parts of life? But we weren't talking

2049
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:37,000
about this one playing TF2 but now we're down to the root. Well now we have a little it's a little

2050
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:43,000
more laid back. We get some time to discuss things. Layed back. It's a little more laid back. I would

2051
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:52,000
consider this more serious. This is so serious it's Diablo. Here I am clicking on things and you're

2052
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,000
in town clicking on things. This is the most serious thing I've done in my life. Oh snake. Oh

2053
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:04,000
whatever I'm just gonna come meet you. Yeah this is act 3 nightmare if you guys are wondering.

2054
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
This is the character I don't have this character in hell. He's only 46. He's little.

2055
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,000
And you are I had I need to come up and find you. Yeah I figured you'd spawn on me.

2056
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Well I don't assume that I'm that intelligent. Okay sorry.

2057
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:27,000
I've never been to Comic Con. I kind of want to go. It'd be really fun. Oh there's an elite right there.

2058
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Not cool. Yeah. That guy. Comic Con is really interesting because it's isn't Comic Con not just

2059
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,000
like comics. It's like pretty much about everything isn't it? Kind of a little bit everything.

2060
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:49,000
They have a lot of movie stuff there too and I don't know. I could have gone once but I

2061
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:55,000
didn't. I might go to one eventually. This is one on in New York right? New York and in Chicago.

2062
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,000
I probably go to the New York one if I can have the chance. If I had like the money.

2063
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Did that's the most important thing. Go into all these events it costs money and that's just

2064
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:20,000
the money that I don't have. Oh my god Gatch one. I need more health. I only have like 11,000 or so.

2065
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I have 12,000. Somebody wants to know treasure. Oh god treasure goblin really? Get him. Get him.

2066
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I have some blues. No no no this is not good at all. Mask confusion. Get him. They're oh god this is just chaos.

2067
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:47,000
He's dead. Oh he dropped a rare. Yay nightmare rare. Oh I'm about to die. Oh run away run away run away.

2068
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Totally there. I'm going to jail you and then mortar you.

2069
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:59,000
So what I was going to say is somebody wants to know if you're going to continue your Let's Play.

2070
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:05,000
They want to know there because they want to see the whole story they said. Oh Diablo 3. Yeah. I was going to upload one last night.

2071
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I actually did upload one apparently never finished rendering so it was like a fourth of a video.

2072
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,000
That's the worst thing. See this video the one that right when this is the stream is done.

2073
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Once it gets uploaded to YouTube it is going to take like two hours to process. It's just like yeah.

2074
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I wish there was a way we did a full circle. We did but that's we need to XP and we need to add them.

2075
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Oh I didn't even identify the but oh this is one hander. Oh.

2076
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Oh this is not a posterity on it though but this is actually pretty good.

2077
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Do you want to know? Okay I have this thing that I found. It's a blue so you know it's good.

2078
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Go over here. Do you want to look at this? Is this thing better than what you have?

2079
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:57,000
I know I mean you could maybe use that. Oh geez. That is not better. That thing is not better. I will sell it.

2080
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
I'm going to be losing.

2081
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
2000 life I put this on but I'm going to gain a ton of damage.

2082
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Damage always need damage. That's 2000 health I'm going to lose but you know what?

2083
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
It's worth it to do almost a thousand more damage.

2084
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Yeah it's up blue. We'll do it. Yeah we'll do it and temporarily I'm just going to put a

2085
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:35,000
good this gem into it. All right lost a bunch of health so I'm going to be an absolute woose.

2086
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I have pants too maybe you want pants. Pants? I don't need pants. What do I?

2087
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Oh god these way better than what I have. Again I'm going to be losing health.

2088
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Oh well I'm losing health. Who cares?

2089
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
I'll put this in there for now just to have it in there for now.

2090
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:06,000
All right what's that? What's all this? What do you drop in? I want to look.

2091
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I imagine if this is what the elbow 3 was we just stand in place and items fall.

2092
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
What's this? We know what's that. What's this? What's this?

2093
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
This magic in the air. What's this? What's this?

2094
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
All right 20 germapoints do whoever figures out what that song is for up.

2095
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
That's indifference. Remember what you can buy with germapoints.

2096
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:34,000
I don't think anything will be on the button. You can still buy a salad. You can buy a

2097
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:41,000
germapoints salad but 15 germapoints. Don't sell it germapoints give it to me.

2098
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,000
There's probably chocolate chips in the germapoints I don't know if people want it.

2099
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:50,000
You know I can't believe that you don't like chocolate chip pancakes. That's

2100
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:54,000
some that's unbelievable. I've never actually had them just because the color of that is

2101
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:04,000
absolutely disgusting. Oh man oh man.

2102
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Gosh G Gully. Oh I can't I don't have time to look at that but I think it's better.

2103
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
I'm a witch doctor. I am a witch doctor.

2104
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Star is a demon hunter. We're two best friends in the elbow 3.

2105
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I hunt demons except sometimes they help me.

2106
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Makes sense. Makes sense.

2107
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
The bones.

2108
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I carry a bow and confusion mask confusion everyone start fighting each other.

2109
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Oh my god too much.

2110
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
It's a good thing you don't have that health.

2111
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Good thing. I couldn't need it. I could need it. I could use it.

2112
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Oh I got the lead. Watch out. We got an elite.

2113
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,000
And he's got that pole move and he slows you down. That's just fantastic.

2114
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:01,000
He did.

2115
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,000
He has all the things he dropped.

2116
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Yeah those of you that said nightmare before Christmas you are a winner.

2117
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:20,000
You get my right I'm gonna I'm gonna put my hand up the screen right now and it's a high five.

2118
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Oh hey come here.

2119
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Hey punk.

2120
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Come on where you go.

2121
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,000
What's that?

2122
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Wait what do you keep finding these things?

2123
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
I've done the floor.

2124
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
How come I'm not finding these and

2125
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Oh it's way better than what I have thank you.

2126
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,000
That did not just find so many items I don't know what you do.

2127
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
No where are the there it is.

2128
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
23

2129
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
19 47 intellect.

2130
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
It's way better.

2131
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
But it's way yeah critical hit chance though.

2132
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
It's got 2.5% crit on it.

2133
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,000
This does not have it but oh hey what's your amulet?

2134
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I'll inspect you.

2135
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I'll inspect you.

2136
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,000
I'm gonna put this on.

2137
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I'm gonna put a vitality gem in that because I'm under 10k health right now.

2138
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
It's awful.

2139
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Check out this amulet and tell me if you're like interested.

2140
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
And you can just have it anyway.

2141
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,000
All right like seriously you have just replaced like six pieces of my gear.

2142
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Okay.

2143
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
The critical hit damage is this I have a rare on 30 what do you think?

2144
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,000
30% more crit damage or extra health and a little bit more damage.

2145
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
How much are you critting with mask and fusion?

2146
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
10 million.

2147
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,000
I think I'm gonna leave it on because I do pretty big crits with poison dart.

2148
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
It's a treasure Google.

2149
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
What I recommend getting D3 compared to D2.

2150
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I probably not.

2151
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,000
There is this really good game called D2 then.

2152
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
This is treasure goblin.

2153
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Where is he?

2154
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Why is he holding his money over here?

2155
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Why was that money right there?

2156
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Where's this goblin?

2157
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
That was the goblin.

2158
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
I got it.

2159
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
You got it.

2160
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Diablo 2 is one of my favorite games ever made.

2161
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
So I'm very very biased when it comes to comparing Diablo 2 and Diablo 3.

2162
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
But Diablo 2, I mean this game is awesome.

2163
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,000
I'm playing it right now.

2164
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I've dumped a ton of time into it.

2165
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,000
But if you wear a huge fan of Diablo 2 then it's,

2166
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
if you saw I did a review on this game already.

2167
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:43,000
It's on the channel but it's kind of a letdown in the item department.

2168
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:48,000
At least as of right now they're gonna, apparently they're gonna maybe potentially look at legendaries.

2169
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Because where it stands right now a legendary item can be potentially worse than a blue.

2170
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Which is that stat just shouldn't be happening.

2171
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
But for the most part, I mean if you've never played a Diablo game,

2172
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
this is a perfect time to get into it because this game is just

2173
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
it's a very streamlined, it's very fond, very addicting.

2174
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
I say yes, go buy it if you've never, if you've never played Diablo before and you want to

2175
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
then check it out for sure.

2176
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
It's awesome.

2177
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Star, oh god.

2178
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2179
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Too many bullets.

2180
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Oh no!

2181
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Oh my god, my friend, my god, Gahatchewan.

2182
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
He died?

2183
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
No, he almost did.

2184
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
He grew stabilizers.

2185
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:37,000
You did to have like when you go home with your witch doctor on the wall,

2186
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
you need to put notches on the wall for how high or Gahatchewan grows.

2187
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Well, I want to look at something real quick.

2188
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Give me one second.

2189
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Okay, I'll hide in corner with you.

2190
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
How far behind is this stream?

2191
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Like this stream, like I think this, I think my 720 stream is like seven years behind.

2192
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:54,000
That happens.

2193
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Oh, let me take a look at this.

2194
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Because that's like, so people are still like just answering that night before Christmas.

2195
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
And that was like five minutes ago.

2196
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:10,000
So I want to see, I want to see just how far back it is.

2197
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Somebody said 15 seconds.

2198
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Actually, no, the YouTube comment system is probably just bugged like it always is.

2199
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,000
I probably said that before.

2200
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Yeah.

2201
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Oh, why am I watching an ad?

2202
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Ad.

2203
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Adception right there.

2204
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Ads on top of ads on top of ads.

2205
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
They're advertising an ad.

2206
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Go watch this ad.

2207
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Please go watch this ad on top of this ad on top of this ad.

2208
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Go watch this ad.

2209
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Let me see.

2210
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Let me see.

2211
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Go watch this ad on top of this ad.

2212
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
There's a top of this ad.

2213
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:52,000
You're

2214
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Go watch this ad.

2215
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
My intro to low for this.

2216
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Yeah, I guess if you're behind on 720, then oh my god.

2217
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
What did I die from?

2218
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
If you're behind on 720, then refer.

2219
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
I died.

2220
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Oh.

2221
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Is that my fault?

2222
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
No, it's my fault.

2223
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
If you're behind on 720, refresh the page.

2224
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Because that'll get you back in check.

2225
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Because some people are like five to ten minutes behind.

2226
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Why don't I have ad block on?

2227
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Because I mean, at least for YouTube, I like to support YouTubers.

2228
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Like at least people that run ads on their videos.

2229
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,000
So if like if I have a friend or something that has ads, I usually keep it on.

2230
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Just because I like to be nice to them.

2231
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I don't know.

2232
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Pretty good guy.

2233
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Plus can't ad block block other stuff.

2234
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
It's that kind of not supposed to.

2235
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
I don't think so.

2236
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
What's the not supposed to block?

2237
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
I don't know.

2238
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Like I remember hearing that some it's some places like

2239
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
it might think something is an ad when it's not.

2240
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I don't think I see anything like that.

2241
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Do you have ad block?

2242
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I do.

2243
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
I turn it off sometimes.

2244
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,000
So usually when I watch streams or whatever.

2245
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Yeah.

2246
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
I assume that's what a lot of people do.

2247
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Because I mean, I guess it can get really annoying.

2248
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Like if you're just browsing websites and it's like,

2249
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
oh take over your entire screen with an ad.

2250
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,000
I hate those.

2251
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,000
I could totally explain.

2252
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
I would open like four pages to tell you that.

2253
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
This is an ad.

2254
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Yeah.

2255
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
The worst thing was going to open it.

2256
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I was going to tell you to watch the other page.

2257
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Oh, that.

2258
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I did.

2259
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
For a second, I thought we just beat her.

2260
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
But I was looking at the chat.

2261
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,000
No, no, she's punk.

2262
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
She's done.

2263
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Kill the daughters of pain.

2264
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
The story's in hot.

2265
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Wait, did she really did die?

2266
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Didn't she?

2267
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,000
No, no, that's like her like introduced myself thing, isn't it?

2268
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Oh yeah, this is the one where she doesn't even fight you.

2269
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,000
She just like shows up and is like, hey, and then you shoot her once.

2270
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
And she says no.

2271
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
She just introduces herself.

2272
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Hi, I'm a spider.

2273
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Yeah, somebody said ad blockers can mess up some forms.

2274
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Honestly, for this part, I was flying through

2275
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:20,000
when I was doing with this character and I was thinking myself that

2276
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
you probably were supposed to beat her there.

2277
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
And there was probably supposed to be a different boss later.

2278
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
And they just are like, no.

2279
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Yeah, I've maybe not.

2280
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Well, there's let her let her run away.

2281
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,000
It really feels like that.

2282
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
It feels like that with a lot of stuff in this game.

2283
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
But there are other patch in it.

2284
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,000
There's apparently a big patch they're working on for this game.

2285
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
And I don't they haven't said anything about it, but

2286
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
let's wait and see what it is.

2287
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
I hope it's $15.

2288
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Please let it be $15.

2289
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,000
$2.

2290
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,000
If it was $15, I would literally dump a brick.

2291
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Like a brick would, I would have to run to the bathroom

2292
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,000
because a brick would be coming out.

2293
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,000
I just imagine you're taking a very long drive to a nearby dump

2294
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
taking a brick out of your car and just flopping it somewhere.

2295
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
That is how mad you are.

2296
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Going that far out of your way.

2297
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:16,000
So close now, children of the corn.

2298
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Oh, you destroyed the heart.

2299
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
I'm so mad, but I'll keep haunting you.

2300
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:22,000
It's like my body area.

2301
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Anyone would want to bang his plighter.

2302
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Spider.

2303
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,000
So said nothing.

2304
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Good job confusing those two bugs.

2305
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Hey, I did buy part.

2306
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
It's not like these things are given up.

2307
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
They like died before it even came out.

2308
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
I did my part.

2309
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:02,000
I should have used it right now, but it's not cool down because I'm stupid.

2310
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Oh, yeah, this would be a great time to use it because there's a bunch of blue people.

2311
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Oh, I see a yellow.

2312
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,000
I see yellow.

2313
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
I'm not going to pick it up now because I want to kill stuff first.

2314
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Then the server shut down.

2315
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Oh, that would be terrible if it did.

2316
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,000
I'm already overburdened.

2317
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Really?

2318
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
You were in a Justin town.

2319
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Legs, okay, legs.

2320
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:33,000
These are very good for someone else that is not me.

2321
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I will hold on to them.

2322
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Oh, gotta make a ton run.

2323
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
It's all about that money.

2324
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,000
All about the paper.

2325
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,000
It's all about that.

2326
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Diablo three money.

2327
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Once I get a million gold, I'll be happy.

2328
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
It's slowly getting win fours.

2329
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
I have five hours, 71,000 gold.

2330
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
I'm getting there.

2331
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Take a look at some of this stuff.

2332
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,000
I got a lot of just crappy rays that I just need to sell.

2333
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
It's going to take too long in the auction house.

2334
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,000
I'll save these for later.

2335
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Maybe I will try and sell them.

2336
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Yeah, I think my auction house actually cleared

2337
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,000
and all of the items that were in the completed section are gone.

2338
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,000
All the items that I was selling are gone.

2339
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Weird.

2340
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
That shouldn't do that.

2341
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Yeah, if I shouldn't, but...

2342
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:37,000
I just...

2343
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I got to stash a lot of this stuff.

2344
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:44,000
After we kill Asmodant, I need like a million minutes

2345
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
to like sort through all this stuff that I have.

2346
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I hope people already feel like the most exciting part of this stream.

2347
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,000
German going through his items and figuring out what he's going to sell.

2348
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
I would dictate him.

2349
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Oh.

2350
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Okay, now I got run on my backpack.

2351
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,000
I'm just going to sell these.

2352
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,000
I don't need them.

2353
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Whatever I hold on for now.

2354
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Just because.

2355
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,000
You destroyed the Sin Heart.

2356
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Someone.

2357
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Potions are expensive in this game.

2358
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Yes.

2359
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
I can go.

2360
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Potions are very expensive.

2361
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,000
That's why I got ferrets.

2362
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Ferrets.

2363
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,000
My body's here.

2364
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,000
I'm going to check out that other ruin for Firebats.

2365
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Let me check it out.

2366
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Money, money, money, get it, get it, get the money.

2367
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
All right, let me see the firebats.

2368
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
I'll get it, go, go, go, go, go.

2369
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Rapidly, someone bats a seek out nearby enemies for 280% weapon damage as fire.

2370
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Oh my god, I'll try that right now.

2371
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Oh, there's a lot of damage.

2372
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I would recommend that to anyone who likes damage.

2373
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
I'll stick with BlowDark just because I love BlowDark.

2374
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Let me check this out.

2375
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Let's see.

2376
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Oh, it's okay.

2377
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Cool.

2378
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
It's a lot less group.

2379
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Not really a crowdboob anymore.

2380
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
It's kind of a single target move now.

2381
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,000
I should go to Wimsy Shire.

2382
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I'm not at that stage.

2383
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I'm a noob.

2384
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
I'm not ready for deponies.

2385
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,000
I'm not ready for it yet.

2386
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
What is Holder?

2387
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Hold, Hold, Hold, Holder.

2388
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:53,000
That's that?

2389
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Oh, yeah, oh, dude.

2390
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
I guess I can just kind of stand back and do this.

2391
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
It does a lot of damage.

2392
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Close through mana like crazy though.

2393
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I don't know if I like it.

2394
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
I'll try it for a little while.

2395
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I'm not picking up pages of Jewelcrafting only because I'm...

2396
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
It's not something I point at doing, at least right now.

2397
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Once I have a ton of money...

2398
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Well, even then, you would use tones.

2399
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Yeah, I mean, it's...

2400
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,000
I'm in nightmare right now, so the pages of Jewelcrafting

2401
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
aren't gonna get me really anything.

2402
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Why is my dude dead?

2403
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Run away!

2404
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Go get him bats!

2405
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:42,000
The reason why I didn't stream yesterday is because that was having internet problems.

2406
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:47,000
I couldn't get 720 to go through.

2407
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:51,000
And even 360 was being really, really slow and choppy, so...

2408
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Something was going on with the internet.

2409
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I don't know why, but doing an extra long one tonight, today, this morning.

2410
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra read all about it.

2411
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
You can help me when you feel like it.

2412
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
I felt like it.

2413
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Dan, if you're just joining us, you just kind of jumped in.

2414
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
This is the stars here.

2415
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Hi, these stars.

2416
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
They just do.

2417
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
47, there we go.

2418
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Level it up.

2419
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Ooh, move ruins.

2420
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,000
What on it?

2421
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Spirit walker room, I'm gonna check that out.

2422
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Yep, this will be on the channel later.

2423
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Poe show.

2424
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Poe show.

2425
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:41,000
First show.

2426
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Time is...

2427
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,000
So, almost 20 of 11 am.

2428
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Oh yeah, it tells you the time in Diablo.

2429
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Remember when we were talking about that?

2430
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
It's like, oh, how much time have we lost?

2431
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Oh, there it is.

2432
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,000
In my DX story, it was covered with what actually is on the left now.

2433
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
The Sin Hot.

2434
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Get that waypoint.

2435
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
That's, that's everywhere.

2436
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Give me that money, give me that money.

2437
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Yo, money.

2438
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Good, you should.

2439
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
See, I used it to a good time that time, didn't?

2440
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Are you proud of it?

2441
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Yeah, I am.

2442
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:32,000
There was a lot of reasons to do that.

2443
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
I might have to take off that passive skill,

2444
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
what makes all my mana stuff cost more money.

2445
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
I mean, more mana.

2446
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Oh, it makes all my mana cost more money.

2447
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I mean, it's all my mana cost more mana.

2448
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
For what?

2449
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,000
It's...

2450
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Yeah, it's...

2451
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:53,000
All of your damage is increased by 20%,

2452
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:56,000
but every spell costs 30% more mana.

2453
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
But that's so good, that's so much more damage

2454
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
than I wouldn't be doing.

2455
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Squeaky cheer.

2456
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Wait, wait.

2457
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:15,000
I'll probably be playing Diablo 3.

2458
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I mean, today, you mean today?

2459
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Hmm, it probably after we kill Aspidan,

2460
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
once we get to the last part of this act,

2461
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
I might take a break,

2462
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
but if you met long-term, I'll be playing this game.

2463
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
It's probably very long time.

2464
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,000
I would say if it turns out,

2465
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
after all the patches and all the bug fixes

2466
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
and after the initial launch period then,

2467
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
but all stays well and it's all good.

2468
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:45,000
I'll be playing this game for a very, very, very long time.

2469
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Yeah, okay.

2470
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
You're here in this game, MXL.

2471
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
I really still need to play.

2472
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
MxE, mostly tree elimination talent?

2473
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Yes.

2474
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Did you actually install D2?

2475
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I actually did not.

2476
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
But I could...

2477
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
That'll take two seconds.

2478
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
It's only like a one gig file to be honest.

2479
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Oh, did you download it?

2480
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I think I have downloaded,

2481
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
so it shouldn't take that long to...

2482
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Dude.

2483
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
When you download it and install it,

2484
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
don't open it.

2485
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Oh.

2486
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Do that.

2487
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Okay.

2488
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I think I still have...

2489
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:20,000
I think I downloaded it on this computer a long time ago.

2490
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,000
I think it's just still sitting...

2491
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Like the installation file is just still sitting on the computer somewhere.

2492
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:30,000
I'd like to ask you a very serious question right now.

2493
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Okay.

2494
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,000
What is with the dudes in the background?

2495
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
What is your theory on why you can never see their feet?

2496
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Um...

2497
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:38,000
They're having a party.

2498
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:41,000
And they're the pinatas.

2499
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
These poor guys.

2500
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:47,000
I mean, Asman and would certainly have a much higher chance of winning this whole war.

2501
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
If you've just like...

2502
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Yeah, if you just...

2503
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Yeah, you...

2504
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
I'll watch out for the disco ball.

2505
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Just like one of them.

2506
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
You unchain one of those guys.

2507
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
You will take out an entire city.

2508
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Yeah, I don't know.

2509
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Maybe they...

2510
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
They're not that good at fighting.

2511
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Maybe they...

2512
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
They're not that good at fighting.

2513
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
What do they do?

2514
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Why are they here?

2515
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Well, I mean, look, think of it this way.

2516
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
These guys are probably not that strong at this point.

2517
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,000
They've been kind of chained up with like stuffing their heads.

2518
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Why?

2519
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
I don't think they would be that tough anymore.

2520
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,000
If you release them, they'd probably just fall over and go, aww.

2521
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Hmm...

2522
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Even if they just fell over, that'd be...

2523
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
A pretty big fall.

2524
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
They could fall in the right spot.

2525
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Maybe they could fall around and be like,

2526
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Change my diaper.

2527
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:37,000
You don't want that in her pocket or wherever.

2528
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
You're so close now.

2529
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,000
So close.

2530
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Oh, yeah.

2531
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,000
You destroyed the syn-hot.

2532
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
I can't believe you.

2533
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,000
How dare you.

2534
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Second important question.

2535
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Yeah.

2536
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Why is there no elevator here?

2537
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Yeah, and you know what?

2538
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Follow up important question.

2539
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:01,000
How did Asmadan get down here?

2540
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Like, did he...

2541
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
He didn't come down these stairs.

2542
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
He's too big.

2543
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Was he just like born in the bottom?

2544
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,000
And it just never goes anywhere.

2545
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
He doesn't ever go out.

2546
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I guess.

2547
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Like, oh, I mean, like...

2548
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Here's my house, my big Asmadan house.

2549
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,000
I'm like a 75-foot tall, like 9 million-pollin monster.

2550
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
I mean, walk down my spiral staircase.

2551
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:24,000
When you can like, astral project images over your heads,

2552
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
you can talk shit to people.

2553
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Like, when that's your thing, I don't imagine going out.

2554
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Yeah, I probably just sit there and like call ex-girlfriend.

2555
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:37,000
You have no hope.

2556
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Put the put dive.

2557
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Eat it, bats.

2558
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Eat bats.

2559
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
More bats.

2560
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Stand in the middle.

2561
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

2562
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Yeah, I need a more crowd move.

2563
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:00,000
This is a very single target.

2564
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
It's not sure I'm gonna stick with it.

2565
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Or I'm gonna have to change boys and dark to something else.

2566
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Maybe he uses teleportation.

2567
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
That is a good theory.

2568
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
That is a good theory.

2569
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Maybe.

2570
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I mean, he is the lord of...

2571
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Sin.

2572
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Beer?

2573
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I was saying beer.

2574
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Do you say beer?

2575
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
No, I said beer.

2576
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Azmatan, lord of beer.

2577
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Oh yeah, Azmatan, he owns a micro brewery.

2578
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
A lord of beer.

2579
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:32,000
How dare you, oh god, I'm dead.

2580
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I'm gonna die right now.

2581
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:39,000
How dare you insult the lord of beer?

2582
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Wello in the fear of my delicious hops and yees, sorry.

2583
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
I thought he was fearing.

2584
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
That's why he was always...

2585
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Lord of Sin.

2586
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
He's getting off on that.

2587
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
He is a weird one.

2588
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:03,000
He does live with a spider lady that's hell bent on making us like love her but hate her at the same time.

2589
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Why won't you bang me?

2590
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,000
This is his roommate by the way.

2591
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
That's what you gotta live with.

2592
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,000
I would go crazy.

2593
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,000
That's like his wife or something.

2594
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Maybe he just got drunk one night and woke up down there is what someone said.

2595
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
She just won't leave.

2596
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Where am I?

2597
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
You have just a show to shit face right now?

2598
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Where does this place?

2599
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
I own it now.

2600
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Oh, this is mine.

2601
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Oh, this is mine.

2602
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Yeah, I think he doesn't even know why these giant tall guys are here.

2603
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
He definitely gets a comment of the stream.

2604
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Damn it.

2605
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
I want to take a dump.

2606
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Well, you guys talk louder so I can hear you from the crap.

2607
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Oh my god.

2608
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Oh my goodness.

2609
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Get her.

2610
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Yeah, I can't even stun.

2611
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:07,000
That move only works on actual enemies.

2612
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
It's unfortunate.

2613
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Alright, kill him before the teleport.

2614
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Kill him before the teleport.

2615
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Oh, he's just lying down.

2616
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Die, die, die, die.

2617
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Unless you're like normal and one shot or maybe we're getting it.

2618
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Oh, wow.

2619
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Well, blow up at one of Asmode Dance like four hearts.

2620
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Is he a cow or something?

2621
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Nah.

2622
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:34,000
He must be a cow.

2623
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
No, cow.

2624
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Oh my god.

2625
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Get it, get it.

2626
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Cow's have multiple stomachs, not multiple hearts.

2627
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Oh, is he like a cow?

2628
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
He has like four hearts.

2629
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Dirt.

2630
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Oh, look.

2631
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Oh, come on.

2632
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:50,000
It's starting to make sense.

2633
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
What is it?

2634
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
This is one of those big guys' chests.

2635
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:56,000
It's ripped open and the heart is placed over here.

2636
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,000
What?

2637
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:58,000
What?

2638
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,000
You see?

2639
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,000
That's...

2640
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Why would they do such a thing?

2641
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,000
And then the heart powers...

2642
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Duracell.

2643
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Duracell.

2644
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
I don't get how the heart's power is.

2645
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Well, how come...

2646
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Then look at this guy.

2647
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
How come this guy isn't like...

2648
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Has a sin heart.

2649
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Maybe he's not cool enough.

2650
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Maybe he didn't like...

2651
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,000
I guess they're like harvesting them.

2652
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Okay, seriously?

2653
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,000
One of the hopps.

2654
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Seriously, look at this.

2655
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:24,000
There is no way Asmode Dance can fit down this staircase.

2656
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Look at this.

2657
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
There's no way.

2658
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Look at this.

2659
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Look at the height.

2660
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
I'm pointing at the screen right now, by the way.

2661
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I don't know why.

2662
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
The height of this ceiling.

2663
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Look at this.

2664
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Oh, I'm gonna go in my door.

2665
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Like, he wouldn't even be able to get in here.

2666
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Maybe he just jumps down.

2667
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Like, he isn't used to the stairs.

2668
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
He just run back and he rolls off the edge.

2669
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Somebody asked, how was this early morning?

2670
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,000
I started this stream.

2671
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2672
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I started this stream.

2673
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I've been going for a couple of hours, at least a few hours.

2674
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
It was early morning.

2675
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
And I started.

2676
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I am here.

2677
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:05,000
So after this, I'm probably gonna close the stream out for a little while.

2678
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
I might come back.

2679
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
I'm not sure, though.

2680
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Probably not because I want to get some food.

2681
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
I might go to the gym.

2682
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
But get to the waypoint.

2683
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Where about to kill Asma then?

2684
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,000
This is on nightmare.

2685
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
So it might be a little tough.

2686
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Yeah, okay.

2687
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
He might be super tough.

2688
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Don't build it up.

2689
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Everyone's gonna be very disappointed when he dies.

2690
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Bats, bats, bats, bats, bats.

2691
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
I'm gonna use Masking Fusion already.

2692
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,000
I'll do it.

2693
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I'll use it.

2694
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
I started that.

2695
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
7.30, 8 am, my time.

2696
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
So it's been about three hours.

2697
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Going on like three and a half maybe.

2698
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
I never know until I'm done.

2699
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:52,000
And I look at the file that goes up to YouTube.

2700
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:56,000
But it would probably be about three and a half more.

2701
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I'm gonna use Masking Fusion already.

2702
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,000
I'll do it.

2703
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,000
I'll use it.

2704
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,000
But it would probably be about three and a half four hours to hold down.

2705
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
I would assume.

2706
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Oh god.

2707
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Oh, you live in Hong Kong.

2708
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:13,000
So what is like nighttime or something for you?

2709
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Well, you know, you're behind.

2710
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,000
I don't even know.

2711
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Time zones.

2712
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,000
How you work.

2713
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:28,000
If you didn't get to see the TF2 or you didn't get to see the beginning of the Diablo 3 stuff,

2714
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:31,000
it's all gonna be up in probably a couple of hours.

2715
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
The whole thing will be on YouTube.

2716
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Masking Fusion.

2717
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,000
There we go.

2718
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
All right.

2719
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
I got that through with Charms.

2720
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Kill him.

2721
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:46,000
You're on my team now.

2722
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Oh, okay.

2723
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Oh, I wasn't talking to you.

2724
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Hey, kill him now.

2725
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
I'm not that much of a jerk.

2726
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
All right.

2727
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
It's got a rear.

2728
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Come on.

2729
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Give me a good roll.

2730
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Give me a good roll.

2731
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Ooh.

2732
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,000
No, I'm actually with a gem in there.

2733
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
No, I don't think so.

2734
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Oh, no.

2735
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Do I look good in this?

2736
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Do I need a real bet?

2737
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Does this make me look fat?

2738
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Where's my body?

2739
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
There he is.

2740
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:21,000
He always dies and I never like realize it.

2741
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:27,000
I just made a compilation of the noises I've made in this stream.

2742
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
I just made a video of it.

2743
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:32,000
It would be, but you probably pretty funny.

2744
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I make a whole lot of noiseshot.

2745
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Someone said go star.

2746
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,000
I love you.

2747
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
I'm going.

2748
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,000
I hear we are.

2749
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
This is after this.

2750
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
I'm gonna close out the stream.

2751
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,000
And then I'm going to go star.

2752
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:50,000
I'm going to close out the stream.

2753
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
And we will go from there.

2754
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:55,000
And this will all be uploaded to YouTube.

2755
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
If we don't wipe like five times,

2756
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:00,000
which we will not star is pro.

2757
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I'm just Thailand.

2758
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Well, there is.

2759
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
There's a guy that lives in his like down here and that's if he can't move.

2760
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Wiggles around.

2761
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Wiggles is.

2762
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Oh.

2763
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,000
There he comes.

2764
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Oh, get him.

2765
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Gargantra one.

2766
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:18,000
You know what?

2767
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
I want to get this to that.

2768
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,000
That's.

2769
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:27,000
He's going down very, very easily.

2770
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
What does that bomb move you're doing?

2771
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Oh my god.

2772
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:31,000
It almost got one shot.

2773
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,000
What bomb moves?

2774
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:33,000
It looks like the assassin skill.

2775
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Remember the first assassin skill you really got is D.

2776
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Oh, yeah.

2777
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Fire bombs.

2778
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Yeah.

2779
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:40,000
It's kind of like that.

2780
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I can't even like.

2781
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,000
I really only use it to build hatred.

2782
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I'm going to die.

2783
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,000
I'm dead.

2784
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Oh, you're dead.

2785
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:46,000
I'm dead.

2786
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Cool.

2787
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Stay alive, star.

2788
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,000
I'm okay.

2789
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
I got ferrets.

2790
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Use those ferrets to kill this bass sloppy bass.

2791
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:00,000
They're trying to keep up with me and they're like spasming out so hard.

2792
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
There's no way you're going to be able to come get me by the way.

2793
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:07,000
I'm like in this pool of like this darkness pool you're going to die of even trying to revive me.

2794
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Oh, I got you.

2795
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Trust me.

2796
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,000
I could do it.

2797
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,000
I got to do it just because you said I couldn't.

2798
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Oh.

2799
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2800
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Oh, you did it.

2801
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I love you.

2802
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Oh.

2803
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Is he spawns ads?

2804
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
No, he didn't.

2805
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:19,000
God.

2806
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Man, that's a MMO term.

2807
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Give me a legendary.

2808
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Give me a legendary.

2809
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,000
No, just one.

2810
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Give me a blue.

2811
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Got it.

2812
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Sweet.

2813
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Oh, we got to see the.

2814
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,000
The cutscene.

2815
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Skip.

2816
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Oh, I got it.

2817
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
I got it.

2818
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
I got it.

2819
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,000
I got it.

2820
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:35,000
I got it.

2821
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
I got it.

2822
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,000
I got it.

2823
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
I got it.

2824
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,000
I got it.

2825
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,000
I got it.

2826
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,000
I got it.

2827
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:42,000
I got it.

2828
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:43,000
I got it.

2829
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
No, I wanted to know what happened.

2830
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
All right, here's what happened.

2831
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
So we just killed a big fat guy and he died.

2832
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Yeah.

2833
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,000
And then she slams a rock into his soul.

2834
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
And then they all rock out.

2835
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Oh, I've never been to Hong Kong.

2836
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
It's very far away.

2837
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
I've never been, I've never been,

2838
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,000
I've never been besides Canada.

2839
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
I've never been out of the country.

2840
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:12,000
You know, I was in Pennsylvania once.

2841
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,000
One time.

2842
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:18,000
First, the furthest I've been is probably Wisconsin.

2843
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:21,000
I'm going to soda whichever is further.

2844
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
First I've been is Seattle.

2845
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Seattle, Washington.

2846
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I just said you were in Canada.

2847
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Well, I, I've been to Canada.

2848
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,000
I don't live there.

2849
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Whatever.

2850
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Whatever.

2851
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Well, I met like out of the country.

2852
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
That's like the only, that's like the furthest place out of the country.

2853
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
I've never gone anywhere else.

2854
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
That's a lot of damage.

2855
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
It's too hand-in-dough.

2856
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
I don't want to do this event.

2857
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
I don't want to be a spoiler alert.

2858
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Spoiler alert.

2859
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Spoiler, spoiler, spoiler, spoiler, spoiler, spoiler, spoiler.

2860
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Except here we go.

2861
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Spoiler.

2862
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
I don't know how many times I have to say that.

2863
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Spoiler.

2864
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Okay.

2865
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:08,000
All right.

2866
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
That's going to be the end here guys.

2867
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Oh my god.

2868
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
What good bye.

2869
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Everyone.

2870
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:20,000
I, every time I try to end a YouTube stream, like I like always forget how to do it.

2871
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
So let me like figure this out.

2872
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Yeah, thank you all so much for watching, sticking around.

2873
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
And goodbye to star.

2874
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Say your bies.

2875
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Thank you star for coming along and playing.

2876
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:35,000
I hope you all hate, um, Derma.

2877
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:39,000
I mean pancakes with chips and all.

2878
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Hey chocolate chip pancakes are good.

2879
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Good.

2880
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I'm hoping every comment is about that.

2881
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Just telling you you're wrong.

2882
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
You're wrong.

2883
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
It would make my day.

2884
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Um, event manager.

2885
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Life control.

2886
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:56,000
There it is.

2887
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:57,000
All right, dudes.

2888
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Take it easy, everybody.

2889
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
And take care, everybody.

2890
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Peace, soup.

2891
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:12,000
No, yeah, I'm still figuring out.

2892
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:17,000
This is getting awkward.

2893
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
I'll try to edit.

2894
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I'm going to edit.

2895
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:29,000
I'm going to edit.

2896
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
I'm going to edit.

2897
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:34,000
I'm going to edit.

2898
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:37,000
I'm going to edit.

2899
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:40,000
I'm going to edit.

2900
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
I'm going to edit.

2901
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
I'm going to edit.

2902
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
I'm going to edit.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Wee you.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
An Nintendo Wii U.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hey good uh.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Good evening everybody.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I turn uh I turn 30 in like eight minutes.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's about 30.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want to be I want to be 22 again when I was young and free.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And now whatever.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So we're going to celebrate my 30th birthday prematurely by getting angry at a video game that I'm not good at.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hey.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sounds like a pretty good time to me.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What do you say?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And this time I actually have I put my monitor.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well my other monitor.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's over on like the right here.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So I should be able to see chat a lot better this time.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I moved my setup a little bit.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm uh currently transitioning into the experiment office.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Not quite 100% there.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I need to get a couch delivered here first for this downstairs area.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But whatever.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We're good.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm already on expert.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So I hopefully you guys can't hear this.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Make sure my like web cam's not on not like pointing at me.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay we're good.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's stand up.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is one of the problems I'm having with streaming a console game is it's it's on the screen right now right.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And it's audio is obviously coming through.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't want to pick up that audio.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't have like this.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can't plug headphones into my TV.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I just want to make sure you don't make it down here.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It whatever.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Have a good 60th birthday.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
60th birthday.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Not that old.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Actually I have a couple of levels from a star.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We'll get to those.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I haven't warmed up at all by the way.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And I'm still playing on the brick.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So don't get your hopes up.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I've seen me get past level 3.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And hopefully I've got the audio input delay.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I fixed it hopefully.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't know.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So it's very attractively called coin hole.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Easy enough.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is he going to come down?

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He is.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He comes right back up.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Off to a great start.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh geez.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So I guess I do have to wait.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How long does it?

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No, I got to wait.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Second cycle.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Way from to come up again.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh geez.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Maybe not.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There's only one fly over here.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Apparently.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Alright, let's figure this out.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I got to go now.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, okay, okay.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I got to go right on that first one.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't know.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Maybe I'm screwed here.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Did I just screw myself completely?

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Apparently I did.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Here we do it.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Here we do.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This is the one.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And there we go.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What?

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I might just skip this one.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What the hell is even going on here?

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Do I have to get it to like come over to me?

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Like we're going to aggro range?

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I like that.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That was very confusing.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Gotta get those coins.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's the most boring thing.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Look for hidden blocks.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
People put them everywhere.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Looking good.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I can just run across that.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Am I going to die if I go down here?

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, I am.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm not doing that.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm not going to fool me on that one.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What would have happened if I just died if I went down there?

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah, after I absolutely not get through this expert, I will do levels for you guys.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you got some good ones.

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Are you star?

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't know.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
All right.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You know, to save myself a little bit of time, I probably shouldn't just sprint directly through each level.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
My first or second life, I should really just kind of look and see what happens.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So very obviously I have to jump on these to get across.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Would it be you say game?

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I guess I could do this though.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, I don't.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't have it.

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Maybe I do.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Nope, that doesn't work.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I thought that you could bounce on those things.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, that's not that bad.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I should get to the next one or two times.

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll try this.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Just about bounce enough to the second one and then you're pretty much free.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You can bounce on those things.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You can't not.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I just died doing it.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't troll me, star.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What's going on here?

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Can't I bounce on those things?

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There's no way I can beat this unless I can, right?

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I didn't even try to.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I didn't even say I just freaked out right there.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That was stupid.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I hit this fucking ceiling.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Something else I have to invest in is a wired controller as well.

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This thing in my hands, I sweat a lot.

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm a little sweaty.

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm a bitch.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I get greasy on this brick.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Shit.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, yeah.

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I get it.

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You can spin jump on those.

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You don't have to do like the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater strategy.

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Although I probably should still because I'll mess that up a thousand times.

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can do it to them too then.

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I can't do it to that unfortunately.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Huh.

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I wonder what I'm missing here unless there's something I'm just going to jump.

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There's something I can do about it, right?

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Was there a mushroom over there that I missed somehow?

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me.

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's where that is.

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I did that by accident.

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If I did not just by accidently do that, I would have never ever ever beaten this stage and I would have skipped it.

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I would have had to skip it.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Like how the hell are you supposed to know that's there?

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh my god, this is all no, no, no, no, expert level.

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I have to like carry it at least to the next part.

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's not even an expert.

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't even know where it is.

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't even know how to throw it.

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay, right here.

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm not gonna focus on this too.

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I thought I had that one in the bag.

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is not a bitch shit in my fucking hair and use it as shampoo.

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Where is it?

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Just overshot it.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Get this fucking ceiling again.

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I actually might step on this so I don't have to keep holding down why.

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Because that's what's like throwing me off.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Is having to hold the other button.

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
No, that's such a bad idea.

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm not gonna make it.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because I can have to rush the hell out of this.

171
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Just don't rush it.

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I rushed it immediately.

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I said not to.

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
How would you have ever known that was there?

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Is there no clue that that's like a thing?

176
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I rushed it again.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I might skip this one.

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh fuck.

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Three more attempts and I'm skipping it.

180
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I hate this one just because of what happened in the beginning here.

181
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm already getting upset at this one.

182
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
How do I put this down on the ground?

183
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't want to kick it.

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't want to kick this.

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's gonna get kicked.

186
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yeah, I can.

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh boy, here we go.

188
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Mother fuck.

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That was going fine.

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I just screwed it up at the end.

191
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let me move back a little.

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't even know what happened there.

193
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That would be so bad if I kicked it off.

194
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Easy now.

195
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I wonder if I'll make this easier on myself if I use the Wii U stick sideways rather than the brick.

196
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Is that better?

197
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Fuck.

198
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's that last one.

199
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That last jump always gets me because he ended up hitting the ceiling.

200
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The hole just fucking thing for so long.

201
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Dear lord in heaven.

202
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The Wii Mode sucks too.

203
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How much is one of the regular Nintendo controllers?

204
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Are they like 60 bucks?

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
God.

206
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm trying to see.

207
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Not in doing it.

208
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Never mind.

209
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The classic controller is only 20 bucks.

210
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I should get one.

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It seems like a much better idea.

212
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That last one just gets me every single fucking time.

213
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's funny because I actually said to myself like maybe I should wait till I get like a real controller before I actually play this on stream again.

214
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And what do you know?

215
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I turn the fucking stream on without a pro controller.

216
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We're getting locked into this one.

217
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I might skip it.

218
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I might do skip strats.

219
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Oh dear god.

220
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You know what? Hold on a second.

221
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I think I have an idea.

222
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No I don't.

223
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't have an idea.

224
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I see the weight.

225
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Hey look I made it.

226
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Shit.

227
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Shit.

228
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
If I step on this.

229
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh my god I just did it.

230
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I didn't even understand what was happening.

231
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't know why I just activated.

232
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh boy.

233
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Those patterns seem to be off half the time for me.

234
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Alright we're gonna do this one more time and I'm skipping it because I'm not gonna have another stream where I sit on the same level for like 40 minutes.

235
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
After this one that was level 69.

236
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I can't end on that one.

237
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Come here at you.

238
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh I was gonna hit silky.

239
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh there's an actual shortcut on this level.

240
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Where is it?

241
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If I just hit this we'll just show to me now.

242
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Why have I not been doing that?

243
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Holy shit.

244
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Why the hell have I been not doing that?

245
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm just gonna do that.

246
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That sounds, it looks like much easier.

247
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Just jump the whole thing.

248
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh what?

249
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's not fair.

250
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll try this with this strategy a couple more times.

251
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:13,000
No I hit it too high.

252
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Come on.

253
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No that was a bad idea.

254
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Nevermind that's a terrible idea.

255
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Alright this is really the last attempt before I skip.

256
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Okay, try to always skip.

257
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Get me out of this fucking level.

258
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Bye.

259
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We're gonna play a different one.

260
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Look at this level.

261
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
This level is much better.

262
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Look at those in mushrooms.

263
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Where's the inner here?

264
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh shit.

265
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Damn it.

266
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The next one was the ticket.

267
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
No way.

268
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I never would have beaten that one.

269
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It was just too awkward.

270
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh boy, I was like talking.

271
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Those guys are going to be aware of it.

272
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm gonna hit by those spikes.

273
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We'll let you go by.

274
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I think he will.

275
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What's his pattern?

276
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah, there he goes.

277
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh I start off float.

278
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy, easy.

279
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Get in the fucking boat.

280
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I screwed it up already.

281
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Maybe not though.

282
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Just to go through this with fast enough.

283
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Keep them behind the wall.

284
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
They will not be able to hit you.

285
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Boy, this is actually gonna be very difficult.

286
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Is it possible for me to still do it without the cloud?

287
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Shit.

288
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, that was a mistake.

289
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I was not able to get by fast.

290
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That was toast already.

291
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Slow this one down.

292
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I don't need to go that fast.

293
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
That guy will hit you every single time.

294
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm gonna go for like that.

295
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Some reason he still hit me.

296
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Shit, I hit him.

297
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:46,000
All right, so how long till I rage quit this game and go play like fucking checkers?

298
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
When am I gonna start like live stream and be like eating snacks?

299
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, my god, that's just like not paying any attention anymore.

300
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Still doable.

301
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I just rush things way too much.

302
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Maybe a little while.

303
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There are like secrets up here.

304
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I guess not.

305
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

306
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Secret.

307
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
That was a mushroom.

308
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
A mushroom just came out of that guy.

309
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What did they come out?

310
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
No, they came out of the, okay, okay.

311
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm gonna stop being such a fucking dumbass and like using these lives instantly.

312
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Both of them.

313
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Slow the fuck down.

314
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
How am I supposed to know how I was gonna avoid that?

315
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Wait for this guy to come up.

316
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Okay, geez.

317
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh my god.

318
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm just gonna die.

319
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I was gonna jump into the fucking lava.

320
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Probably, I probably still would get angry playing checkers.

321
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I don't know when the last time I played checkers was.

322
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Whoa.

323
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
There was a mushroom in here though.

324
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Where was that mushroom?

325
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
How did I get it?

326
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It was like, I went up here.

327
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Drops down and out.

328
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Okay, I say, I say, I say.

329
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You might not be a bad time to go.

330
00:23:44,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Too many things on the screen.

331
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I wonder.

332
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Waiting is bad.

333
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's always bad for me to wait here.

334
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Because another one's just gonna come from the other side, right?

335
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Kind of, I guess.

336
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Oh, not really.

337
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Okay.

338
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I have three hits now.

339
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Maybe even four.

340
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm gonna get the power right through it.

341
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh shit.

342
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
They follow through the...

343
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I just realized that they come through.

344
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I thought I could just power right through that.

345
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
But I forgot that they can like move through the thing and clip through everything.

346
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
That's gonna be a lot harder than I thought it was gonna be initially.

347
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So I can't just blow right through and just damage boost it.

348
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I just need to wait.

349
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
That's gonna be fun.

350
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Is he gone?

351
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
No, he's gone.

352
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I ran right into his fucking little bridge.

353
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I just grabbed the wall.

354
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Hey, remember what I said last time I played this?

355
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Grabbing the fucking walls in this game.

356
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I wish they deleted it.

357
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I wish I could like hold like L and R to like grab a wall.

358
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I hate auto grabbing walls in games.

359
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It drives me fucking crazy.

360
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:50,000
All right.

361
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
What the fuck is happening?

362
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
What the fuck is happening?

363
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Why didn't he not go in it?

364
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay, I need to get them on the both the same side.

365
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
They're in such a terrible spot.

366
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
They need to be, they need to both be on the same side.

367
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Otherwise it's impossible for me to go through this.

368
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Come over here.

369
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,000
There we go.

370
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm trying to figure out what the opportunity is to go.

371
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
All right, so it's this.

372
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Over here.

373
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Not really.

374
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So what determines if they're gonna follow you and not?

375
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Like, it sprint like that fast across the screen.

376
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Like that.

377
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I just gotta go down, up, up.

378
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So they bounce back, bounce back, bounce back.

379
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It's shit.

380
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It needs a shell.

381
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Hey guys, it beat a level.

382
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Can you believe it?

383
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I know it took me like 55 lives to beat a level.

384
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm just gonna jump.

385
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I have to do that right.

386
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I have to immediately get rid of Yoshi.

387
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Sorry, Yoshi.

388
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Sorry.

389
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
That's me.

390
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Holy crap.

391
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What the hell's going on here?

392
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I just freaked out for a second.

393
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That's all these spiky guys.

394
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I gotta ditch you again, Yoshi.

395
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm sorry.

396
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah.

397
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Okay, go in there.

398
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Shit.

399
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
That was the follow-up to that one.

400
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
That was the follow-up to that one.

401
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I can spawn them again.

402
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I don't think it matters.

403
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Can I get back there at the question?

404
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I think I've lost it.

405
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Fuck.

406
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
These are serious.

407
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
What the hell was that?

408
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Is that what I have to do?

409
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I guess that's what I have to do.

410
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Oh.

411
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm on the left.

412
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I like this level.

413
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So you've got to go one, two, three.

414
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I can probably skip it right if I go now.

415
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I can't get back there.

416
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I can't get back there.

417
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Shit.

418
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
No, not really.

419
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Shit.

420
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
What's the correct way to do that?

421
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Go off the first one.

422
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I assume it's just go off the first one.

423
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Right?

424
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'll figure that out in a second.

425
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It must be a leap of faith off that first one.

426
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
He goes the highest.

427
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Spin jump.

428
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Maybe.

429
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm going to assume it's one, two, one, these ones.

430
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Let's do it.

431
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm not out of the key even.

432
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That last one doesn't go high enough.

433
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I don't think.

434
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm going to assume it's going to be another one.

435
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You have to make a staircase at this point.

436
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Maybe that is what you had to do.

437
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
That was just kind of there as a screw.

438
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You had to go fast through this one.

439
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Nice.

440
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
There we go.

441
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Skip.

442
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Don't need to skip that one.

443
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Some of these, man, some of these with the hidden blocks that you have to just find.

444
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Those make me very angry.

445
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And I get pissed off and I start to grab and squeeze on my controller and use it as a frying pan.

446
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Because look at this thing.

447
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It's as big as a fucking frying pan.

448
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I don't know if I believe this.

449
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Probably some type of hidden thing.

450
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Whatever.

451
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Oh shit.

452
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Gigantic goons.

453
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Haha.

454
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You can't go through it back.

455
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Can they go walk through those?

456
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yes, they can.

457
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Of course.

458
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Why wouldn't they be able to do that?

459
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Well, shoot the big shell.

460
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I knew it.

461
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I knew it.

462
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I knew it.

463
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I need that.

464
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I need this.

465
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I need to carry one of the smaller ones through.

466
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Why is there a coin there?

467
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Is the point of the coin being there?

468
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I don't want any of these little shits ruining this.

469
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Can I not grab them?

470
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You can't pick them up, can you?

471
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
How do you get over that?

472
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I don't know.

473
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I think I understand.

474
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yep.

475
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
What is below this?

476
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Please don't just y'all.

477
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Oh shit, a look at you.

478
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Oh my god.

479
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh my god.

480
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh my god.

481
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Oh my god.

482
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I wasn't going fast enough.

483
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
This one's doable.

484
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Very, very much so.

485
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
No.

486
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Now wait till the firsts or second shot.

487
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I wasn't going to be running with it.

488
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
That's something I was doing that first time.

489
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:59,000
You just got to go right over him.

490
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh, fucking eat my ass.

491
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Thank you.

492
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I get rid of these turtles.

493
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Okay, let him come back.

494
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
No, that's not it.

495
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
This seems actually pretty difficult.

496
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
He needs to be on the way back.

497
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
That's for sure.

498
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That was it.

499
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm going to do wrong there.

500
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Please do our kids are watching.

501
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:01,000
At this late at night, I'm not sure about that.

502
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
You know, be really easy if I could just get it on the first run.

503
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I have to get it on the first run otherwise I'll never get it.

504
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I could do the mid air spin too, but twirl around.

505
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I always forget you can do that in this game.

506
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That thing.

507
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
They're awkward spot from my finger though.

508
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's like up on the top.

509
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Because the Wii U gamepad, it's like that's so far above where my thumbs are.

510
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So hitting the right trigger is like extremely awkward playing this game.

511
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I can't wait until I don't have to ever use this thing again though.

512
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Holy shit, this thing sucks.

513
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:09,000
There it is.

514
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
He just keeps throwing him.

515
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
What the fuck?

516
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Wait a second.

517
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Where did I go?

518
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I got to kill him.

519
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I got to jump on his head.

520
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I thought there was going to be a little ledge I could go over on the right.

521
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Okay, I got to jump over him, hit him and take his spot.

522
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:37,000
That's going to be kind of a pain in the ass.

523
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Shit, this too close.

524
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
There we go.

525
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Let's move.

526
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I want instantly died by something.

527
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Nothing over here, right?

528
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Oh, he can just jump up.

529
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
What the fuck?

530
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Come on.

531
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I didn't even have a time to react.

532
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
There's no reaction time.

533
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
They just threw me in a room with a ball.

534
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Whoops, run.

535
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It's just bouncing around and shit.

536
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Come on.

537
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
That was so stupid.

538
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
That was not fair.

539
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I love how expert levels.

540
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You take the word expert and actually you can just put in a different word.

541
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
It's called random unfair shit.

542
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Are you out?

543
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
No, no, no, no.

544
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
When you go in this room, you're fucking guaranteed to die at least once.

545
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Now I'm mad and I'm just walking to stuff.

546
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
The stream lagged for me so it looks like you just walked in and died.

547
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
That is exactly what happened.

548
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I walked in and died.

549
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm going to get some of the passion back into this because I'm just walking into stuff and dying.

550
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:33,000
That's going to come back at me.

551
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm going to be careful here.

552
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Hello.

553
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
What?

554
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Are you kidding me?

555
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Please just walk through this.

556
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Hurry up. You're so damn slow.

557
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:09,000
That was doomed.

558
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
That was doomed from start.

559
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:22,000
That would, they didn't want me to win that one.

560
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
That's such dog shit.

561
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
That was perfect.

562
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You can't do it on that first time.

563
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You have to wait till it goes by.

564
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You have to wait until it goes by one time.

565
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Otherwise that's just going to happen to you every single...

566
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
...fucking time.

567
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Every single time.

568
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
That's going to happen to you every time.

569
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Jump the first one and do it on the second one.

570
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I didn't do it.

571
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I didn't do it.

572
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Mom, I didn't do it.

573
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
No, I didn't do it again, mom.

574
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Come back.

575
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
We'll try to get him, mom.

576
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
There we go.

577
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I did it, mom.

578
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Okay.

579
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Just, what do I do here?

580
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I don't know.

581
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I've no idea.

582
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
That j- I'd...

583
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Lucky, didn't even do it.

584
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I've no idea what just happened.

585
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Holy shit.

586
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Holy shit.

587
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Holy shit.

588
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Is this a... is this a completeable one?

589
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm going to lose it.

590
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I don't think I got it.

591
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Oh, there it is.

592
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
This is my completeable mom.

593
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I love the guy in chat that just said,

594
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
What is he trying to talk to his mom?

595
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
A fucking fireball.

596
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's so stupid.

597
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I think I might skip this one too.

598
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
We'll see.

599
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
If I get there again,

600
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I don't just...

601
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I just don't know what to do there.

602
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
There's a big skeleton blocking the road.

603
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay, this one I had to...

604
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I just jumped.

605
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah, you just got to jump immediately.

606
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Here we go again.

607
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Do I just slide down the left and just not even care?

608
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
What?

609
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
What do I... what do I do?

610
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Does anybody have any strategy for this?

611
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Obviously, I have to hit that guy on the head from above on the ceiling.

612
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So if I hit the...

613
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But then I have the ghost that's just sitting there that whole time.

614
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
But I have to pull that ghost away.

615
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
That's gonna be...

616
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
That's gonna be very, very difficult.

617
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And I don't think my brain is capable of completing that.

618
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
We'll find out very shortly.

619
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Oh, you son of a bitch.

620
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
You didn't even fucking do it that time.

621
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You only get hit dry bones once.

622
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It might be doable.

623
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
If that's the last area, but that's the last screen, then I might be able to do it.

624
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
But I don't know.

625
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Probably not.

626
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Don't get your hopes up.

627
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Oh, this one.

628
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I have no idea.

629
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Seriously.

630
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Seriously, I think...

631
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So I've done that room five times now.

632
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I've done the exact same thing all five times.

633
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And half the time I land on his head.

634
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So I guess I'm just gonna roll the dice in that room.

635
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I guess.

636
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Oh, what the fuck was with that little dinghy fireball sitting there still?

637
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
You little dinghy fireballs.

638
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That was close.

639
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I'm just gonna do it.

640
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You didn't come in that time.

641
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You didn't even come in.

642
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I'm skipping it.

643
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
We're out of here.

644
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Hit the skip.

645
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Where's the skip button?

646
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Give it to me.

647
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Get me out of there.

648
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
See ya.

649
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I ain't doing that shit anymore.

650
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I look like this one.

651
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
There's a shoe in this level.

652
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Oh, I get to be Link.

653
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Oh, shit.

654
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Whoops.

655
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm trying to figure out like...

656
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Is the one cavity moves?

657
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Or did you get...

658
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm just trying to figure out what he does.

659
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Fuck is happening right now.

660
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
What just...

661
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I don't have any idea what I did.

662
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I must have just done something correct.

663
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
No, I did.

664
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I don't know.

665
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I should have gone there, right?

666
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I guess.

667
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I guess we're still okay.

668
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Oh, he shits.

669
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I don't even know.

670
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Fuck.

671
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm not gonna do that.

672
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm not gonna do that.

673
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I'm not gonna do that.

674
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm not gonna do that.

675
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I'm not gonna do that.

676
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I'm not gonna do that.

677
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm not gonna do that.

678
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Fuck is this game, man.

679
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Oh.

680
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I can't play the game right now.

681
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm sorry.

682
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I was gonna run.

683
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm supposed to beat this.

684
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And there's a change-up coming up.

685
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:23,000
This is what I'm gonna do.

686
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Fuck is it?

687
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Fuck is it?

688
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Fuck is it?

689
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Fuck is it?

690
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Fuck is it?

691
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Fuck is it?

692
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Fuck is it?

693
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Fuck is it?

694
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
God.

695
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I need to just stand still.

696
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I just stand still.

697
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I'm not gonna get the stand still.

698
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Are you serious?

699
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I'm gonna get the instant die.

700
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Well, I guess I could kill that thing now that I know that.

701
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So I just can't move.

702
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Alright, I'm not going to move.

703
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I'm going to stand up on the last one and I'm not going to move.

704
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I hope that's correct.

705
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Okay, I thought there was a thing there.

706
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
It's working.

707
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It's working.

708
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
There's so many things chasing me right now.

709
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I hope this is the correct strategy.

710
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I thought I was unaware.

711
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I thought maybe I was supposed to kill one of them and take one of these ships.

712
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I did not know what to do there.

713
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Do I want the fireflower?

714
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I don't know.

715
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I don't want to boot anymore.

716
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
It's making me move too weirdly.

717
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I think I'm just going to jump out of it.

718
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Wait a minute.

719
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
That thing's supposed to hit the...

720
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
It was killing the other ones, wasn't it?

721
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
They're at the same family.

722
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
There is a pipe here.

723
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So yeah.

724
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I don't know if I'm going to get the right way or not.

725
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Good luck.

726
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Thanks.

727
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I appreciate it.

728
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
How do I get over there?

729
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
On the pipe down here?

730
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
What is all this shit?

731
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Should I just fly up and go down the pipe?

732
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
That on my way.

733
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Follow me down. Can I take this in the pipe?

734
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Holy shit.

735
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
That was insane.

736
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I almost just died.

737
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I don't know.

738
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Kill this guy.

739
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
One more time.

740
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
See you later.

741
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Did I win?

742
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Another pipe.

743
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I'm protected.

744
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I have a lot of protection right now.

745
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I'm not that scared.

746
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It's not very long.

747
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I could have gone that one.

748
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Holy shit in my pants.

749
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
What the hell?

750
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Should I go in there and go down?

751
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I wonder if I should go down there.

752
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Nope.

753
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Doesn't do anything.

754
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Oh, just shooting coins.

755
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Okay, that's funny.

756
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That's funny.

757
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I like this level now because that guy put that there and it shoots out coins.

758
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Holy goodness.

759
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
A lot of trolls in this level.

760
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Looks like a knock this guy down there, right?

761
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Holy get him.

762
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yes, he will.

763
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Not all of them.

764
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Well, that's what I get for standing still.

765
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I didn't realize there was fire underneath me.

766
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I get.

767
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Okay.

768
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
What the hell?

769
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Where am I going?

770
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
What the hell's going on?

771
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I'm dead.

772
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
That was weird.

773
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
You just put a bunch of random shit all over the pole.

774
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Airship.

775
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Hard.

776
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Okay, last time I did expert.

777
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I got to, well, I got to level five and it was over.

778
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I couldn't beat it.

779
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I got to level five and it was over.

780
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I couldn't beat it.

781
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I got to level five and it was over.

782
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I knew it.

783
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Is this a scroller?

784
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
No.

785
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Not really.

786
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I guess kind of goes up.

787
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I should have nothing I'm missing, I guess, up here or whatever.

788
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:36,000
speak

789
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:50,000
the

790
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
ship they will center

791
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Why would this be here if they wasn't a reason for it?

792
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Yeah, okay.

793
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Shit.

794
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
What the fuck?

795
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Geez.

796
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I thought it was going to keep going.

797
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
That's a pretty big skip.

798
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I can remember that for next time if I don't beat it.

799
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Tap fast again.

800
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Come on.

801
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Get over here.

802
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Oh.

803
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I kind of screwed over here, but yeah, I shouldn't be standing over there.

804
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
That's a mistake.

805
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Set it.

806
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Yes.

807
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
The hitbox on that was a second away from heading.

808
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I just don't know.

809
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
That's the worst part about these levels is you just don't know.

810
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I just don't know.

811
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Thank God.

812
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Thank God that wasn't something stupid at the end.

813
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Those moles are the worst enemy in any Mario game.

814
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Yeah, they throw those wrenches that just go very, very slow and they're very, very annoying.

815
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,000
That was a good one.

816
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
That was fun.

817
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Although I kind of just skipped everything.

818
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Okay, well, that's what I get for reading over here.

819
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I'm looking over the chat and the saw blade just spins me right in the spine.

820
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Come on now.

821
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Get away from me.

822
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
You serious?

823
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I like this one.

824
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
This one's awesome.

825
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:27,000
This one is really, really great because it's just like good luck.

826
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Okay, I'm definitely going to vote this one up.

827
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
This one was amazing.

828
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Like what a dick.

829
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
This is great.

830
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
This is the best level.

831
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I don't even care if I die 50 times on this level.

832
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
It's worth it.

833
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
This one's awesome.

834
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Please.

835
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I should just run underneath them.

836
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I probably just keep running.

837
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
No, not on that one.

838
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
After this first one though.

839
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I don't.

840
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
One of these things.

841
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I can like, oh, what?

842
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I have to climb them.

843
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
You.

844
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Actually, that bad.

845
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I thought it was going to climb the whole thing.

846
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,000
What?

847
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Do I reach out?

848
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I wonder.

849
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yeah, I do.

850
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
This German reach out.

851
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I'm on to how responsive he is.

852
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Responsive enough to take two deaths because I'm over here reading.

853
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
The whole goal with this one.

854
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
This is, no, it's already done.

855
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Just get me.

856
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
You have to get so far ahead on this first run right here.

857
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I got to go so fast.

858
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I got to get by.

859
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I got to have a lot of time.

860
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
A lot of leeway.

861
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Like here, I got to get a lot of good time on this one.

862
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Last jump too.

863
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:37,000
This is going to be so hard.

864
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Creatively he made it so you really just can't run.

865
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
You have to jump from time to time.

866
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Even if you want to try to do like, I'm not going to do it.

867
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I'm going to sprint technique.

868
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I don't want to pick it up.

869
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Okay, I've got a lot of time here.

870
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Oh god.

871
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I did it.

872
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
If I answer with high, you'll become a nun.

873
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Well, time for you to become a nun.

874
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I don't have very many lives left.

875
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Well, this is a scroller.

876
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Auto scroller.

877
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
No time to touch anything.

878
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
That was a power button.

879
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
This is very, very messy.

880
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
This is a mess.

881
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
There's a lot of mess going on.

882
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
What a mess.

883
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I just got off top.

884
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
What the fuck is Bob doing over here?

885
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,000
What the hell is happening?

886
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
What's happening?

887
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Am I just going to skip this one?

888
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:37,000
The only thing I can think of is just, nope, you can't wait it out.

889
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Did I not die?

890
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I was still alive.

891
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I was still alive for like five straight seconds when I fell.

892
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Where was I?

893
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I am extremely confused by that.

894
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I can jump up.

895
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I can go on top of that and jump on top.

896
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:04,000
That's what I'm going to do.

897
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Ready?

898
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
This is the strategy right here.

899
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Got it.

900
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I was trying to fly.

901
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I was trying to fly.

902
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Am I going to die?

903
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:35,000
No, good lord.

904
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I had that one too.

905
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
No, this is not going to happen.

906
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Can't jump on his head.

907
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Give me the pow.

908
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,000
It's just so much shit happening at the same time.

909
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Maybe it's better to go up the left.

910
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I love that this one's called epic battle.

911
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Oh, thank God.

912
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Give me the mushroom.

913
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Great.

914
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
It's no, I fucked it up.

915
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,000
There's no way I'm going to be this way.

916
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Shit, there's a guy with fucking everywhere.

917
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:54,000
This flames and shit too come on.

918
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Hi.

919
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:16,000
This one would be easy if the very beginning you didn't get hit by everything in the game.

920
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Look at all this shit that they throw up on you.

921
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I have to sit here.

922
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I'm trying to jump on his head.

923
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Get the fuck out of my goddamn way.

924
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Getting locked in the corner.

925
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Anybody remember where the bridge is?

926
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Not there.

927
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Not there. The bridge wasn't there.

928
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I couldn't even see it.

929
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I don't know where it was.

930
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:07,000
God.

931
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:14,000
How annoying is this?

932
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I love that I have to have just a fish come out at you too.

933
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Nope.

934
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Oh, I got stuck.

935
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I was trying to do a re-attack to get it to work.

936
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,000
This is so fucking stupid.

937
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I wish I could make that jump.

938
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I just did, but I'm not gonna help.

939
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Get away from me, everybody, please.

940
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Alright, let's do it.

941
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I'm not gonna...

942
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Please.

943
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Don't even tell me I was about to lose that.

944
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Epic battle.

945
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:58,000
This one's called my best level.

946
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Got a wall of coupas to start.

947
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I'm liking the wall of coupas.

948
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I feel like I should get up there faster.

949
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I'm just waiting for it.

950
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
What the hell is even here?

951
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I don't know.

952
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:41,000
What on earth is going on here?

953
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Is there a shell I can grab?

954
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I guess I just have to take the damage and keep moving.

955
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Apparently.

956
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I don't know why that hit me.

957
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I'm just flying things.

958
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Musical notes.

959
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Stuff that falls.

960
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I'm just going to get that out of here.

961
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I'm gonna pick it up and start out on my way.

962
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Well, we all have to assume that this is what has to happen.

963
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Why would I ever go in there?

964
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Why would you ever go in there?

965
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Yeah, I missed it or something.

966
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Apparently, I guess that was just went too far, apparently.

967
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:07,000
There's just a bunch of random platforms with enemies surrounding them all.

968
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:20,000
That shouldn't be too difficult to get back there.

969
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Apparently, it is though.

970
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I don't even know if I want to play this one again.

971
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I'm way above the sky box right now.

972
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I couldn't hit them.

973
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Would that come on?

974
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I'm gonna pick this up.

975
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Really, really now.

976
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Apparently, it wasn't high enough.

977
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I'm just gonna get another one of those.

978
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I was trying to place that, but I don't need to.

979
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Maybe I should just break this, but if I might be in a lot of trouble.

980
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Maybe I just shouldn't go as high as I did before.

981
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I mean, what if there is something in here?

982
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It might be.

983
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I really appreciate if you stopped moving.

984
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:13,000
This fireball coming right at me.

985
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Oh, I saw a chat told me that it was the equipment that could have been a secret door.

986
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Can you even have secret doors in this game?

987
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Did I just die for no reason?

988
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I actually just forgot that that was right here.

989
01:10:47,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Well, this doesn't even matter. I can just walk right through it.

990
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I'll tell you right now, I don't like being able to clip right through those fucking doors.

991
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Those blocks.

992
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Are you gonna just walk through them?

993
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And it seriously gives me like a freak out for a second.

994
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Okay.

995
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
What the hell is that thing?

996
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Looks like I'm picking up.

997
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I'm not messing around with that.

998
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I can't do it.

999
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Take up the spindle.

1000
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Help.

1001
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I'm coming.

1002
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I don't know if I'll get there in a pretty sense, but I'm definitely coming.

1003
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Oh, no.

1004
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Thank you.

1005
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Thank you for the instant, instant, instantaneous death.

1006
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:37,000
That's very nice of you.

1007
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Slipper-y-ass blocks.

1008
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I need to just go then.

1009
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
This way might be harder than the other way.

1010
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Don't look at that door.

1011
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:00,000
How do I get in there?

1012
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Is that like- is that an accident?

1013
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I feel like that person did not me to put that there.

1014
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Maybe they did.

1015
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I have no idea.

1016
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Trying to figure it out.

1017
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Oh my fucking god.

1018
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Yeah, that does not look like an entrance.

1019
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
It looks like you go in it.

1020
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Or there's an invisible block.

1021
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
You gotta do it.

1022
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Shoot the stupid thing.

1023
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Now I'm paranoid.

1024
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Every time it's just not in the right spot for me to jump.

1025
01:13:49,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Can you please be in the right spot for me to jump over to it?

1026
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I should probably go in here.

1027
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I don't know.

1028
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I went in the third one.

1029
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Okay, third one's death.

1030
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Third one is- Third one is you just die.

1031
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
That's good to know.

1032
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I'm just going to go in this one then.

1033
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Maybe this will just bring me-

1034
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Okay.

1035
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
You got it?

1036
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:39,000
We get two more lives.

1037
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Cool.

1038
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
So that's what that does.

1039
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I was hoping maybe there'd be something else to do.

1040
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
There's like a safer or something.

1041
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Whatever.

1042
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Is this the first one?

1043
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Huh.

1044
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
So.

1045
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I guess you do-

1046
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
You do want to go in the second one then?

1047
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
You have to go through this-

1048
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
The whole thing.

1049
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Because I only have like one second to go here.

1050
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Wouldn't it wear those two jump-up?

1051
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Right there.

1052
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Am I going to shit by this if I walk?

1053
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I'm scared to walk.

1054
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Whatever.

1055
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Moment of truth.

1056
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Moment of truth.

1057
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
That one comes up there.

1058
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I'm so-

1059
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Oh my fucking god.

1060
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I just went too high.

1061
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,000
I pressed the button too hard.

1062
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
It happens.

1063
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Sometimes you just press the button and you just jump across the whole map.

1064
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Number two.

1065
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Just for the shits.

1066
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Okay.

1067
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Number two seems to be the one that you want to use.

1068
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Boy.

1069
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I think it's-

1070
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I think it's over though.

1071
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Is there anything else I can do about this?

1072
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Yeah.

1073
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I-

1074
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
No, I just had to go faster apparently.

1075
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Well, there it is.

1076
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
That's it.

1077
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I don't know any more lives.

1078
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Oh well.

1079
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I got to level eight.

1080
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Let's give one more go.

1081
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:05,000
One more attempt.

1082
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Mario memorization should be how this game gets renamed.

1083
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Because you have to memorize every level.

1084
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:27,000
They give you 100 lives so you can spend 20 of them memorizing the level.

1085
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Oh, this is-

1086
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
You have to be small to get through here.

1087
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
That was-

1088
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
That was Mario memorization.

1089
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Guaranteed to die.

1090
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:52,000
So I'm assuming you I shouldn't touch any of these.

1091
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:02,000
What?

1092
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Just run, right?

1093
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Do I have enough speed?

1094
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Yeah, I do.

1095
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
More mushrooms.

1096
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
If you touch a mushroom, you just-

1097
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
You fail.

1098
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Oh shit.

1099
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Where did they come up?

1100
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:28,000
It's 1, 2, 3, 4.

1101
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Okay, I've got time there.

1102
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Where's that at?

1103
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
That might be it.

1104
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Ooh, does this want me?

1105
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
To get one of these and jump in damage boost up, I think it does.

1106
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I can't see how the-

1107
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I have another reason why.

1108
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
No, no, it didn't want me to do that at all.

1109
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I thought that's what it wanted me to do.

1110
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Shit.

1111
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
One of these can see-

1112
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
One of these can fly up and touch me.

1113
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Nope.

1114
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Okay, well, this one's cool.

1115
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I like this one.

1116
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,000
This one's interesting.

1117
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Shit.

1118
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
This is dumb.

1119
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I forgot about that one.

1120
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
No, this course isn't too hard.

1121
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I love how-

1122
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Thanks for doing that, by the way, Nintendo.

1123
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Thanks for doing that.

1124
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Thanks for popping that screen up and making me have to hit A and then instantly lose the level.

1125
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Appreciate it.

1126
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Appreciate it.

1127
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I really like that.

1128
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I tried the jump, but I tried.

1129
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:22,000
It just didn't work.

1130
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
The dreaded sometimes you press jump and it just don't work some.

1131
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:33,000
It just doesn't work.

1132
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It's dreaded.

1133
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:49,000
When I look down here, I'm curious as to why that isn't Arrow coming up here.

1134
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Maybe?

1135
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
No.

1136
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I don't think that would work that way.

1137
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I don't know.

1138
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I guess I could go this way.

1139
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Maybe?

1140
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:13,000
That will-

1141
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
What's that?

1142
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
What's that?

1143
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:22,000
What's that?

1144
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
What's that?

1145
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
What's going on with my character right now?

1146
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Why am I like drunk?

1147
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I don't like this.

1148
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I don't like this at all.

1149
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Okay, it's in temporary.

1150
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Waiting.

1151
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Oh, okay.

1152
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
There you go.

1153
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Sure.

1154
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Patterns.

1155
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I thought he was going up.

1156
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Fuck.

1157
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I thought he was seriously on his way up, but he was there for an extra quarter of a second.

1158
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I'm going to try that again though.

1159
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I'm going to do it again.

1160
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Somebody's texting me.

1161
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Who's texting me?

1162
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Oh.

1163
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Star wants me to play his levels.

1164
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Star text me your levels because...

1165
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
My computer is being aware of it right now.

1166
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Text me your two levels.

1167
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I want to beat this one though.

1168
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:10,000
This one's interesting.

1169
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Get away from me.

1170
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Thank God this is just a visual.

1171
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,000
There's nothing else.

1172
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Whoa, shit.

1173
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:32,000
That was close.

1174
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Oh boy, that last one really is just so.

1175
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
So.

1176
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Buh.

1177
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Yeah, text me your levels.

1178
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I'll play them.

1179
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I might just do that so he can go to bed.

1180
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
He wants to go to bed.

1181
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Poor Star.

1182
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Poor Star has been waiting for me to play his Mario Maker level.

1183
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:57,000
And I just haven't done it.

1184
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:03,000
He's there really.

1185
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
That was happening.

1186
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
I didn't get a good look at what's down here.

1187
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I might just die right now.

1188
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Can I box like that?

1189
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I wonder if I...

1190
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I think I can.

1191
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I can.

1192
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,000
See you later.

1193
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
That was...

1194
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
I like that level.

1195
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
That was really cool.

1196
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,000
That was a very interesting level.

1197
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
You can butt slide everything.

1198
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Yeah, you probably can.

1199
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Let me see what he's writing to me.

1200
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
All right.

1201
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I got stars levels.

1202
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I get it.

1203
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I get it.

1204
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I get it.

1205
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
You're texting me.

1206
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I get it.

1207
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Now you just maybe die.

1208
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
God, we get it.

1209
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
You want me to play your level.

1210
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Blowing up my phone.

1211
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I have no idea.

1212
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I guess you just have to.

1213
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Oh, shit.

1214
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,000
There's a lot of stuff going on here, man.

1215
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:46,000
It's too scary to move.

1216
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
No.

1217
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
That's it.

1218
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Oh, my God.

1219
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
All right.

1220
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
We're going to play stars level.

1221
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Because this one's out of control.

1222
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Take him quick.

1223
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Sure.

1224
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Why not?

1225
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,000
So...

1226
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Oh, coursepot.

1227
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:28,000
What does coursepot even do?

1228
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:33,000
How do you just put in a course?

1229
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:48,000
You just go to Maker or something?

1230
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Okay, there we go.

1231
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
So here you go, guys.

1232
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Here's your star level number one.

1233
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:10,000
What the fuck?

1234
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Not as zero as in this one.

1235
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
All right.

1236
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
This is called Pound Town.

1237
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Oh, this is actually Ashley's level.

1238
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
This is not stars level.

1239
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I don't think maybe it is.

1240
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Maybe he just didn't change his avatar.

1241
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
All right, Pound Town.

1242
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Whoa, almost got me.

1243
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Yeah, almost had me there.

1244
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Again, again, again.

1245
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
No, he tell me.

1246
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
See?

1247
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
He thought I was going to fall for it again.

1248
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
He's got to be something in this last one.

1249
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
No.

1250
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Oh, sacred blocks.

1251
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
And a star.

1252
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,000
We're just going to go up.

1253
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
No, we're not.

1254
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
We're going to go right back down.

1255
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I could have used that star.

1256
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
What else is back here?

1257
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Let's explore the rest of it.

1258
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Okay, jumpy springy.

1259
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Lots of spikes.

1260
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Put this here.

1261
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Now let's go right there.

1262
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:48,000
No, put it down.

1263
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Another little...

1264
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Ooh, this is a fly thing.

1265
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
What else is over here?

1266
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Interesting spikes, a bullet bill.

1267
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Get out of here.

1268
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Look at this.

1269
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Look at this.

1270
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Look at this.

1271
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Oh, there's a little bit of a thought to do.

1272
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,000
This process.

1273
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Ooh, I didn't really even notice that one.

1274
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Get out of here.

1275
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I didn't even need that.

1276
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
How long does this level take you?

1277
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Whoa.

1278
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
It's going to happen again.

1279
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Well, that was dumb.

1280
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Yeah.

1281
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
All right.

1282
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
All right.

1283
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Nice.

1284
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Very, very nice.

1285
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I'm not going to do that one this time.

1286
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
There we go.

1287
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
There's the mushroom I was looking for.

1288
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Well, now I can't get this.

1289
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
You know what?

1290
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I'll take some damage.

1291
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Why not?

1292
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I'm going to go back up there.

1293
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I guess I can't.

1294
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
It was the middle one, right?

1295
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Yes, it was.

1296
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Hmm.

1297
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Let's move.

1298
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I don't even need that right now.

1299
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I can just do this.

1300
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Oh, my God.

1301
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Why would I look over?

1302
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Why did I look over at my monitor to read the chat?

1303
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I saw a star set something in mid-jump.

1304
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I looked over and was like, what do you say?

1305
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
That was not smart at all.

1306
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I'm not going to be able to do that.

1307
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Hit me.

1308
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Oh, shit.

1309
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I waited like way too long.

1310
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I don't even need to do that.

1311
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Let's just go.

1312
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
We saw all the sites.

1313
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
We can leave now.

1314
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Maybe we can't.

1315
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
No, we're not.

1316
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
We're not going to leave that.

1317
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
We're going to get the thing that's in here.

1318
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Because we have to.

1319
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Because it's so easy to get the star and just sprint through everything.

1320
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Run.

1321
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Ding dong.

1322
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Watch out for that thing again.

1323
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Don't jump into it.

1324
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I come up.

1325
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Is there a secret up there?

1326
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Should I be aware of a secret?

1327
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1328
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:28,000
We have to see what it is.

1329
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
You put him on a...

1330
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Oh, he's over here.

1331
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:37,000
He's going to keep deleting things, isn't he?

1332
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Where does this go?

1333
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:45,000
What's going to keep going?

1334
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
He's going to break this and then what do I gain from doing this?

1335
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Nothing.

1336
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I guess there's just nothing here.

1337
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Maybe I could just go on the pipe.

1338
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Can I even...

1339
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Am I going to make that?

1340
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Find out.

1341
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Oh, yeah, it's right.

1342
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
You go back to the start.

1343
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Oh, that's cool.

1344
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
All right, well, I got to the end of that one.

1345
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I wanted to see what was in your secret troll pipe.

1346
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Let's do the other one.

1347
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:28,000
There's two more.

1348
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
So who was that yours?

1349
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Was that Ashley's?

1350
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I don't know how to rate it.

1351
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Yeah, are you going to do something with that pipe?

1352
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Is that pipe just designed for you to go run all the way backwards?

1353
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Or is your plan to put something else there?

1354
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Like a one-up mushroom.

1355
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Here's another star level.

1356
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:33,000
And six, two, three.

1357
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Firetown.

1358
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Very creative with these names, by the way.

1359
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Firetown, pound, town.

1360
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:53,000
You get really good with these cities.

1361
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
You're going to do that to me the whole level.

1362
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Killing me.

1363
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Okay.

1364
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
So I'm safe if I...

1365
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
No, those go...

1366
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I'm going to remiss.

1367
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
All right, I'm going to remiss.

1368
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I'll slow those things.

1369
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:16,000
What else is in here?

1370
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Oh, whoa, easy.

1371
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Easy with the hidden block there, buddy.

1372
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Look at that.

1373
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Look what he's doing here.

1374
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,000
He thinks he's such a clever little shit, doesn't he?

1375
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I don't know what that is at a wall.

1376
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I can't tell.

1377
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Is that a wall?

1378
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:44,000
No, it's not.

1379
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
You see that was very good.

1380
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Very good.

1381
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I'm a fan of this level because of that, you know,

1382
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
that be careful.

1383
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
You could get hit by this shit.

1384
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Very nice.

1385
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Very nice.

1386
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I'm enjoying it.

1387
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
See, I didn't time that right.

1388
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I forgot.

1389
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I didn't realize it were on the different spectrums.

1390
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
What was the first one come up right there?

1391
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I don't know.

1392
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I forget what these enemies do.

1393
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Can I destroy them by going like this?

1394
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:30,000
No, I can do that.

1395
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Whoa.

1396
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Ooh, very, very clever.

1397
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Very nice.

1398
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
What else we got?

1399
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
What else we got?

1400
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Okay.

1401
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Anything else down here?

1402
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Get a dangerous mushroom.

1403
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Those are going to keep coming all the way, aren't they?

1404
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:04,000
They're going to start exploding.

1405
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Ah, I got two cocky.

1406
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I got two cocky there.

1407
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I should have waited.

1408
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Two cocky.

1409
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
This one, I like this because this, what's with the bomb?

1410
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,000
With that bomb guy, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's with this broken bugged out fucking level?

1411
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
What's with this broken buggy technical mess of a level?

1412
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:32,000
That bomb guy came back and was there and ruined my run.

1413
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Actually, I probably just, can I do that?

1414
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
That's very, very dangerous.

1415
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
But it might be fun to try.

1416
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Do you, is this encouraged star?

1417
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Is this something you wanted to try to get people to do?

1418
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Is, is it one, two, three, one, two, three?

1419
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Now, I guess not.

1420
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I'm sure it's probably possible, but not a probable thing to get every time I would assume.

1421
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Watch out!

1422
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:29,000
You need to have a lot of patience with this.

1423
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I actually was trying to kill that guy.

1424
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
I guess you can't hit them.

1425
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I'm worth the shot.

1426
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Ooh, I just figured out what you are attending people to do here.

1427
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Interesting.

1428
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
So you, you want to get somebody to blow that up.

1429
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
So, okay, that's cool.

1430
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
You drop one down there and expose the wall.

1431
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
You can get the mushroom if you want.

1432
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
That's cool, dude. Very cool.

1433
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Very cool.

1434
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
And you got those shooting over.

1435
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Wow, you know, I'm impressed.

1436
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Doesn't do much.

1437
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Okay, apparently I hit that button twice.

1438
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
That's the end right there.

1439
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Why the fuck did that happen?

1440
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
It just went like, dude, dude.

1441
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Shouldn't have done that twice. That was the end.

1442
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
So you got to bring a bomb over.

1443
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Cool.

1444
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
I swear, man.

1445
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:18,000
I swear this controller does like fucking ghostly shit.

1446
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I'm telling you, this is the, these game pads are possessed by fucking Satan.

1447
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I was trying to save that.

1448
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I don't need the mushroom.

1449
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Oh no, we're gonna fall.

1450
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Didn't do anything over here, did you?

1451
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:07,000
No.

1452
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Oh, I guess trying to do the thing.

1453
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Oh, fuck, it shut the other side.

1454
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
I'm just sitting there waiting for it to explode.

1455
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:21,000
I was sitting there waiting for it to explode.

1456
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I was like, get out of here, bomb.

1457
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Woohoo!

1458
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Hmm.

1459
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Ha ha, I got him.

1460
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Not even to worry about that.

1461
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
He can just dog him.

1462
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I do see this fish here, though.

1463
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:23,000
I can't kill him with the fire.

1464
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Oh, one of the feet.

1465
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Hot feet, hot foot.

1466
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Okay, I got a bring one.

1467
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I got a bring one.

1468
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I just have to kite him over here.

1469
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Yay!

1470
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Alright, what weird shit did you put at Bowser?

1471
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Oh, I guess nothing.

1472
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:12,000
That was cool, though.

1473
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:19,000
I like the bomb aspect of it.

1474
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I like the character development with the bomb.

1475
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I'm just gonna get out of the cannon and start to flash red and finally explode.

1476
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Alright, let's do Ashley's level now.

1477
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:41,000
This Ashley's is actually a town level as well.

1478
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:48,000
We'll find out.

1479
01:43:48,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Watch him just really, really just get under my skin right here and just give me the code to a level that is one of the impossible ones.

1480
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Yeah, it's pretty easy.

1481
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Just give it a try.

1482
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
It's pretty fun.

1483
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Spiny tank invasion.

1484
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:31,000
You got it.

1485
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Whoa, we're already moving.

1486
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
We're already moving.

1487
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:43,000
That was expected.

1488
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Wow!

1489
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Alright.

1490
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:51,000
So you got to go over, bounce, over, bounce.

1491
01:44:51,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Wow, okay, I did that way too early.

1492
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Shit!

1493
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:09,000
This one's gonna take a little bit of practice, I think.

1494
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Jesus!

1495
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Wow!

1496
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:30,000
I don't know, Star, I think this one might be harder than yours.

1497
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:44,000
There we go.

1498
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Oh, boy!

1499
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:56,000
There's another thing to jump on.

1500
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Oh my goodness.

1501
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Oh my god!

1502
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:20,000
That 140 second input delay is going to try to be crazy.

1503
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:27,000
And no.

1504
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I didn't even do it.

1505
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Wow!

1506
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Oh my god!

1507
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Who yikes?

1508
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Oh!

1509
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:57,000
This is hard.

1510
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Come on, two.

1511
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:11,000
You know, maybe I should just jump over that.

1512
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Now I did too early.

1513
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Did it too early?

1514
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Too early.

1515
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:36,000
One more.

1516
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Holy shit!

1517
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Those are spaced differently as well.

1518
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Oh my god!

1519
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:58,000
It's a B press B and you jump and it doesn't like to want to do.

1520
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:04,000
It doesn't like to work its thing.

1521
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Oh.

1522
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Find the hidden blocks.

1523
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Nope, that's it.

1524
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I can't go over it.

1525
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Jump.

1526
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Oh my god!

1527
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:44,000
The spacing on those is so perfect for you to lose.

1528
01:48:44,000 --> 01:49:06,000
That is an evil, evil, evil shit.

1529
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:13,000
I'm going to get too long.

1530
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:24,000
So you got to hit the second one on the last one, don't you?

1531
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:31,000
I'll get it.

1532
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I will get it, don't worry.

1533
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:45,000
I got it.

1534
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:51,000
I don't know.

1535
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I'm having trouble with that last one.

1536
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:03,000
I don't have enough speed.

1537
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Maybe I should jump first.

1538
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Yeah, that maybe.

1539
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:18,000
No, that was unnecessary.

1540
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Jump.

1541
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Oh my god!

1542
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:38,000
So you have to land on the first one, I guess.

1543
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:45,000
What the fuck?

1544
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:50,000
What is going on right now?

1545
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Why do I keep hitting the side of this right now?

1546
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:07,000
There we are.

1547
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:14,000
No, it didn't do it.

1548
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Run the fucking recording back.

1549
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Listen to me press the button and it didn't work.

1550
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Run it back.

1551
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:36,000
You'll hear it and you'll go, oh my god, he's right.

1552
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:42,000
I did it.

1553
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Check the tape on that one, you'll be like, oh shit.

1554
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
The gamepad is a bad controller, it has like three frames of lag.

1555
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I know it sucks.

1556
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
It sucks using this thing.

1557
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:06,000
But until I get a plugged in controller, I have to deal with it.

1558
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Look, I cleared it.

1559
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
50 attempts.

1560
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I did it.

1561
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Oh, is that, did I didn't do 50 attempts?

1562
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Did I do no?

1563
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Did you beat this one?

1564
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Why didn't you beat this one, Star?

1565
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:35,000
What the heck?

1566
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
What else is here?

1567
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Do you guys have any more levels?

1568
01:52:45,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Why am I not Skyping or in a call with Star?

1569
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:21,000
The audio delay is so long when you're capping a console that I have to offset it.

1570
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:32,000
So he'd come in and he'd react to things like four seconds too late.

1571
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I wonder if there's a game mode on this TV because isn't there something to do with like the TV sometimes too?

1572
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I wonder if there's a game mode on this TV.

1573
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I wonder if there's a game mode on this TV.

1574
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:58,000
I wonder if there's a game mode on this TV.

1575
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Let's see.

1576
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Noise reduction.

1577
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Why would I want noise reduction?

1578
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I don't think this TV has any of those problems.

1579
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I guess I don't think it has anything for it.

1580
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I know that can be a problem.

1581
01:54:50,000 --> 01:55:02,000
What's featured today?

1582
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Let's take a look.

1583
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Scroll madness.

1584
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:22,000
12,000 attempts.

1585
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I don't think I should be doing this.

1586
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:36,000
You probably won't read this good night, Jerma.

1587
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:46,000
I can delay the audio coming in from me.

1588
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:53,000
But that didn't let him his head.

1589
01:55:54,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Look at all those X's.

1590
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Got a stagger in there.

1591
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Wow.

1592
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:25,000
How do you turn off comments?

1593
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Is there a way to do it?

1594
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Oh, comment.

1595
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:41,000
That's how you make a comment.

1596
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I looked up some tutorials, Ronnie, to see a stagger.

1597
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:59,000
There were a few tutorials explaining how to do it, but still.

1598
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I wish I had an explanation for why that happened.

1599
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:10,000
If I could explain to you why that just happened, I would block him.

1600
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Yikes.

1601
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Oh, dear.

1602
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Boy.

1603
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:51,000
So this level with the 12,000 attempts and the 1% clear rate, I think I just wanted to see what it was.

1604
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I'll give it like maybe five or ten more attempts.

1605
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Geez.

1606
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:12,000
That alone, I probably shouldn't even do that second the last jump.

1607
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:26,000
That one again.

1608
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Is it just because the big brick gamepad has the teeny tiny, tiny little analog, not analog, the D-pad?

1609
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Maybe my big ass thumb is pressing every single button because the D-pad is as big as a thumb.

1610
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Next time you're playing on this big brick, hold your thumb up.

1611
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:50,000
It's going to take over the entire D-pad.

1612
01:58:50,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Is it good that it's as big enough for one button for you to press?

1613
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Shit.

1614
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I could get there.

1615
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I wasn't breaking the button.

1616
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I'm not going to do that.

1617
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:38,000
I'm not going to do that.

1618
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I'm not going to do that.

1619
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:53,000
See, I don't have to, you can just count go.

1620
01:59:53,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Oh, I missed it.

1621
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
I missed it.

1622
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I missed it.

1623
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I had that.

1624
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I was going pretty well too.

1625
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Oh, I know I should be using literally anything but the gamepad.

1626
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
But I don't have anything.

1627
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:23,000
The only thing I have is the Wii U, not the Wii U, the standard Wii mode.

1628
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:30,000
And I've heard that's just as bad.

1629
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I'm not getting it.

1630
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I've already lost it.

1631
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Nope, I can't.

1632
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:48,000
I probably could have.

1633
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Oh, come on.

1634
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Oh, stop doing that.

1635
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I don't know why I'm still doing this.

1636
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:10,000
I really feel like I can do this.

1637
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Oh boy, I should just get it so I can take a hit.

1638
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I don't know why that doesn't work at the time.

1639
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I'm going to have to come back to this level.

1640
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Once I get a control, I'll come back.

1641
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:35,000
We'll do one or two more attempts.

1642
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I have to damage this.

1643
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:45,000
The whole way to land and then jump within 30 milliseconds.

1644
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I wish there was a way.

1645
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:59,000
I'm just going to get that.

1646
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I'm not doing it right.

1647
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Holy shit, go down, please.

1648
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,000
I'm still scrolling.

1649
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Well, I don't know what's happening.

1650
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Oh, I just freaked out.

1651
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,000
I just don't know what's going on.

1652
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
It was disco.

1653
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Do you see the disco party that was happening?

1654
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,000
I don't know.

1655
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,000
I don't know.

1656
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I think I just figured it out.

1657
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I think you have to jump into it.

1658
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Well, that's how it always happens.

1659
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:47,000
One or two more attempts and then you end up playing for like two hours.

1660
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Please let me attach and jump.

1661
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Is the pro controller is good, right?

1662
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
For the wheel.

1663
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Or should I get the classic, the original classic controller?

1664
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Almost screwed that up.

1665
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Okay.

1666
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:29,000
That's all I had to do.

1667
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:35,000
This is over here.

1668
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Oh, one of these.

1669
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I feel like a wow.

1670
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Oh, come on.

1671
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Okay, this is the final.

1672
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,000
No, no, no, this is the final attempt.

1673
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Last one.

1674
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Final attempt.

1675
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Jump, please, you fucking slug.

1676
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
No, that one didn't count.

1677
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:33,000
That one doesn't count.

1678
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,000
I have to get back to that like last part.

1679
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Very the one I was just at.

1680
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:57,000
That one didn't count.

1681
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:03,000
I'm not gonna say I get it.

1682
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,000
But I didn't get it.

1683
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Never let it end.

1684
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,000
No, it has to end very soon.

1685
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Before I have a fucking hard attack.

1686
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,000
I'm trying to stagger it.

1687
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Oh, my god.

1688
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Add me to like the 2000 attempts to this.

1689
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,000
I'm just speaking.

1690
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Playing these difficult levels.

1691
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Something about it.

1692
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,000
It scratches some weird fucking dumb fucked up itch in your brain.

1693
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
What you have to do it.

1694
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,000
You just have to keep doing it.

1695
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:46,000
I just have to keep going.

1696
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,000
I can quit, I can quit whatever I want.

1697
02:05:50,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Really, really, really, really, really, really sloppy.

1698
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
What I keep doing.

1699
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:19,000
What am I keep doing wrong here?

1700
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
That's what I wanted to do.

1701
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,000
I didn't want this to be even more difficult now.

1702
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Oh boy, what?

1703
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:31,000
What was that?

1704
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Holy shit, where am I?

1705
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
What happened?

1706
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,000
What the fuck?

1707
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
That's the end.

1708
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
That's the end of the level.

1709
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,000
That's the very end.

1710
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
That's the very end.

1711
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,000
That's the very end of the fucking level.

1712
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
That's, I beat it.

1713
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,000
That's the end.

1714
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
That's the end.

1715
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
That's the end of the level.

1716
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:56,000
You see that?

1717
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:12,000
I'm freaking out right now, that's the end.

1718
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
I just did it.

1719
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I did it.

1720
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,000
I beat the level.

1721
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Stop.

1722
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
I won.

1723
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Okay.

1724
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:25,000
I just beat it.

1725
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Very cool.

1726
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
That was a fun one.

1727
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Yeah.

1728
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Not even hard.

1729
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Not even hard.

1730
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
One percent.

1731
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:59,000
If only we all were bad enough to fall down that hole to find that.

1732
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Can I see?

1733
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
I want to download it.

1734
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
I can download this, right?

1735
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I take a look at it.

1736
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Because I'm curious as to like what the outs is there.

1737
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:16,000
I'm going to put it here.

1738
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,000
I want to take a look at that.

1739
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Because if you do it the right way, I wonder.

1740
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:29,000
That's fine.

1741
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Let's take a look here.

1742
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Because here's okay.

1743
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
You jump over this.

1744
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Bang, bang, point, point, point up here.

1745
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Watch out for this.

1746
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Watch out for that.

1747
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Oh no, we're going to be going.

1748
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:49,000
And then in here.

1749
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Okay.

1750
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:55,000
You can go down here too.

1751
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Really.

1752
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:03,000
That's interesting.

1753
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Put it in there.

1754
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
How do you make him go in?

1755
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:17,000
I haven't been really playing with this particular part.

1756
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:26,000
How do I get him to go in here?

1757
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Can I just like play some here?

1758
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
I haven't been making a hole.

1759
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:37,000
I haven't even had the opportunity to do this.

1760
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:45,000
I guess I could just play test it.

1761
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Hold on.

1762
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Look, there's a lot more.

1763
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:54,000
You go through this whole thing.

1764
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
You have to do any of this.

1765
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Go all the way around this.

1766
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Look at this.

1767
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,000
This is why it's 1%.

1768
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Look at how much you have to go through.

1769
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:08,000
This is where I think you'd be holding up most people.

1770
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
This is because they shoot the crap out.

1771
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,000
They shoot all the spikes and everything.

1772
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:21,000
And getting back there must just be so annoying every time.

1773
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,000
There's another cloud right there too, just in case you fail here and have to stop.

1774
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,000
What are these things?

1775
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Those are the chops.

1776
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Let's just do it.

1777
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Let me see.

1778
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:41,000
I'm interested.

1779
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:44,000
I was waiting for them to move.

1780
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I was waiting for them to move.

1781
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Did that will they move?

1782
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I hope that they did like the launch at you.

1783
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Currently these ones don't.

1784
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Wow.

1785
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:08,000
That's a pain in the ass.

1786
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I guess it's not too bad.

1787
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Yeah, it is.

1788
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Especially because they're still coming after you at that point too.

1789
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Yeah, I wonder what the school checked that too.

1790
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Let's go look.

1791
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:35,000
You got the chain chops to deal with here.

1792
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:39,000
I'm assuming this is going to bring you right to where Baby Bowser is.

1793
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Where I wait, you fall.

1794
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Yeah.

1795
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,000
That's crazy.

1796
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:48,000
That is crazy.

1797
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
The underwater set will arrive.

1798
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Okay.

1799
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Thanks.

1800
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Thanks, Nintendo.

1801
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Is there anything else here?

1802
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:08,000
That's crazy how easy that is if you just get there and fall down.

1803
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:16,000
See, in my opinion, I would delete these blocks.

1804
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,000
So you can't see that that's down there.

1805
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:26,000
And I would probably even delete like these.

1806
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Just to make it so it's not.

1807
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:31,000
If you jump down there, you find that.

1808
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:34,000
It's still kind of difficult to land there.

1809
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:41,000
I don't know.

1810
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
It's still cool though.

1811
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
It's still interesting.

1812
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Hard jumping around.

1813
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:51,000
This was not that hard.

1814
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Very cool.

1815
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:03,000
What is that annoying cat hand?

1816
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
This is the featured one.

1817
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
What else is here?

1818
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Look at this one.

1819
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
What is going on in this one?

1820
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:15,000
It's just a big long line.

1821
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Check it out.

1822
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:28,000
I thought it was going to go across.

1823
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,000
I have to kill everything.

1824
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Like that.

1825
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Okay.

1826
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,000
I mean, I would feed a star's level.

1827
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Man, Ashley's level was much more complicated than that.

1828
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Why is that one featured?

1829
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:09,000
It seems like somebody just made a line of goombas.

1830
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,000
I was waiting for something to happen.

1831
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Goomba castle.

1832
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Koopa castle.

1833
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Mega castle.

1834
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:24,000
What is going on in this one?

1835
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,000
There's a gigantic gap here.

1836
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Check it out.

1837
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Well, 33% clear rate.

1838
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,000
I'm assuming that a lot of people did what I just did.

1839
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:38,000
And that's just like walk into the thing that hits you.

1840
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:42,000
From the shell when you hit the shell across the way.

1841
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:52,000
There's that.

1842
02:14:52,000 --> 02:15:02,000
What the hell is going on here?

1843
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Why is bother stuck in there?

1844
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Is there some item in there?

1845
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,000
I'm Mega Man now.

1846
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Can I shoot?

1847
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Maybe I can.

1848
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Oh, this is going to do anything.

1849
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Okay.

1850
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:45,000
It's one way to do it.

1851
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:48,000
I get to be a spring.

1852
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Chalk this up to the things that make sense.

1853
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Trying just to get off the thing.

1854
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:58,000
And a star.

1855
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:01,000
I can't go through those with a star.

1856
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,000
What's up with that?

1857
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Oh, that's why they gave me the star.

1858
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Okay.

1859
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:19,000
I don't think I need to see any more of this one.

1860
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Everyone else, let's try to complete it.

1861
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Let's sake it.

1862
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Now that I know that there's no reason to do anything here.

1863
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I did.

1864
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
They just hit this one.

1865
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Oh, God.

1866
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:44,000
There.

1867
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Wee.

1868
02:16:51,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I don't think I'm going to be the spring for theirs.

1869
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Okay.

1870
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Okay.

1871
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Well, we're going to do another one.

1872
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
That one was very odd.

1873
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I did say I was stopping like 10 minutes ago, but sometimes it's just got to keep playing.

1874
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:30,000
I mean, I'm still up, right?

1875
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I'm going to get big.

1876
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Look at this one.

1877
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:37,000
It's long and it's complicated.

1878
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Start ranking.

1879
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,000
I believe we've already seen this one.

1880
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:52,000
But let's look at it again.

1881
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,000
This is one of the automatic ones where you don't do anything.

1882
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Yeah, we saw this one, I think.

1883
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:02,000
No, we didn't.

1884
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
How many hours do you think it takes?

1885
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
I don't know if Starf you're watching right now because you're like, may I?

1886
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
There'll be those made levels.

1887
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:14,000
How long does something like this take to do realistically in hours?

1888
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:19,000
More than 20?

1889
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:23,000
More than 30?

1890
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Because this is outrageous.

1891
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
It's completely and totally outlanded.

1892
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:32,000
You're able to do something like this in this game.

1893
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Yeah, I feel like I'm looking at a motherboard.

1894
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:47,000
It doesn't look like a computer.

1895
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:52,000
This hasn't stopped.

1896
02:18:52,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Less than 10 hours.

1897
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,000
No, poor Yoshi.

1898
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Look at Yoshi's running on the treadmill so fast.

1899
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Somebody save him.

1900
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:20,000
No, sweet.

1901
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:24,000
This is a lot of testing that I'm actually hard to make.

1902
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:29,000
I would lose my place hundreds of times.

1903
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:34,000
I would get to a point where I made something like that and then something would go wrong in the middle.

1904
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:39,000
And I would lose my mind and I just realized that that's Bowser's face.

1905
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
That is Bowser's face, right?

1906
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:44,000
That's a really, really cool good job.

1907
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Great work.

1908
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Is that the one we saw on the Mario Kart one?

1909
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:54,000
It's a May race.

1910
02:19:54,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Okay.

1911
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Run.

1912
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:11,000
It's a music level, huh?

1913
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Fantastic.

1914
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Oh, cool.

1915
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I could just do this.

1916
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Fuck playing the game and getting mad at all, dying and losing over and over again.

1917
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:43,000
I want to just see people make music and do automatic fun levels.

1918
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:46,000
There are over 1,000 comments.

1919
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Zelda song.

1920
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Let's hear the Zelda song.

1921
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:06,000
That's cool that you can actually put notes to actually have.

1922
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:15,000
No, I don't want to end.

1923
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:18,000
No, that wasn't the end.

1924
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Come on back.

1925
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Come back so I can see the rest of the song.

1926
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
It'll come back.

1927
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,000
It'll come back.

1928
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Don't worry.

1929
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,000
I'll be freaked out.

1930
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Oh, okay.

1931
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Now let's do it in reverse.

1932
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Come on.

1933
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Yeah.

1934
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Let's start over.

1935
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Let's see.

1936
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Does anyone have a Pac-Man song?

1937
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Smash.

1938
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Smash.

1939
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Look at all that shit.

1940
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Smash Brothers theme.

1941
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Which one?

1942
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Is more?

1943
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:45,000
How would you even be able to know that was happening?

1944
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:51,000
There are some people out there that just are very good at things.

1945
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Making a level like that must just be so fun for those people to make.

1946
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
That's so, that's so awesome.

1947
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I'm so glad that stuff like that exists for everyone to enjoy.

1948
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Nice job, Matt.

1949
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:17,000
No wonder these are like the most highest rated ones.

1950
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Don't touch the sheroom.

1951
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Did I do this one?

1952
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Is this the one that I did earlier?

1953
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Or is this a different one?

1954
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:27,000
This one only has a 13% clear.

1955
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:31,000
I'm not good at everybody's good at something.

1956
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,000
I lost.

1957
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:39,000
I touched this room.

1958
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Restart.

1959
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Oh shit.

1960
02:23:53,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Can I get hit by something?

1961
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Oh, I can get it down there.

1962
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Why does this only have a 13% clear?

1963
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:16,000
I can't get it down there.

1964
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:24,000
I can't get it down there.

1965
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:29,000
I can't get it down there.

1966
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Oh, whatever.

1967
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:36,000
That's cool.

1968
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Well, you made that map.

1969
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I know I'm brilliant and made that map.

1970
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:45,000
If that's true, then you did that good job.

1971
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:48,000
We saw that at the sonic level.

1972
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
What was up and comes?

1973
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Let's take a look at the up and coming list.

1974
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Might have to backtrack hard.

1975
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Let's just take a look at it.

1976
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:09,000
I'm going to be the first person to play this level.

1977
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:12,000
No one else has attempted it.

1978
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:17,000
How is this an up and coming level of no one has played it?

1979
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:20,000
How does this level has a 13% clear right?

1980
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Looks at it in the leaves.

1981
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Yeah, I'm a contributing factor that.

1982
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:32,000
For sure.

1983
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:36,000
I'm just throwing shit around for fun.

1984
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Walking into it.

1985
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:45,000
You know how it is.

1986
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:52,000
I missed.

1987
02:25:52,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Check everything.

1988
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Check everything.

1989
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Check for the top ones.

1990
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Just jump on his head.

1991
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Is this going to be one of those star levels where I need the bombs to explode on something?

1992
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:28,000
I feel like it could be.

1993
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Got this asshole now.

1994
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:47,000
That's one way to do it.

1995
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Yoshi, am I need to get him?

1996
02:26:52,000 --> 02:27:02,000
I thought you could eat those.

1997
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I was certain you could eat those.

1998
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I need them.

1999
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:13,000
No, Yoshi, come back.

2000
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:16,000
I'm going to fall apart here.

2001
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:27,000
They look like they could have been something down there.

2002
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Just checking it all out.

2003
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:41,000
What else is new?

2004
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Oh, nothing.

2005
02:27:48,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Give me cloud guy again.

2006
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:08,000
I want to get that out.

2007
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:15,000
I guess it's right here.

2008
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:22,000
I'm going to get it.

2009
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Yoshi.

2010
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:34,000
What is going on here?

2011
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Okay.

2012
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Should I have gone up and around?

2013
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:50,000
I think it's just a matter of time.

2014
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:54,000
I think it's just a matter of time.

2015
02:28:54,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I think it's just a matter of time.

2016
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:08,000
I don't know.

2017
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Come on, all you don't.

2018
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:38,000
I guess you can't go up.

2019
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,000
I think I've screwed this one up.

2020
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I guess you just don't get into this thing.

2021
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:50,000
You have to go down.

2022
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
I'm just going to skip that.

2023
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:59,000
I'm going to go up.

2024
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:05,000
I'm going to go down.

2025
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:10,000
I'm going to go up.

2026
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:17,000
I'm going to go up.

2027
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:24,000
I feel like this person had to go to bed.

2028
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:31,000
They made this level and they started it.

2029
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:35,000
We have at least two or three bosses at the end of our level.

2030
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:42,000
We'll redo it.

2031
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:50,000
I'm not going to keep this moving.

2032
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:57,000
We're not going to even get in the same.

2033
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:27,000
I'm going to go up.

2034
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:32,000
What the hell is happening right now?

2035
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Why am I running into all these hidden blocks?

2036
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:49,000
I saw the arrow pointing up in the beginning.

2037
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:56,000
That's what we're going to do.

2038
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:02,000
T2 come over here.

2039
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Come over here.

2040
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Let's go.

2041
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:21,000
What's going on?

2042
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:27,000
I was just stuck up there.

2043
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:32,000
This is what Yoshi is for.

2044
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Yoshi.

2045
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:46,000
You got to go in the cloud with Yoshi.

2046
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:53,000
The cloud car.

2047
02:32:53,000 --> 02:33:00,000
The cloud car.

2048
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:06,000
I want to make him angry.

2049
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:27,000
I want that thing to redden angry at me.

2050
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Let's go get in the cloud car.

2051
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Why don't I think that's so funny?

2052
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:46,000
I don't want to be in this.

2053
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:53,000
I'm going to get in the cloud car.

2054
02:33:53,000 --> 02:34:00,000
I'm going to get in the cloud car.

2055
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Nope.

2056
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:09,000
What does that mean?

2057
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:16,000
He told me no.

2058
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:22,000
He told me no.

2059
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:29,000
I didn't believe him.

2060
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:36,000
I'm going to be like, what are you doing?

2061
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:43,000
What are you doing?

2062
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Oh, shit.

2063
02:34:52,000 --> 02:35:06,000
I'm not going to have any more fun.

2064
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:11,000
I'm not going to do it this time.

2065
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Don't worry.

2066
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:25,000
No.

2067
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:32,000
What a troll.

2068
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:37,000
He trolled us.

2069
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:44,000
I will take one cloud car.

2070
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:50,000
I wish I had stopped doing that.

2071
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:59,000
I'm trying to do the song.

2072
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Here comes the nope.

2073
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:13,000
Nobody tells me no.

2074
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:20,000
I'm kidding.

2075
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Cheese.

2076
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:42,000
I'm going to get in the cloud car.

2077
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:49,000
I'm going to get in the cloud car.

2078
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:56,000
I'm going to get in the cloud car.

2079
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:03,000
I'm going to get in the cloud car.

2080
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:10,000
I'm going to get in the cloud car.

2081
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:17,000
I'm going to get in the cloud car.

2082
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:24,000
I'm going to get in the cloud car.

2083
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:31,000
I'm going to get in the cloud car.

2084
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:38,000
I'm going to get in the cloud car.

2085
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:46,000
I'm going to get in the cloud car.

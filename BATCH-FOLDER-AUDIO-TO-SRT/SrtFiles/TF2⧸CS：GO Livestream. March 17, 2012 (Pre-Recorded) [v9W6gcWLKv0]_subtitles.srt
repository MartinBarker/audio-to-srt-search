Gotta tell my steam group what's going on

I get I got a lot of mixed responses a lot of people are like no go to Twitch and then people say no YouTube is much better

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's torn between two different places

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But eventually I'm gonna be able to stream an HD on here so that should be pretty cool. Why can't I go to my steam group?

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
King of Hill, New Cleans. Let's go to New Cleans

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000

58
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And here it comes we'll let everybody go

59
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yo, my stream is broken

60
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
My stream isn't broken is it

61
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I

62
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Try and refresh it give it a good old refresh

63
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
All right join that I just put a IP into the chat that's where I'm gonna be playing

64
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh

65
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Using the vlog estimator

66
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000

67
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And ready even in here

68
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
All right, Weston if some of you guys could repost the IP I would be very grateful

69
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You have a male what's going on chicken

70
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So I have a new mouse we're gonna see how well this goes

71
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And I don't hit that guy I got a razor death at her. Oh

72
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah, razor death at her. It's the blue one I'm gonna lights up blue

73
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And if I'm gonna give never gonna give

74
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So a lot of people can't load the stream. I wonder why

75
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Everything should be the same as it was last time

76
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Is it is more than one person having stream problems or is it just one or two people?

77
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Error huh hold on a second

78
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's weird

79
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The people that are having problems with what what country from

80
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It might be because you're from a country that doesn't support or something

81
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
YouTube is still in kind of like a debate of streaming stages

82
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh my god

83
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I can't believe I well

84
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
How

85
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, if you're I guess if you're having stream problems

86
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Just close out your browser and then come back or clear out some of your cookies or something like that

87
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't know I wish I knew what was going on because if everybody was having that problem

88
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I would be like dog and I'd have to like fix it right away

89
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh, that was so lucky

90
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh, you're the spy

91
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000

92
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Gonna pull it up for a second here. Let's see what it looks like for me

93
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Expedia, let's see

94
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Why not just get a double at

95
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I got a double add on my own stream

96
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll offer a sacrifice to YouTube. I mean looks yeah, I'll show you guys we'll do streamception

97
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It looks all right on my end. I don't know

98
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm not sure guys. I apologize if it doesn't look like that on your screen

99
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000

00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Put a lot of pressure on me here

104
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No, it's not a spy

105
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh my god, it's alive. I'm so bad

106
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000

109
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The black box reserve shooter in the equalizer and I got this stuff on too

111
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000

All right, so I'm getting a couple more messages saying the stream is all screwed up

115
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You know we're gonna do this right we'll do this

116
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm not sure if I can even restart it to be honest

117
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It might like screw a bunch of stuff up

118
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes

119
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000

Oh crap no die

122
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Well the only thing I could say is if people are still having problems and then

123
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This should be uploaded to youtube within the next hour or two

124
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You should be able to watch it on youtube

125
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I

126
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Don't make me I'll try every start because that looks like more people are having problems

127
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Control point and they will get going

129
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This fits comfortably

130
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Where oh my god the railside the door that's just like scared the crap out of me

131

Let's get out of here. Come on spy. Let's get the hell out of here

133
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm lagging so bad

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Look at all bad of lagging right now everyone's like a freaking slide show

135
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Streamception

136
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I

137
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Did I did I kill that guy that I just confused myself

138
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Oh

Yeah, I actually know it if some of you guys will notice I have quick switch on now

143
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I am not using the regular non-quicks which anymore because I can do stuff like this

144
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
See how I switch to that because I got a button on my thumb now

145
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I can use the button on my thumb to switch to the um to the melee slot

146
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Cool, huh? No more no more slow switch for germa those are the days of the past

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
All right, well whatever this works

161
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I

162
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Nice big century baby

163
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000

166
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000

The girl I have is I want you know any dating advice do I have any dating advice um

168
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The only dating advice I could give is

I don't know I'm not really the best at oh, I gotta I gotta take this off

170

I'm not really the best at dating advice to be honest

171
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
If I had any I would definitely give it to you

172
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I

173
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The only thing I can really say is don't pretend to be somebody and not because after a while people find out

174
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's pretty much the only advice I can really give

175
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh stay a stab

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000

Later on after this stream I'm going with my family we're gonna go get some corn beef and cabbage at a restaurant

203
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000

I

208
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Can't believe I survived that

209
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000

211
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm trying to like why build something and just die with crit I idiot

212
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000

213
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
At least I think I did oh

214
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
We really what what's doing this well over time you

215
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'll take that oh

216
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000

Eastern time

219
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Do I like streaming on twitch or youtube I think they both have their own little perks

220
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I

221
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
For instance, I think more people can watch a twitch live stream because twitch is available in more areas

222
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
oh

223
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yeah twitch is available more in more places

224
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I think that the reason why people are having problems with this stream is youtube streams are not available

225
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
All over the place in the world

226
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm pretty sure that's the problem people are having

227
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Is there no damage spread on the server?

228
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
How did I not hit him

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000

Help me build this pyro thanks dude

345
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
My opinion on the very controversial subject of bread

346
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Well, obviously bread is an incredibly incredibly controversial subject

347
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I think that the

348
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Best kind of bread is weak bread

349
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But then of course the white bread will get really irritated with that and the rye bread might rise up and take over the

350
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Wheat country of d'Ostaadu so I'm you know, I like to stay pretty neutral

351
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Bam

352
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
My brain just exploded right there. I'm like what am I doing? I thought I was on offense for a second

353
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Where the hell is shibi?

It's at least I could do oh my god. Oh well it looks like we crashed the server

358
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh, don't worry everybody. We have every entrance secure

359
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
All we need is one pointing down the stairs and you're talking about hystericalness

360
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Oh my god, this server is laggy as hell

361
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Oh my god, all right, I'm moving. I'm going down here

362
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm going right here. They don't even know I'm here either

363
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Oh

364
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Skibi they revenge crits. That's all I'm caring about right now. I'll change classes after this

365
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Oh, that's a spy

This new server

389
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Here we are

390
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Everyone head there, hopefully this place doesn't like crash

Yeah, if you're getting the stream error try closing out your browser and like clearing out like your like your browser history like you cash and all that and then try coming back in that seems to have been working for some people

392
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000

There we go

398
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000

I don't think it'll ever happen though

434
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I think they're kind of gonna stick with the community idea thing and let the community run with it and I'm gonna die

435
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I

00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
A weapon I like to see in team fortress is a

451
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
new

452
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Engineer primary that's not a shotgun

453
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I guess they kind of already did that with the Pomsim

454
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But it's still technically a shotgun. I'd like to see a total replacement for the shotgun

455
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Am

456
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'll protect that medic

457
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Damn, I gotta put on I gotta put the uh

458
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So is it true that this works the cozy camper works with the Huntsman?

459
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yeah, that this probably some bug in the youtube streaming right now to be honest because this should not be double ads playing

460
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
That's like that just should not be like happening

461
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Oh

462
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And are you like stuck in an infinite ad?

463
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Infinite ad

464
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Oh, watch it

465
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Ow

466
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
So is it is the stream was it in your sub boxes guys just wondering

467
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Oh, that was sick

468
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Oh

469
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh

470
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Because maybe that's another part of the problem I've I've had a couple people say that it's not it wasn't in the subscription box

471
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Or it should have been oh

472
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Too many people attacking oh not and no I don't know to do

473
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Oh, it is infinite ads are you serious?

474
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Oh

475
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
My god

476
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That's all that this this is just a bug in the youtube streaming definitely

477
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
In fit it ads

478
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Give me a break just just

479
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Reload the screen

480
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I

481
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Is reload the street

482
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yeah, if you're getting if you're getting infinite ads if you get like stuck in an infinite ad just reload the stream

483
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
youtube dot com the best website in the world

484
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Oh

485
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Oh, and anybody can buy the train

486
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Damn it

487
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Damn it I can't see him. He's the flames of blocking him

488
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Oh

489
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah, if you if you're getting infinite ads definitely definitely just reload the stream or like just come back because that's

490
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
That's stupid

491
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
That should absolutely not be happening

492
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Oh add that add then add

493
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
That's so the dumb

494
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Oh

495
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That medic is standing still

496
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I didn't kill the medic

497
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But I kill was weird

498
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Oh

499
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Oh god, oh god, no why why

500
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Are we by any car

501
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
You

502
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Yeah

503
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Just kill can somebody in the stream right uh that if you're getting like an just reload the browser if you're getting an infinite ad like more like two or three of you say it because this the chat is uh

504
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Quite fast

505
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Because I wouldn't want someone to just sit there and like be like what is going on?

506
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I

507
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Got crits

508
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Did that help

509
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
No, no, no, no, get out of the range

510
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
After this run I'm gonna hop into some CS go for a little bit should be interesting

511
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Do

512
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Do

513
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yeah, all the all the things you're seeing are

514
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
YouTube streaming bugs apparently none of this happened last time those of you that were here last time

515
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I i don't think I can restart the stream that's the problem

516
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:37,000
The thing with YouTube is once you start you have to either stop and like remake an event or you can't

517
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I think it's it's weird like that. I've got a crit screen right now. Oh my god

518
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I killed one person

519
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Oh

520
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Infinite ads. Oh my god. Well, I guess the one possibly good thing is this thing will be watchable on YouTube

521
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Hopefully unless there's more bugs

522
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Oh

523
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Wonder why predict oh he's gonna fish kill me. No, he's gonna fish kill me. He's gonna fish kill me

524
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
He fish killed me

525
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Oh

526
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
All right, we'll go with three more deaths and I'm gonna hop on CS go

527
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I'll see if there's something I can do on my end

528
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I don't think there is unless I turn off the stream and then like redo another live event

529
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Which I mean it takes a little while to set these up on YouTube, so

530
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
uh

531
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000

619
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000

00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Think this is coming out in a couple months. Maybe I don't know. There's no release date for it yet. It's in beta

638
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
It's a pp

639
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Check the ppl

640
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
If I get one car for free, I would want the most expensive car you could ever make

641
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I would want like a Lamborghini or like a Bentley

Is this guy camping with a digel?

648
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
How you gonna copy isn't it of this is you have to go to give the take valve survey

649
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
They have like a csgo survey

650
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
All the famas and Kevin Longhom

651
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I've been invited to join the group kill free gaming

652
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000

Boston is good

658
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I like it

659
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
It's kind of cold out here now though

660
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
The survey is if you just type into google type in like

661

I

663
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Think you can do it through steam as well

664
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I mean, maybe they aren't even doing it anymore. I'm not sure if anybody knows

665
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Where's the

666
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,000

667
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Oh

668
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah, they're not even close two totally different games. I'm gonna go this way I have more luck going this way before

669
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000

Resume game

675
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
The beta ends probably when the game comes out

676
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I

677
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Scout asks for a dispenser will you give him one?

678
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Actually the questions were kind of weird

679
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
It was like let me ask you something

680
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,000
What's what does more damage in a round the m4a1 or the ak47 which one do you think is more powerful?

681
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
They ask you to ask you like actual real questions about itself

682
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
That's not how I got into it though. I got somebody gave me a beta key

683
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000

I got a GTX 470 from a video that's the video card I got

944
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000

Kevlar and helmet and a high explosive

946
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Oh, yeah, all right, this probably would be the last round before the I in the stream because I want to go back and look and see what was going on

947
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000

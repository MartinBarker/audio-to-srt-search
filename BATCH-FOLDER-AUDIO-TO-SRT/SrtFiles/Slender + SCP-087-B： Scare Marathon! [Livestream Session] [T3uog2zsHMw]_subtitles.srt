You needed something to fall asleep to Larry. I'm sorry. This is what you have to fall asleep to

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It would be tough if I was you

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Slender and SCP containment breach

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
See it's good to have you guys here in the chat because when I play this game alone if whatever I play like scary games alone

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000

See the bad part about these uh these like SCP and Slender and stuff

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you try to hit escape or get like to a menu or something you just close the game

I gotta get ready for this one

104
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Last time I was stupid and I turned around and looked at him and said hello

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Page one all right, I got to I got to think of a plan of action here before I pick this up

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Where's the page? What the hell?

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay, there's the page one. I'm gonna go straight through here

108
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
No, wait, do I want to go there? Go straight down there. Let's see

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We're gonna go straight down there

110
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Here we go ready go

111
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You can't run you can't hide you can't get away from the man

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So I already here static

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I think I already here's the no idea. Oh great. I think I decided to run into offense now. I'm gonna turn around

114
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He's gonna be right there

115
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Cool great

116
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Hmm

117
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I

118
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Shouldn't ran. That was a dumb idea. I shouldn't have sprinted

119
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, you know what I wish there was a stamina bar somebody said the stamina is like it's hard to read

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I wish there was a bar right there like right on the screen that said all you have like this percentage or this amount

121
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I just walk into circle

122
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Man, I hate this I hate this guy

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Where's like the gun so I can turn around just just unload on his and touch that

124
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Where's that water

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think this water in this game. Oh is that water or static? There's no water

126
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm not looking behind me. I'm not I'm not making that same mistake

127
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
See last time I look behind me that was a massive mistake

128
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What do you guys say? Let's see

129
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Straight jump and you can jump in this game. I don't think you can jump

130
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I thought that was him right there by the way like whatever the hell that is

131
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, we have some moss on the tree. That's painted just like slenderman's body

132
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No, I'm not looking behind me don't ever look behind you

133
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Worst idea

134
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You know what's people to talk about the spy and slenderman think about it. He's in a suit

135
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He has like no face. He's got like a mask on or whatever. I don't maybe maybe it doesn't have a mask on

136
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Tall guy in a suit that gets behind you

137
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Slenderman is a spy

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What I hate being in here get oh

139
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000

I don't even care. Screw that friggin paper. I don't even care

142
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll lose the game. I don't even I don't even want to be in there if I get stuck in there with him

143
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm dead over I'm dead. I'm so dead right now

144
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000

145
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm gonna look him right in his eyes

146
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Run

147
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm gonna spit that out

148
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I was if he jumped at me right there. I would have spit that all of my screen in the stream what I had to like and

149
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Getting stuck on trees now. That's not cool

150
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Probably right behind me and it's gonna make that noise

151
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Move faster you

152
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000

Oh, there's so many things like it say right now. I don't even know what adjective to use

154
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What's what somebody say jerma is lend him and but I don't know I don't even know what that said I'm too scared

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000

156
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
He's probably this asshole is probably gonna be standing right here

157
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I wish I could just take my headphones out of the here this music

158
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000

I'm gonna

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I can't look high surface. I can't look at the screen

164
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh

00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000

Run it as administrator good call good call

345
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Those of you that said that good call because that's probably what's gonna happen. It's what it's gonna work right now

346
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
No, I had I had this work in two I made sure it worked before I started the stream and it worked

347
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Now it's being a real piece crap

348
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000

Again

352
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000

Good looks like I'm gonna have to drink a bunch of doctor pepper that I mean come on

355
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
What if I just like

358
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Just like hurled all over the place

359
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I would I wish I could see something like that I would laugh my absolute

360
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Ass off if I got to see something like that

361
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I do me me me me me

362
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That's so funny

363
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Well, it looks like we're playing contain uh

364
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
The 087 B again, which is my favorite game of all time

365
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
After this I'm gonna play some TF2 so I'll stick around you're not gonna want to miss this

366
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I can't believe I'm well in this game up again. I did not want to play contain

367
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
087 B again. I wanted to play it once and that was it

368
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I didn't want to have to do this damn game more than once

369
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Here we go

370
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It's gonna be like

371
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So hey prepare your ears. I'm one of you guys right now turn your headphones down

372
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Because I gotta catch this if I don't catch it immediately

373
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Then it's gonna be an issue. So we'll give me a minute

374
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Let me make sure the face game's nice and big and the corner there

375
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Here we go

376
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I gotta make sure the mixers here

377
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Wait, wait, why does it say containment breach is in the background hold on a second hold on a second

378
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
One second here

379
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I think the reason why it's screwing up is because

380
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It's like thinks it's running in the background

381
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Oh, whatever. I don't want to waste your guys time anymore. You guys have been patient. Let's do it

382
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You guys have been patient. Let's do it

383
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Here we go

384
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Here we go. I'm just stalling as much as I can here we go. No

385
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Super crate box. That's a great game

386
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Hmm

387
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Don't want to click this button. I don't want to play this game again

388
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But you know what I'm gonna play it again because you have to man up sometimes and do it

389
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So here we go

390
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000

391
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000

398
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That's not happening

399
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Did you see that it just was like it

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
All right fine fine fine. We'll do it again. We'll do it again

401
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000

Something just flashed on the screen like a face just flashed in my face

406
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I looked like the Cheshire cat from house in Wonderland

407
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
What happens if I go down here

408
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Oh

409
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000

410
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Third times the charm guys

411
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I keep leaving

412
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You gotta be kidding me. Oh, be sure you don't like fall out of the hole and die

I'm not gonna do any dumb mistakes and I'm not gonna leave right off the bat

415
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, I know

416
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Pretty sure I pretty sure I know that that's where I am at this point. You don't have to keep telling me

417
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Well, let me get like the dust off my screen because it's making me think that this stuff on there

418
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You are now entering some gauntlet legends you are now entering the crypt of the spider kingdom or something whatever it was

419
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Just keep talking and I won't be scared just keep talking just keep making noises with your mouth and you won't be

420
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
scared about things that are jumping out of you on the screen

421
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You know what man

422
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I am just so sick of you

423
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Why do you have to keep doing that

424
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
What what what what is this what the hell is this why is it what's this

425
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000

Where am I I don't have a flashlight I don't even know where I am

427
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Do I go in there do I go over here I don't know I don't know

428
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Do with one eye if I do it with one eye it's not that bad

429
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I do it with one eye it it still is bad it's still just as bad with one eye forget that

430
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Never mind what I just said it's still just as bad with one eye closed or about both eyes closed

431
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But I get to where I'm going

432
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Things are getting weird looking again things are getting like green and like oh pagan

433
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Oh, this is it I'll get me out of here

434
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I think he's on steps

435
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Stop it

436
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Why

437
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
This is what happened last time and then the thing jumped out of me

438
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Oh

439
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
10

440
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
If you I got to think of a song a nice happy song hold on

441
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Rain drops keep falling on my head

442
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But that don't leave my lives a true video there red

443
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But the server bed

444
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
The rain drops keep falling on my head

445
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
They keep falling

446
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But you're blue deep inside of the heart is bad

447
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't know the lyrics but it's helping lots it just helping lots when no it's not

448
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
No

449
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Just keep

450
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Oh man I hate it bummed down pretty far I didn't get down this far last time

451
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000

452
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000

454
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Damn it man

455
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I

456
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Am I going down further

457
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm not going down further than that

458
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Containment breach

459
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Like that that this game hurts my head wow

460
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Oh

461
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Beatbox the Halloween theme but like the t-tint. All right, I'll do that

462
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I

463
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
As I go

464
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Here we go all right

465
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
See if I can I can do this

466
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Because it's Halloween makes sense right

467
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Most of Halloween right now but it will be

468
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Here we go

469
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Oh

470
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I can't even do it it's too hard I'll slow it down on

471
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Oh

472
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
There we go that was better. I was a little bit better

473
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I tried to do it like way too fast the first time like

474
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It wasn't gonna work

475
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
All right

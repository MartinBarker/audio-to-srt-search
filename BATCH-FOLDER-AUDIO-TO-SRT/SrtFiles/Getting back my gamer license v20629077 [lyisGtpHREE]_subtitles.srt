1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
all

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hey, hey.

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, this early is supposed.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's because this is the bacon and eggs breakfast stream.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I told you, I told you it was going to happen.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Random times.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What a great streamer.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You know, most people when they stream, they're like, they have like you do, if you can

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
get used to their schedule, you get this guy's always live at this particular time.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He's always going to be, no, no, this is, it's 5 a.m. right now.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But what am I doing here right now?

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I should be in bed.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But no, I'm not in bed.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is there a reason why we're streaming at 5 in the morning?

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
No.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Actually, the kind of is, I'm trying to reset my sleep schedule.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And what better way to do that than to get my gamer license back.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Because if you missed the last stream, my gamer license was revoked.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I had guppy and like seven familiars in the binding of Isaac.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And I lost and my gamer license was revoked.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So to get it back, we're going to play Super Meatball.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is an old classic.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I actually, I played through this game on my channel like three years ago.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But I'm just going to chill.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm going to play it.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm going to play Cryptarch too.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We'll see how far I get with this.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I might just do like the first or second chapter and then switch to Cryptarch.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Because that's like a current game.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But I'm going to warm up with some meat, boy.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's been a while.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm going to grab my computer and burning.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I would get a fire extinguisher and spray it.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But we're going to play a couple games to keep me awake.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Start with Meatball.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Warm up a little bit.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A little bit of Cryptarch.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If I complete the forest and into, I'd say like the first two or three chapters, then

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you can, you know, you got your junior license.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll have my Learnage permit.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But without further ado, we're going to get this off the screen.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We all know the story.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I deleted this Blass A file I had here.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So this is completely clean, fresh slate.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We're going to go for A pluses on every single one of these beliefs initial levels.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why don't you put your chat in the stream display?

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Well, I have no idea how to do that.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And just before we get started, I guess we'll address this.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I get a lot of people asking me about, well, I can do these first few levels of brainless.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I get questions all the time about like, what are you going to do this when you're going

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
to do that?

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
When are you going to XYZ?

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Where's this sub button?

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
How can I donate to you?

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Why do you not show ads?

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Your stream sucks.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Where's your overlay?

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Honestly, this like first month or so, trying to like stream a lot more often.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's more so a trial run from me to see how like settings work than anything else.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You know, like, could I do all that stuff?

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But no, I want to make sure like I can actually stream with like a constant bit rate.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm actually going to do that again.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But faith, like stuff like face cam will never, they will never, ever be on this channel.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Your examples came back positive for LSD, cocaine and TCP, but there were no performance

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
enhancing drugs.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, that's good to know.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Shit.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I forgot to say this is supposed to be a non-death playthrough.

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I wouldn't die one time.

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Alright, well how do you, this one's just a big add set.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I've already died too many times here, I think.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm going to find out.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Alright, I think the band-aids.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I've totally forgot about the band-aids in this game.

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh shit.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That was a word.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I can't fuck this up.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Slow down.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm trying to get my gamer license back and not throw it at the trash.

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oops.

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay, you can command a video for this one.

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I actually don't remember.

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh shit.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I didn't even know I forgot about the ones at the top.

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay, I gotta be careful with this.

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Skypup.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, I did it.

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay, there's all kinds of secrets that I forget in this game, but I did that one.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I think there's something else you have to do in there.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Was the Wonder Book video the video that cost your entire bank account? No.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Dude, a Wonder Book.

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
A Wonder Book is like $8 for the Wonder Book and the game.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's not an expensive.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That stuff is so old.

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Wonder Book is like, I really wish we'd see more of it.

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We'd see more of that shit though.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's so cool.

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Whoa, whoa, didn't get an A plus.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Excuse me.

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I also didn't get this.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Fuck.

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No, we're not getting the A plus zero. We get the band-aid.

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now we'll get the A plus.

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's magic for crying out loud.

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What the fuck?

109
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Was it five seconds?

110
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What's the quick restart button? I know it exists.

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Is it select?

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll pick that up.

113
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Nothing I gotta get used to is the Xbox One controller.

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The Xbox One controller is kind of odd because we'll go over this too.

115
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Every single one of the, because I don't use the analog,

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
all the D pads are individual buttons.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So it's kind of odd.

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You know, when you scroll your thumb across the bottom of the Xbox One controller,

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
it's like,

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
it's just kind of feels awkward because I'm pushing my hand over popcorn kernels.

121
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll get used to it though.

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No, that's not gonna, no.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Just try again.

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Here we go.

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
My PlayStation fan, I'm an all game fan.

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I like all games.

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Doesn't matter what it is.

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
All the D pads.

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
All the D pads.

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm gonna get the band-aid on this as well,

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
because you gotta get the band-aid.

132
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh shit, I blew it.

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But if they made like a wonder book for the PS4,

134
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and it's not because just like,

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
oh yeah, I can't wait to make like a video on it.

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That like is actually a very cool concept.

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Shit.

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They made four games for that thing.

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There was an unannounced like,

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
all right, hold on, hold on, hold on.

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let me, let me get this band-aid and we'll talk.

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Fuck you.

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh my god, all right, I gotta stop going on that one.

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's the big, some stake.

145
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh, I did it anyway.

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
All right, fuck it.

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We're not even getting some band-aid.

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'll get it later.

149
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know, we gonna do it again?

150
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That was really sloppy.

151
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I could make that cleaner.

152
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is also really sloppy, but you know,

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
still got it.

154
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I actually like the feel of the Xbox One controller,

155
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
where the buttons are placed and where the analogs are placed.

156
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I could really do without how loud this fucking thing is.

157
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Really like every single one of these buttons,

158
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
it's crazy, like the bumpers, I'm gonna hit,

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm gonna hit a series of buttons

160
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
on this controller and you'll hear it ready.

161
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Like half the buttons on this thing make a really loud annoying noise.

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Especially the bumpers.

163
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Those are so loud.

164
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

165
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I was gonna skip the band-aid for now.

166
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We're going for A-plosses.

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm not catching them now, actually.

168
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I wanna go on the warp zone.

169
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, the steam, that's right, the steam controller did release.

170
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Or kind of, isn't it like, can you use it or something?

171
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Is it a beta or something like that?

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, I sip on coffee.

173
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This is the commander video level, right?

174
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I believe it is, it is.

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, right, okay.

176
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You can like use it when you, okay.

177
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I got it.

178
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Commander Video actually thinks my favorite character in this game.

179
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If I remember.

180
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I must have watched the Super Meat Boy playthrough 15 times.

181
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Well, now you get to see one live.

182
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't know if this is gonna be a playthrough or not.

183
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm just kind of playing just to keep myself awake and warm up my video game skills.

184
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Well, I officiate your bar mitzvah.

185
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't think I have the qualifications to do that.

186
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You know what I mean?

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Like, I don't have, that's a easy bandaid, I'll get it.

188
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, I'm gonna stick the walls in there.

189
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Ooh!

190
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm rushing a little too much.

191
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
How many of these sound effects are using the Isaac?

192
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah, I'd be surprised.

193
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I mean, it is the same team, right?

194
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That was still an A plus.

195
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Wow.

196
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
How many times have I completed this game?

197
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Maybe like three?

198
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Maybe a little bit less than that?

199
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
A little bit, maybe a little bit less than that?

200
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What does that mean?

201
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I completed it maybe two or three times.

202
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh, maybe a little bit, what, like two and a half?

203
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You know what?

204
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, that's, that is true.

205
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's true.

206
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I've completed this game maybe two and a half times.

207
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
One of those playthroughs in particular, not the one that I did on my channel,

208
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
but just in particular, I was really into it super duper ultra into this game.

209
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Was there a bandaid here?

210
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That was a long time ago though.

211
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Not another here.

212
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
When did this game come out?

213
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Whenever the launch of Super Meat Boy was,

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
it was like my favorite game for that like year that it was out.

215
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
2009 does 10.

216
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Am I going to go for all A pluses in the playthrough?

217
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I could try.

218
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's going to be fucking hard though.

219
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What am I doing?

220
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Can you just do this?

221
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't want to get that bandaid because it's really not that hard.

222
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's all about just sitting here.

223
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I could just time it like this.

224
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't have to go fast anymore.

225
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And then I'm going to try to hook on this wall.

226
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And, oh fuck.

227
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Fuck.

228
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Can't get caught up in the game.

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm going to go for all A pluses in the playthrough.

230
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm going to go for all A pluses in the playthrough.

231
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm going to go for all A pluses in the playthrough.

232
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm going to go for all A pluses in the playthrough.

233
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Can't get caught up in the bandaid.

234
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This is an A plus run.

235
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Nothing more, nothing less.

236
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm going to have my chance right there.

237
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Game of Germans gaming license never existed.

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If you do it is TOEFL BOY.

239
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Are any levels even completeable with TOEFL BOY?

240
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I thought that the game was uncompletable if you played with him.

241
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Because he can only jump 5 feet in the air or something.

242
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know.

243
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't know if I can jump 5 feet in the air or something.

244
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
See ya.

245
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Woah.

246
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
My eyes just deceived me right there.

247
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That was weird.

248
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
For some reason I thought I was much lower than I was.

249
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Okay.

250
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Ooh.

251
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
A plus.

252
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Or A.

253
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Berger Boy should be playable in this game.

254
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I agree.

255
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
These aren't that hard to A pluses.

256
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Am I my streaming at 5 a.m. I'm just I don't know.

257
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
We're fun.

258
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
For fun, sake.

259
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Because why not, right?

260
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm gonna jump into squirrels.

261
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Give me that A+.

262
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Because you've lost control of your life.

263
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah, I guess.

264
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Hey, we won.

265
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
No dark world.

266
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Only three bandages.

267
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Two of the four.

268
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Where are the two warps?

269
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I don't remember at all.

270
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I mean, the other two warps there.

271
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh, I don't know what your gold PS4.

272
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't care.

273
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I've heard about the invasion TF2 update.

274
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah, I played it big yesterday.

275
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's pretty good.

276
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It was pretty fun.

277
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I should probably use buy should use commander video for more or less.

278
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh, come on now.

279
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This is not gonna be an A+.

280
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm just gonna walk into the wall because it's not an A+.

281
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah, that's keeps on fucking me up.

282
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Wow.

283
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What am I doing here?

284
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Whoa, I got stuck there.

285
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't know.

286
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't even have to do that.

287
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I can just keep going the whole way.

288
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh, I got too scared.

289
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Still an A+.

290
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Commander video is useless.

291
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah, it's fun to play.

292
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I like being of a float around.

293
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's fun.

294
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It doesn't float around this commander video.

295
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Do I have anything planned for Halloween?

296
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I have a video I want to make for Halloween, but I don't even think it's gonna be possible.

297
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I really don't think it's a possible video to make.

298
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I so badly want to do it though.

299
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It could be so much fun.

300
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Try marking the ninja.

301
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I actually told me that that game is really good.

302
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't remember who it was.

303
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Oh, no, no, I sprayed that up.

304
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm going for speed here.

305
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I sprayed it up again.

306
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's okay.

307
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
No, nothing more.

308
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:16,000
How often do my 30-year-old eyes deceive me all the time?

309
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,000
More than you would think.

310
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Give me the bandaid.

311
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Give me the bandaid.

312
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Give me this thing.

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Stop it.

314
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Thank you.

315
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh, the love of all the bandaid.

316
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't think I had enough.

317
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The best one to book game?

318
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I don't know.

319
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's a good question.

320
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
They're all fun.

321
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
They're all interesting.

322
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I've been over here for a while.

323
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I sprayed it up again.

324
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Just screwing shit up.

325
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't know how we do it around here.

326
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What am I doing wrong here?

327
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'd like to remember just being able to drop down.

328
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah.

329
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Punch game.

330
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
This is one more wonderful to play.

331
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I have no idea how it is.

332
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I feel like it's not going to be that funny, but I've said that before.

333
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And some of the times I've said that.

334
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
End up being like some of my favorite things I've ever recorded.

335
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Like that GTA V, like grab the Auto V, all like the mobile ripoffs.

336
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I really didn't know if I was going to want to make that.

337
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I sat there for a second.

338
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm like, do it.

339
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Is this funny?

340
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Is this, like, what am I doing right now?

341
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Is this worth me doing?

342
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I downloaded like 30 of those games.

343
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Was this the right call?

344
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Should I fucking dump this?

345
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It turns out I was one of my favorite things I've recorded in the last, like,

346
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,000
probably at least six or 12 months.

347
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Do you remember lemme your infinite wisdom in guiding on how to pick up the ladies?

348
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm not sure you know this dude, but I am single.

349
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm currently single right now, man.

350
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I don't know if I can give you the best advice on that.

351
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Fuck the bandits.

352
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
What am I doing?

353
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Get in there!

354
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Get in there!

355
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Get in there!

356
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Get in there!

357
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Get in there!

358
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
How many videos get thrown under the rug only seen by, like, me and Star?

359
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
More than you would probably imagine.

360
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Well, let's put it this way.

361
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
There are a lot of ideas.

362
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And maybe not so much like the videos getting made.

363
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
There's a lot of ideas that I would say get half made in and swept under the rug.

364
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I've made entire videos.

365
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I actually have an entire video that I made that I have never uploaded.

366
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's just sitting there rendered ready for me to upload.

367
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And I'll never release it because I don't like it.

368
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Ooh, that was quick.

369
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I don't know.

370
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I mean, you guys probably noticed this recently.

371
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
The videos have the uploads have slowed down.

372
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And that's mainly because I want to...

373
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I've never already talked about this.

374
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I don't even need to talk about it again.

375
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm turning into a broken record about this.

376
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Long story short, I want to just make the videos that I like to make.

377
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Rather than, you know, I gotta make a video every day.

378
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I have to make a video.

379
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I have to make like four videos a week.

380
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm just...

381
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm back to where I was a few years ago,

382
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
and I was like, you know what?

383
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I like making these videos.

384
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm gonna make a video.

385
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I like making videos.

386
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Mmm, shit.

387
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
There's no time limit on these ones.

388
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
There's no gold to get.

389
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
There's no A plus to get here.

390
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I just want to stay alive here.

391
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Whoa, he came out of nowhere.

392
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Ooh, okay, hold on.

393
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Hold on a second here.

394
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Don't screw this one up.

395
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I got one life left.

396
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Oh, fuck.

397
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Shit, fuck.

398
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Dick.

399
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Every swear you can imagine.

400
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
We gotta go back.

401
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Shit.

402
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I had that too.

403
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I just overreacted.

404
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That was like just a true testament to why you should never overreact in this game.

405
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You know, you probably should be just waiting here.

406
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm trying to remember all the strats.

407
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Wow, I did it again.

408
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Alright, stop talking.

409
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Quiet, quiet that mouth of yours.

410
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm just beat this one.

411
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So we can get out of here.

412
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm gonna get out of here.

413
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm gonna get out of here.

414
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm gonna get out of here.

415
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm gonna get out of here.

416
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Alright, we're skipping this warp zone for now.

417
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
We're gonna come back to it.

418
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I almost salvaged that.

419
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Whoa, what?

420
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Oh, right.

421
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I had to run into warp zone.

422
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh, that's stuck.

423
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Hello.

424
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Yeah, I got I got I got I got canned from the DMV.

425
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I would have loved to have grabbed that when I had the chance to get it.

426
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Oh, you fucker.

427
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Shit, that wasn't cool.

428
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Play it safe.

429
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Just get the bandaid.

430
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I got to make plus out of it.

431
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I wonder who made all the squishy sound effects for this game?

432
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Yeah, you know, that's a question that's on my mind sometimes.

433
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
They call them fully artists, right?

434
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Guys who just pretty much make weird sounds and hit meat with baseball bats and squish up toilet paper with their mouths to make sounds.

435
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
That was an 8 plus.

436
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Excuse me.

437
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I got locked.

438
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,000
My thumb got locked in there.

439
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Oh, I got to die.

440
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm gonna die.

441
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm gonna get over that.

442
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Fuck enough.

443
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Here we go.

444
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Fuck enough, please.

445
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Whoa.

446
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
16 seconds is 8 plus.

447
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I gotta go more fast than that.

448
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Nope.

449
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:50,000
15, 15, 15.

450
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That's why I'm single me in star.

451
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I don't know about that.

452
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Whoa.

453
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I actually just forgot what this level did.

454
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You just go right to the right.

455
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Hey, how I am?

456
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Whoa.

457
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I missed that one.

458
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Oh, I messed up that one.

459
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Big time too.

460
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Fuck.

461
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Fuck.

462
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:07,000
No, I messed up the timing.

463
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'm just walking to the dude.

464
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You gotta go right off the bat.

465
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You gotta go 1, 2, 3.

466
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Boom.

467
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Boom.

468
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
No.

469
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm not.

470
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm alright.

471
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
No, no, no.

472
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm rocking this shit again.

473
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Oh, fuck.

474
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm gonna fucking step on a rake.

475
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm gonna set up a rake in my backyard just so I can step on it.

476
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Like fucking side show Bob and the Simpsons.

477
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Shoot me up.

478
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Oh no.

479
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Whoa.

480
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I didn't get no way.

481
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I got a plus now.

482
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
That's really, really annoying.

483
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
What the hell is that?

484
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
How would I have just gotten an A plus for that?

485
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
That was a C plus at best.

486
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That was like a C minus.

487
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
How high was I when I made the TF2 sound mod?

488
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I didn't make the TF2 sound mod.

489
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,000
That was somebody else.

490
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Hey, hey, alright.

491
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Let's try this again.

492
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Bob, but I was just looking at the chat.

493
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Whoops.

494
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
This one has a specific pattern.

495
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I've just not going to even care about.

496
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I was gonna try to do it on pure skill.

497
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Okay, here we go.

498
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Wait, what is it?

499
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What does somebody say?

500
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Not YouTube because if it is, you must have made like $2 this three months with a rate of uploads

501
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
and the content of it talking about Star and Aunt Jerma.

502
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I mean, you don't have to do something for money.

503
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I mean, like, yeah, you can get paid for something but not do it for money.

504
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Does that make any sense?

505
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:42,000
What I just said.

506
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Like, just because Star or I get paid from our videos doesn't necessarily mean

507
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:59,000
where we like do it to make money.

508
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
There we go.

509
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
What is the boss of chapter two?

510
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I don't even remember.

511
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Oh, it's this guy.

512
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It's Chad.

513
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
There he is.

514
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Hey, did a Chad.

515
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Oh, shit.

516
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Some of these bosses I do forget the pattern zone.

517
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So it's gonna take me into your couple of different areas.

518
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's gonna take me like quite a few times, probably here.

519
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Shit.

520
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Oh, I got locked out of that one.

521
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Oh, you fucker.

522
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Damn it.

523
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Going too fast.

524
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Can you, you know, there are no a fuss on boss.

525
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
What am I doing?

526
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Ah, I already do it.

527
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Going for like 8 pluses and they don't even exist.

528
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Oh, here.

529
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Okay.

530
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Is this gonna be the first small wall that I hit?

531
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You fucking.

532
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Can I get up to the other side without having to do all that?

533
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I don't think I can.

534
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Oh, shit.

535
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I blew it already.

536
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Damn.

537
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
First fast, I just did the first one.

538
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
This is taking me a little longer.

539
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Just gonna make it.

540
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I do that a lot in this game.

541
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I will say.

542
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:26,000
There we go.

543
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm going to need a new game.

544
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I think a lot of people do it.

545
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You go through phases.

546
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Sometimes you go through phases where you are having a ton of fun playing a one particular game.

547
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And it's all you really care about.

548
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The only thing you want to do is the only thing you want to play.

549
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You just need something else.

550
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I mean.

551
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
There's no reason to rush into trying to find something that you are interested in.

552
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah, I skipped that.

553
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I don't want to say I like to put you in.

554
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
This is where the 8 pluses might start stopping.

555
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I can only guarantee 8 pluses on the first two worlds really.

556
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Maybe 3.

557
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Oh, shit.

558
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Oh, shawty.

559
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
This one is...

560
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I can do this one.

561
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Shit.

562
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Give me that key.

563
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I need a key.

564
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Yeah.

565
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah, this is the chapter where people get really shawty.

566
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I wonder how many people like I'll have a good one stream this game and gotten really shawty.

567
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Oh, I like it.

568
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I can already feel my blood boilers getting really shawty.

569
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Now just get me.

570
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Oh, I thought that was going the other way.

571
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I've said that I'm noticing.

572
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
What's with the snake thing?

573
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I've seen it all over Twitch lately.

574
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
People are doing snake noises in a shit.

575
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
What is the snakes?

576
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Does everybody keep pulling up the speed here with the internet stuff?

577
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah, see that guy right there was just like, HISS.

578
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It's like snakes like invading Twitch TV.

579
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh, it's like a guy.

580
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Oh, Twitch has been invaded by fucking snakes.

581
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Oh, geez. What have I done?

582
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah, I just don't know where things originate sometimes.

583
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Now this one's not an A plus.

584
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I can tell you that right now.

585
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Okay, it is.

586
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
You shouldn't have mentioned it.

587
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Well, I don't care.

588
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Stuff like that doesn't really like, doesn't like bother me.

589
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
If you want to be like a fucking snake man on Twitch or whatever,

590
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
you know, you do you.

591
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Did I get an A plus there?

592
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
No, I didn't.

593
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I did not.

594
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I did not.

595
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I did not.

596
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Got it. We got to go fix that.

597
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
We have to wait to fix that.

598
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Here we go.

599
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Whoops on.

600
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Oh fuck.

601
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I'm not gonna go all the way down on this one like that.

602
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
No, not even like that.

603
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Alright, what the hell am I doing wrong here?

604
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Apparently that.

605
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I don't know why I thought that this level went down.

606
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I don't know why I'm trying to jump either.

607
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
This is the eye, hey, hey, this is probably the stream as you get all salty.

608
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I've seen it before.

609
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Does jumping off of this jumping off that doesn't do anything does it?

610
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Maybe it does.

611
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
These make the mechanics of some of this shit.

612
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I don't even remember.

613
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
There we go.

614
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Oh fuck.

615
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Yeah, this one's hurting my head.

616
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I like, you have to go all the way down with it.

617
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
But, oh hey, no more A pluses guys.

618
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
That's the end of the A plus run.

619
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
No, I get it now.

620
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I get it.

621
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm just not hitting it at the right spot.

622
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I gotta go a little further down on it like here.

623
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Nope.

624
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Oh, wait a minute.

625
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Okay, there we go.

626
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You just have to touch the bottom.

627
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
That's really how there is to it.

628
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I can just get a little bit salty, yeah guys.

629
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
That, did you see the thing that just hit me right there?

630
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
A little bit of fucking sordid and potassium chloride.

631
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
My first stream, I don't know what did I play on my first stream.

632
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Oh fucking shut up.

633
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Nope, this got me.

634
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
That first one was really good.

635
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I kind of blew it.

636
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I could have had it in the first one.

637
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

638
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
What did I do that first time?

639
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
What the hell did I, what did I change that first time?

640
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I'm getting a little bit too sharp.

641
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
What did I do?

642
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Alright, let me look, I was pinning into that.

643
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It was binding of Isaac, wasn't it?

644
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
He could have been.

645
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I could see that.

646
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Oh come on, hit the wall.

647
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
We call that dog shit, guys.

648
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Hit the wall, you dog shit.

649
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
What like no vocabulary stuff we must have?

650
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Hit the wall, you dog shit.

651
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
That's a person that doesn't have a whole lot of like weathered vocabulary.

652
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I do, I'm a linguist.

653
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I know my dictionary words.

654
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I hate these things.

655
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
You want to know like, okay, so everybody has like the, the, the, the band of their existence in me, boy.

656
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Mine are these stupid rockets.

657
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I fucking hate these rockets.

658
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Really messing with my A plus run.

659
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Really making me a little bit, what's that word?

660
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I forget it.

661
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You know, I'm not, I'm not a linguist.

662
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
What's that word?

663
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Little two peppery.

664
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Little two, you know, garlic powder.

665
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:59,000
He's getting real garlic powdery.

666
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
What am I doing? Fuck you.

667
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
God.

668
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Down there please.

669
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Don't got all day, we'll go.

670
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Okay.

671
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:29,000
What?

672
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Ten of, what was that?

673
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Maybe I should, I think I should just fall right down, right?

674
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Let's see. Yeah, I'm wasting too much time there.

675
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I gotta go straight down.

676
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Dude, is that vanilla extract?

677
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,000
No, you dummy.

678
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Toot from me, I can induce rage in anyone.

679
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Especially if you're trying to do all 100% A plus.

680
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:15,000
There we go.

681
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Oh, I did, that didn't register.

682
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Control is broken.

683
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Control is fucking broken.

684
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I can't wait to see this.

685
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Did you see that streamer rage on Super Meat Boy?

686
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
He threw his controller into the ground and it exploded.

687
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Oh my god, I can't, it's gonna be everywhere.

688
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Did you see that streamer?

689
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
That was really mad and rage.

690
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Fuck.

691
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I'm so in the, almost a guaranteed A plus.

692
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:13,000
As long as you just write when that thing ends, you hit it.

693
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Burger Boy's sunny day is a video that will never be released.

694
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Ever.

695
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Whoa, what the fuck happened there?

696
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
That was odd.

697
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Can't you just bypass that?

698
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
No, I guess you have to wait.

699
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I hate waiters.

700
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
They come over.

701
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
They try to take your order and shit.

702
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And you're like, excuse me, I'm here on a lunch date.

703
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Come back later.

704
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
But please bring more bread.

705
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Idiot.

706
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
He gives you that waiter look, you know, the like.

707
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I don't even refill your Coke.

708
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I don't even refill your Pepsi in shit.

709
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Where are you?

710
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I'm doing this one wrong for the A plus.

711
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I gotta go on the other side, I think.

712
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Like over here.

713
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Oh, farting my fucking mouth.

714
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:31,000
He's still got it.

715
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:41,000
No, I hate that.

716
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Why must it do that sometimes to me?

717
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Oops.

718
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Dude, did you guys see that whiny, whiny streamer like that?

719
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I do, I hate that whiny streamer.

720
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I can play Super Meat Boy.

721
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
What a whiner.

722
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
It's gonna be on the front page of our slash winers.

723
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Let me through.

724
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:31,000
No, it did it again, whiner.

725
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Rip it.

726
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I'm gonna fart, we got frogs taking over now.

727
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Now, guys, I don't want to be, uh, you know,

728
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
the waiter about this, but frogs.

729
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I mean, come on, let me take over.

730
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Frogs wanted to take over with Twitch.

731
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I think I'd be okay with frogs.

732
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I mean, who really, who wouldn't be okay with a frog taking over.

733
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Especially if they were giant bull frogs.

734
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Ah shit.

735
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Oh, you dumber.

736
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Dumber.

737
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I'm gonna be begging up a random insults for myself this whole time,

738
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:29,000
so I apologize about that.

739
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Unclog the frog, permit the curve.

740
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I've never heard of these before.

741
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Hey guys, look up where at my least favorite thing in this whole game.

742
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Our slash slash, our slash wine, slash whiner.

743
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Ooh, I blew it.

744
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Look at how much I just blew that.

745
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,000
You blew it, you know.

746
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Ha.

747
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
This is where my A plus streak ends.

748
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Nah, you know, I thought about it.

749
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I thought I was gonna end.

750
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's going to end.

751
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Let's just put that one.

752
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I don't know when, but it will.

753
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Maybe around like World 4 or something.

754
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Oh shit.

755
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Oh, gaga, gaga, gaga, gaga.

756
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:03,000
You know, I don't want to get myself angry here and say this is a shot with a snow level.

757
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You know, I don't be mad about everyone on the angry streamers.

758
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
They get on the front page.

759
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Alright, I'd like that way too much and he's like stop doing that.

760
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Hey, look, all the A pluses did it.

761
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Hooray, let's beat the snowman.

762
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Skip.

763
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
That was a bit of race.

764
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Am I crazy?

765
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Hold on, am I insane or did he just go way faster than he's supposed to?

766
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Am I crazy, right?

767
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I thought you were supposed to race this guy.

768
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
He's already done.

769
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
What?

770
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Look, what the fuck is this guy doing?

771
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
He's coming so fast. He's like times two speed.

772
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I'm the cover's supposed to beat him.

773
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Is he going to get stuck at the end or something?

774
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
That's not fair.

775
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Where's my like, drugs to take to go that fast?

776
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I beat him.

777
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'll take it.

778
00:55:45,000 --> 00:56:03,000
On to chapter four, I guess.

779
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Has anybody ever seen that before?

780
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Because in like the three or four times that I've played or watched people play that part?

781
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I've probably seen that done a lot.

782
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I've never ever...

783
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I'm just going to pretend like I beat that fair and square.

784
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
We're not going for warp zones.

785
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
We're not going for all A pluses.

786
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
As fast as possible.

787
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I've got my splits here.

788
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And I am on world record pace.

789
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Yeah, right.

790
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
We're going up there.

791
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I might make one of these going up there.

792
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:05,000
No, no, no, no, you're going to go on it.

793
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Shit, need more speed.

794
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Is it where the A pluses stop?

795
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Jessica.

796
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
AT double hockey sticks.

797
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I love that terminology.

798
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I hate fuck.

799
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Bring me my coke refill.

800
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I got too impatient.

801
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
But that is how you're supposed to beat that.

802
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
You need to just make that jump.

803
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Let's go.

804
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:15,000
This is a floater.

805
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Oh, this is a wordless.

806
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
It's one of those floaters, guys.

807
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Damn it.

808
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Still got him.

809
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Did that incorrectly?

810
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I did it correctly at the beginning.

811
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
But then the fire guy hit me.

812
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:49,000
How?

813
00:58:49,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Oh, my goodness.

814
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Oh, my god, wait.

815
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Again, I have to wait for a waiter.

816
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
You know how fast I want to go?

817
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I don't want to have to wait for this shit.

818
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:25,000
No, it's getting in my head.

819
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Always the damn waiter levels.

820
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
You know what?

821
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I just did the thing where I turned my neck sideways to crack my neck because I'm getting mad.

822
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:51,000
See?

823
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Look, the hair is a thing.

824
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
If it's a waiting level, what is happening to my voice?

825
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Whoa.

826
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,000
If it's a waiter level, it's going to be an A plus as long as you get there by the time the platform has to be there.

827
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
That's how those work.

828
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
So I don't need to rush it.

829
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Like this one.

830
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Just got to stand here.

831
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Yeah, I got to get some more bacon and eggs in me.

832
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Why did I think that that was going to work?

833
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Damn it.

834
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Now I slipped the helmet.

835
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:03,000
How many seconds do I need to shave off of that?

836
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
A huge amount.

837
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
An absolutely massive amount of time has to be shaved off.

838
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That's got to be right there.

839
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Can I do that though?

840
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I wonder if it's as impossible.

841
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Maybe it's not.

842
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Let me shave like three full seconds off.

843
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Yeah, I could shave two seconds out there.

844
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Thought you was switching games after World 2.

845
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I was until here, what's going to happen?

846
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Once I stop reliably getting A pluses within like 10 to 20 attempts on a level, that's when we're going to switch game.

847
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Oh shit, I fucked that up.

848
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Shit, I fucked that up again.

849
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I'll hold on a little bit.

850
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Oh shit.

851
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Oh, that jump.

852
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Good morning.

853
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Need more speed.

854
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,000
You always need more speed than before.

855
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I should have grabbed onto the wall.

856
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
That was a mistake.

857
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
No, I went too fast that time.

858
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Maybe not fast enough.

859
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I gotta get up there when I'm doing two jumps.

860
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
That's really important.

861
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
That has to happen.

862
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
That was like four jumps.

863
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Is there a meepoid drinking game?

864
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Probably.

865
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Oh, that was it too.

866
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I was too psycho about it.

867
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Am I going to watch the Overwatch beta stream?

868
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Holy shit, yeah.

869
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I can't wait for that.

870
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I just want to play the game again, man.

871
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I just want to play Overwatch again.

872
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,000
That's so easy to get.

873
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I like half to just get it.

874
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I'll get it.

875
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Just hold on.

876
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I never chill out.

877
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Everybody gets chill out.

878
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Yeah, you missed it.

879
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I better not see any yellow bells in that chat.

880
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,000
If I missed this again, I swear to God if I see a fucking goddamn yellow well.

881
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Fuck the band-aid.

882
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
What's going on?

883
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I'm seeing yellow bells in the chat.

884
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Unbelievable.

885
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Unbelievable.

886
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Unbelievable.

887
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Unbelievable.

888
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Unbelievable.

889
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Unbelievable.

890
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Unbelievable.

891
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Unbelievable.

892
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I figured I'd do this one.

893
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Pick it up!

894
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Pick up the...

895
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
See if I did that right.

896
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
That would have been fine.

897
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Yeah, I didn't even get it.

898
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
You got it.

899
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
You get it.

900
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Angry streamer.

901
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
You guys are so angry.

902
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Somebody get this guy like a towel to wipe the sweat off of his forehead.

903
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Oh, fuck.

904
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Get it again.

905
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Hey, look what's in this level, guys.

906
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
What is that?

907
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
What is that platform?

908
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Waiting.

909
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And then I get all thrown off and I can't do the next part.

910
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Waiter.

911
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Remind the check.

912
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I'm going to fucking McDonald's.

913
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
What's this dog food that you are serving us?

914
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Whoa, that's what that did.

915
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:50,000
You know, that's what that did.

916
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I'm going to get a coffee soon.

917
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I could, you know, I got a coffee already.

918
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I'm good, man.

919
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Appreciate it, though.

920
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Appreciate the off.

921
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Fuck.

922
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I think I'm doing something a little bit wrong.

923
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
What am I doing wrong, though?

924
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:40,000
You have to go super fast.

925
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I'm taking too much time to do it.

926
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Getting ready for school.

927
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Make sure you're not late.

928
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I don't want you to have watched this movie late to go to school.

929
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Whoops.

930
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I just ran over the whole thing.

931
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Sorry, man.

932
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
This one you got to do the jump.

933
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
You don't want to land on that thing.

934
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Try to remember.

935
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I'm not going fast enough.

936
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Wendy's Big Mac, Big Double Mac.

937
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
What?

938
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
You don't want to Wendy's Big Mac, Big Double Mac,

939
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I don't know how I remember that.

940
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
That was fun.

941
01:08:48,000 --> 01:09:00,000
That was another fun video.

942
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Wendy's Double Mac, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Double.

943
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Yeah, that is something that was stated.

944
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I wish there were more fun games like that to play with your buddies.

945
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:26,000
That was a real good buddy game.

946
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Fuck, I just forgot everything I was doing.

947
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Hello.

948
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Just saying hello randomly.

949
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
No, just kill me.

950
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I already screwed up.

951
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:04,000
You wish you didn't know about that secret strategy.

952
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
You guys didn't know about that secret strategy.

953
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Did you?

954
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Check this one out.

955
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
See that?

956
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Won't hit you there.

957
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:22,000
That's just secret tips and strategies with me.

958
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I forgot this one.

959
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I have to go back.

960
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I have to run back down.

961
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Yeah, I do.

962
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,000
No, I don't.

963
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Maybe I do.

964
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Let me really look at this one.

965
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
You have to be up there.

966
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
And then you go down like that.

967
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,000
It's been a while.

968
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Fuck, I guess not.

969
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Can I just slide back down if I really want to?

970
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I don't even know how to do this.

971
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Again, we're at a waiter.

972
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Back and forward maybe.

973
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Huh.

974
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Well, I like blue through the entire game.

975
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And now I like, I don't know how to beat this level.

976
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Even without April.

977
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I don't even know how to beat the level.

978
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Like, how do you even beat this level?

979
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
It's taken me an hour to get through like four and a half chapters in this entire game.

980
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
But, A pluses, I don't know how to complete this.

981
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:26,000
They use one of the bottom ones to block or something.

982
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Shit.

983
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Oh, wow.

984
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:26,000
To beat this level, walk into the forest and eat the first mushroom you see.

985
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Fuck you.

986
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I did not think I was going to hit a wall where I couldn't complete a level.

987
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I beat this game like fucking 20 times.

988
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Fuck you. That's what you do.

989
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Do you know how many times I beat this game? 20 times.

990
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Now that motherfucker keeps hitting me.

991
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Jesus.

992
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Oh, I know I fucking figured it out.

993
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Definitely long enough.

994
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Will you fuck off left eyeball?

995
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Just fuck right the fuck off.

996
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
You know what I'm saying?

997
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Fucking seriously.

998
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I'm going to get through this level and an A plus the rest of this world in less than ten minutes.

999
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Is he stupid fucking dumbass levels that like have like all this fucking shit that spits blew out of their eyes?

1000
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
You know what I mean?

1001
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Get me on that fucking front page of our rage dreamer. I'm going to get on there.

1002
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:34,000
It's like the hardest level in the whole game.

1003
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Let's continue. Let me get an A plus right now.

1004
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Watch me get this A plus.

1005
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Watch it right here. This is going to be watch this A plus guy.

1006
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I just actually like forgot what the fuck I got.

1007
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I didn't even know what that level just did.

1008
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Fucking dumbass saw blades.

1009
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Not going to take nearly as many tries.

1010
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
What just happened?

1011
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Alright, we're changing games after this. I'm about to flip out.

1012
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
You want to see somebody freak out?

1013
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Oh god, it was a freak out.

1014
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Fucking waiter level.

1015
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
At least I'm going to beat the waiter level in the first try.

1016
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Oh dear fuck.

1017
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:14,000
That's what I give opening my mouth.

1018
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:48,000
First try.

1019
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Those dodges.

1020
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Let's remember what the level is before we try to do it.

1021
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
There's another part to this one too.

1022
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:18,000
If I remember correctly.

1023
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I just get confused.

1024
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I can't do this one fast. What's the timer on this one?

1025
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I bet if this one's probably like a minute.

1026
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
No, 22 seconds.

1027
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:36,000
This is not like an 8 second one.

1028
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I'm just getting stuck on walls.

1029
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:54,000
You sticky skinless fuck.

1030
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Should I be able to jump from that or I'm just hitting the top of the wall?

1031
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:16,000
No, no, there that goes.

1032
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I'm just not doing it.

1033
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Whoa, I fell off.

1034
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I guess I do.

1035
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
No, you just got to go.

1036
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
All right, now I know you can jump underneath them now.

1037
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I'm switching to crib talk after this.

1038
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I know this is never going to end well for me.

1039
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I'm just going to get so mad.

1040
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I'm going to start breaking things in this room.

1041
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I'm just going to run in circles.

1042
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:16,000
No, I'm not doing this one right.

1043
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Wait a minute. Am I going too fast?

1044
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I think I'm just going too fast to be able to complete this one.

1045
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Let's see.

1046
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Let's find out.

1047
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Yeah, I think I have to wait longer, don't I?

1048
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I'll just wait till these dogs go over the top of this then.

1049
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Yeah.

1050
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Well, shit.

1051
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:04,000
That's not cool.

1052
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Maybe another cycle?

1053
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Like one?

1054
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Two, that would be one cycle there, right?

1055
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
No, that was not a full cycle.

1056
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
It was like a half cycle.

1057
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
One, two.

1058
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:40,000
No, I'm going to wait again.

1059
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:48,000
One, two, three.

1060
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Fuckin' have to wait around.

1061
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:06,000
I feel like that's not correct.

1062
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I think you just have to go faster through this.

1063
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Not this one in particular, but the other one.

1064
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Right when I get in here.

1065
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
There we go.

1066
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I had it all wrong.

1067
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
You kidding me right now. You have to be kidding me.

1068
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Give me like one second of teleport immunity.

1069
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Please.

1070
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Can I please get that like half second of teleport immunity?

1071
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:54,000
What a pain in the dick.

1072
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
That is such a pain in the balls.

1073
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:04,000
It really is.

1074
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
If only there was like a quarter of a tenth of a second of teleportation immunity.

1075
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:20,000
That shit wouldn't happen.

1076
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Alright, get it.

1077
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Look at all those meepoys.

1078
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Alright, let's go.

1079
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Don't kill me. Please don't kill me.

1080
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Oh, right. I forgot he does that.

1081
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Yes, he does that.

1082
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:54,000
This is a pattern I have to remembrize.

1083
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Is it again on the other side?

1084
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:04,000
No, that's not my end up.

1085
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Bang.

1086
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
And then he goes crazy and hits like a couple of times.

1087
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Oh fuck, can I use smashers as face?

1088
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Smash your face down and then he does like one, two, three, four with his fists.

1089
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,000
It's like left, left, middle, middle or something.

1090
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Left, right, middle, middle.

1091
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Yeah, left, right, and then he goes in the middle.

1092
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
And then he does it again.

1093
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Wait, too early, but it's okay.

1094
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
First, Jarmistry, welcome.

1095
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,000
How are you doing, man?

1096
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
It's an easy pattern you have to jump three times, you know, those are the same.

1097
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Yeah, I just have, remember, it's been like a year.

1098
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:06,000
So, oh my god, I'm too busy looking and talking and not even paying attention.

1099
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:18,000
The last time I played this game was the last time you watched me play it on my YouTube channel three years ago.

1100
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I'll do it, go ahead.

1101
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And then again, side is a little bit left.

1102
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Do the right, I know, this smashers face again.

1103
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Fuck, it's so easy, but you just have to memorize it.

1104
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Trial and error memorization.

1105
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:04,000
That was just on such a stupid spot.

1106
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:16,000
And please drop the fire right in the middle where I want to stand.

1107
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
It'll be great.

1108
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
There you go, thanks.

1109
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Thank you for doing it.

1110
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
You're dingus.

1111
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Oh, I thought he smashed his face.

1112
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
He smashed his face up to doing it one time.

1113
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Well, I'm going to change the cryptarch after this, because this is like,

1114
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
there's two more chapters after this, but, you know.

1115
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I kind of want to switch.

1116
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I seriously was just sitting there just blanking.

1117
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I was sitting there just like zoned out.

1118
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I was thinking about like breakfast sausage.

1119
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I honestly was sitting there going, you know, you know what's going to be really out there after like breakfast sausages.

1120
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I don't even need to move.

1121
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Nice, matches his face again.

1122
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Right now, don't pay, stop paying attention to the sausages.

1123
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Pay attention to the game.

1124
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I think this is a safe spot.

1125
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Which hand comes down, I forget.

1126
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
What's that one?

1127
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Oh my god, he does it two times in a row.

1128
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Fucking memorizing shit.

1129
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage.

1130
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
And that sound like good right now.

1131
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Other than like, rememorizing a boss fight in a meat boy.

1132
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Did you have him done it three years?

1133
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Go for it.

1134
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Might be in some trouble here.

1135
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Do it again.

1136
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Why am I moving?

1137
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I don't need to move.

1138
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I didn't need to move there.

1139
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I just don't care at all about this right now.

1140
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I always hated this boss.

1141
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I hate this boss because it's so slow and you just have to sit here and like you just get bored.

1142
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And by the time you know what he's doing.

1143
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I'm just like, why is he a big meat boy?

1144
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
That's not fair.

1145
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I want to be the big one.

1146
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Do it again.

1147
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And smash your fucking head again.

1148
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Please end the end the end.

1149
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Please end the end.

1150
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Thank you.

1151
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
All right.

1152
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I gotta use the force.

1153
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
The rapture.

1154
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Size doesn't matter.

1155
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:56,000
This is one more rapture at the end.

1156
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I don't remember.

1157
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I'm gonna get A plus on this first one.

1158
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I'm gonna do it with command or video.

1159
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
That's how I get my gamer license back.

1160
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I have to A plus one of these levels with command or video.

1161
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
That's not gonna be an A plus.

1162
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
In fact, I think some of these videos, some of these videos.

1163
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Some of these I think are not possible to beat with command or video.

1164
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Because he doesn't go fast enough.

1165
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Let's see.

1166
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Why am I forgetting how to do this?

1167
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
22 seconds.

1168
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
How long is that?

1169
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
How slow am I moving with this guy?

1170
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Oh, it was right there.

1171
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
That was the issue.

1172
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Get that right the first time and I'll have it.

1173
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Yeah, definitely.

1174
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Let's do that again.

1175
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Command or video.

1176
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I can go...

1177
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I don't think I've ever unlocked

1178
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
the 70 plus characters.

1179
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I was a little sloppy, but whatever.

1180
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Yeah, I'm gonna start over. That was sloppy.

1181
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Ooh, whoops, it ain't easy.

1182
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I wanted to grab and jump, not float.

1183
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Fucking...

1184
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Gonna crush up fucking glass and put it in my cereal.

1185
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Actually, you know what? Probably...

1186
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,000
See, that with Meat Boy is like the easiest jump you could ever do.

1187
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
You just go right through it.

1188
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Sorry, I'm gonna start over again.

1189
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Command or video.

1190
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Oh, my god. What am I doing?

1191
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Just do three of those.

1192
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I got it.

1193
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
I got it.

1194
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I got it.

1195
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I got it.

1196
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I got it.

1197
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I got it.

1198
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I got it.

1199
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Oh, my god. What am I doing?

1200
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Just do three of those.

1201
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
I got it.

1202
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Dog.

1203
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Shhh.

1204
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I got it.

1205
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I got it.

1206
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I got it.

1207
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I got it.

1208
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I got it.

1209
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I got it.

1210
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I got it.

1211
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I got it.

1212
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I got it.

1213
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I got it.

1214
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I got it.

1215
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I didn't want to do that.

1216
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Like a name like 10 things you didn't want to do in your life.

1217
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Floating right there as Command or Video is one of them.

1218
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Two slow.

1219
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Two slow.

1220
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I remember when I played this game the first time.

1221
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Just trying to beat these level up.

1222
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Still two slow. But why am I still that slow right now?

1223
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I haven't nothing has changed.

1224
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
I'm still getting this one.

1225
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Oh, come on.

1226
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Please.

1227
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Apparently you didn't want to float that time.

1228
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
You didn't want to float that time.

1229
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
What the fuck are you doing Commander Video?

1230
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Please, and all that is sacred.

1231
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
What the fuck are you doing?

1232
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Go.

1233
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Don't float this time.

1234
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I would have had it.

1235
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I thought I was going to miss the time.

1236
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
I really did.

1237
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I really, really did.

1238
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I honestly thought I was going to get it.

1239
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I was definitely going to make the time though.

1240
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
So it'll happen right now.

1241
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I had like three extra seconds.

1242
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I thought I only had like one.

1243
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Yay!

1244
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I can't believe you've done this.

1245
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
All right, last, I just need a matter what happens here.

1246
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
This is the final thing I'm doing.

1247
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Last time.

1248
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
After this one.

1249
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
This is the last thing no matter what happens.

1250
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
This is the last life.

1251
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
All right.

1252
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Do I get, but I A plus every meat boy is level into the rapture.

1253
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
And I want to play Cripp Talk.

1254
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Do I have my Learners permanent back?

1255
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Do I get to do the actual like the driving test in like a week or two?

1256
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:51,000
You said last one a whole chapter ago.

1257
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
What kind of freak is even up at this hour if any purpose other than eating sausage?

1258
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
That's a good question.

1259
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
That's a really good question.

1260
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I'm going to change my stream title to

1261
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,000
a Rick dark.

1262
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,000
That's a lot of Cripp Talk.

1263
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Set up a straw poll for what?

1264
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
What are we doing in a straw poll for?

1265
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
That's what we're doing.

1266
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I need to throw away a carry rebirth run.

1267
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
I did. That's why we have to get our gaming license back.

1268
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Permit the Cermit.

1269
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,000
I got my Cermit Learners permanent.

1270
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Let me get a Cripp Talk open.

1271
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Let's go ahead and open that.

1272
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,000
I got to the Cripp Talk.

1273
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I got to the end of this game.

1274
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I got a really crazy awful generation.

1275
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I lost.

1276
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I'm just chilling.

1277
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I'm going to do dumb builds.

1278
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I don't even care if I lose or not.

1279
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:07,000
You might even try the controller too to test it out and see how it is.

1280
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
What the fuck was that?

1281
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:15,000
What are these weird animals?

1282
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Animals always outside making weird noises.

1283
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Hold on a second.

1284
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I need to see what Turkey or something is outside.

1285
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1286
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1287
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1288
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1289
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1290
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1291
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1292
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1293
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1294
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1295
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1296
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1297
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1298
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1299
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1300
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1301
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1302
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1303
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1304
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1305
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1306
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1307
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I'm going to do a little bit of it.

1308
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Okay.

1309
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
That was weird.

1310
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
I heard a bunch of weird animal noises outside.

1311
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,000
I hear those a lot here.

1312
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Then I wouldn't got my dog.

1313
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Let's change it to this.

1314
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Let's play Cryptarch.

1315
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:49,000
It's a cap of the shit out of Jerma.

1316
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,000
What?

1317
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Cap of him?

1318
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Get him.

1319
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Let's get him.

1320
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I don't get it.

1321
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
You're going to cap of me?

1322
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Why would you do such a thing?

1323
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:15,000
I'm going to do this to the easy stuff.

1324
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:23,000
I'm just going to do the easy stuff.

1325
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Cap of.

1326
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Imagine being that guy.

1327
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Your entire face is a timeless internet thing.

1328
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I don't know how you go.

1329
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
You always go zip gun.

1330
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
No, it's like the first level.

1331
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
It's not even necessary.

1332
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,000
It's going to go to the regular machine gun.

1333
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
No ramp spike.

1334
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,000
You go with just this standard blaster.

1335
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Oh, mouse war now works by the way.

1336
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,000
What's green with the help?

1337
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Black screen.

1338
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
What?

1339
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
What?

1340
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
That doesn't make any sense.

1341
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Why would that?

1342
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Oh god, I figured it out.

1343
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Hold on.

1344
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,000
We got to add this.

1345
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Thought I added this already.

1346
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Apparently not.

1347
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Apparently not.

1348
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Now we're back.

1349
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Now you can see.

1350
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I broke something.

1351
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,000
But anyways, mouse war wasn't working for me before.

1352
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
It is now.

1353
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I can actually use grenades.

1354
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
They're not up to hit F.

1355
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Which was a pain in the butt.

1356
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I'm okay with this.

1357
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,000
In fact, I don't even need this many grenades.

1358
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Load up max 100k.

1359
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
No supply pods.

1360
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
That sounds easy enough.

1361
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I think one of these down to probably.

1362
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Sounds good to me.

1363
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
All right.

1364
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
What are we working with?

1365
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Got shield here.

1366
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Alarm system there.

1367
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
And then cord to destroy.

1368
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:52,000
This is cryptarch by the way.

1369
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Bound you shield the mouse for and you second.

1370
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
That's actually not a bad idea.

1371
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
I might try that in a minute.

1372
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
We'll see.

1373
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I'm just going to go in this way.

1374
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I'm going to take the alarm system out.

1375
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I'm going to go right up the bat.

1376
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Get a couple tech upgrades.

1377
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Get a couple keys.

1378
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
And destroy this.

1379
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
But I cannot, if I want to get the bonus,

1380
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
as I can't take any supply pods.

1381
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I'm going to go right down to the top right.

1382
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
And something I didn't know you can actually put waypoints.

1383
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
If you click did not know that at all.

1384
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Last time.

1385
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Let's go.

1386
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Cryptarch.

1387
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Right in the door here.

1388
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Let's get it.

1389
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Now I can very effectively.

1390
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
That does work.

1391
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Look at that.

1392
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
You can actually block the shield.

1393
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Can't you?

1394
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
You know, it's triggerly alarm.

1395
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
If you do that.

1396
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Something I didn't know before.

1397
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Remember the last time I played this,

1398
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,000
well, I sort of sort of do now.

1399
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,000
He's a term very loosely.

1400
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Auto cannon.

1401
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Okay, that's one of the best items in the game.

1402
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:34,000
What are we going next week to go down right here?

1403
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Yeah.

1404
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I think I got too many grenades too for the first level.

1405
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Maybe.

1406
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Away from me.

1407
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Oh fuck.

1408
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Green slime screwed my head there.

1409
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Is there anything else I want to do here?

1410
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Go that way.

1411
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Grab the tech.

1412
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Why do I never play nuclear throne?

1413
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I don't know.

1414
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
It's just to...

1415
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,000
I never really appealed to me very much.

1416
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I thought it was cool concept, but back when I, oh boy, hold on.

1417
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I got to pay attention here.

1418
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
These enemies are awful.

1419
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
They just shoot back.

1420
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
They blow your stuff in random directions.

1421
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Trench gun.

1422
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Good.

1423
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,000
The game was very early when I first got like a chance to see it.

1424
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
They've been doing a ton of updates to it.

1425
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
It's been getting a lot of updates.

1426
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Pretty much a good regard to weak or something, right?

1427
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
I don't know.

1428
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Something I never really got into.

1429
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:14,000
One more.

1430
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Yeah!

1431
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
The core is neutralized.

1432
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Chain reaction is shutting down the other security element.

1433
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
We'll go over the salvage room.

1434
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
I think I got all three of the bonuses too.

1435
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Good work.

1436
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
What's this an EU friendly stream?

1437
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
It is.

1438
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
It's like afternoon plus three max hull?

1439
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Stand by for salvage teams.

1440
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Oh, okay. No, wait a minute.

1441
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
I guess I screwed that up.

1442
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Did that run?

1443
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Honestly, games like this that are very, very difficult.

1444
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
That require a ton of precision.

1445
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Like a huge amount of concentration.

1446
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,000
And a ton of bullet dodging.

1447
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
And my brain can't do it.

1448
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I get stuck in walls.

1449
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Oh, I overreact and bad shit happens to me.

1450
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I screw up one thing and then it's just a chain reaction.

1451
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
But I have an auto cannon now, so that's really amazing.

1452
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I'm gonna put it on here.

1453
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Really expensive.

1454
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Max load up 60K.

1455
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
I don't even care.

1456
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:38,000
I got a trench gun.

1457
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,000
No, stay with the machine gun for now.

1458
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I don't even actually know it.

1459
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Take the auto cannon off.

1460
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
It's unnecessary for right now.

1461
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
There's just too much money for it.

1462
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
It's like a level two place.

1463
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I don't need to do that.

1464
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
So let's instead put the blaster back on.

1465
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,000
I will take another heal this time though.

1466
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
No, I won't.

1467
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
I'm gonna take...

1468
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
I think I'm just gonna stay with that.

1469
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Maybe do I need a key?

1470
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Maybe.

1471
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Go right up here.

1472
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Drawing factories are huge deal.

1473
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
They just keep spawning enemies.

1474
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Can't do both dodging the plays pretty well in Isaac.

1475
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Isaac...

1476
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I don't know.

1477
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Isaac is a lot slower.

1478
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Right?

1479
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Isaac is a lot more deliberate and slower.

1480
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,000
The rooms are small and there's not a whole lot of things in the room.

1481
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
This game...

1482
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
And the games like Nuclear Throne and games that are in this kind of genre.

1483
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
There's so much stuff happening around you...

1484
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
that it is almost impossible to slow down and like sin know what you're doing.

1485
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Unless you have like really good lightning reaction speeds.

1486
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:03,000
That GPS wanted to take me in a really really awful direction.

1487
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,000
And plus I don't know if I like the team meet games.

1488
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Isaac Meat Boy.

1489
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
They're like very fun interesting games to me.

1490
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Where am I going here?

1491
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Down in here.

1492
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,000
I don't want to get rid of that yet.

1493
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,000
I'm scared to even touch that actually.

1494
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Oh shit!

1495
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Oh fuck!

1496
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
I forgot.

1497
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Where did it take me?

1498
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Hopefully not that far away.

1499
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
No, thank god it didn't put me somewhere else horrible.

1500
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Forgot when you blow up those things.

1501
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
They do that.

1502
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Is that affected by the alarm?

1503
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
No, I don't think so.

1504
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
But I'm on a mission.

1505
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
There we go.

1506
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
No!

1507
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Keep alarm systems.

1508
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
I hate the alarm systems.

1509
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
I despise them.

1510
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I'm just blowing them up.

1511
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
No supply pods.

1512
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I do want to take out these strong factories though.

1513
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
No supply pods.

1514
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
I can do that.

1515
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
He...

1516
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Stay away from that shit.

1517
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:15,000
I'm sorry I'm not looking at chat right now.

1518
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:19,000
This game requires you to be 100% of your attention.

1519
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
It's very good though.

1520
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
It's very good.

1521
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
And it's in early access.

1522
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Somehow this early access game feels like it's been done for a while.

1523
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
I don't need a key.

1524
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I don't want to be in the game.

1525
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
I'm not in the game.

1526
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
I can't.

1527
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
I can't.

1528
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
I can't.

1529
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
I can't.

1530
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
I can't.

1531
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I can't.

1532
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
I don't need a key.

1533
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
All right that's it.

1534
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
It's all the rest of it.

1535
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
I can actually cook the grenades.

1536
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
I don't know why I'm not doing that.

1537
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
We're boom.

1538
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Is the game free?

1539
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
The game is not free.

1540
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
I think it's like

1541
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
ten bucks.

1542
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
15, 10, 12 so I think it's on sale.

1543
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Initially here.

1544
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Burn out all resources.

1545
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Here they go.

1546
01:53:49,000 --> 01:54:00,000
You have your SATs today?

1547
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
What is it?

1548
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
What's a P at something like that?

1549
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
It's the original, the first one.

1550
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
The pre SATs.

1551
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I actually don't have frequently asked questions.

1552
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,000
I feel bad for people that are kind of just coming in here and being like, oh, what

1553
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
is this?

1554
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:27,000
I'm not a streamer yet.

1555
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
I'm kind of trying to.

1556
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I got money now.

1557
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Stay with the three.

1558
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
These are very hard.

1559
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Really last time when I streamed this game, I was doing the hard work.

1560
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:53,000
The hardest ones, I was going in with chain guns on every slot.

1561
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,000
It was really stupid.

1562
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,000
So I'm just going to stay nice and safe in my comfortable three.

1563
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
And eventually it's going to be five.

1564
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:09,000
But just to get past the first few areas, there's no reason, in my opinion, to blow money

1565
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:16,000
and waste it because you're trying to do like the extremely difficult ships.

1566
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
48,000 followers and he's just starting out.

1567
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Well, here's my streamer story.

1568
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Here's the tail of my stream.

1569
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I streamed, I've been doing YouTube and stuff.

1570
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:34,000
For those of you that I've just somehow found this channel and you have no idea what's

1571
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
going on.

1572
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
I do YouTube.

1573
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,000
I mostly do YouTube.

1574
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:46,000
And like four years ago, I live streamed, like maybe once or twice a week for a while.

1575
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,000
And then I stopped for two straight years.

1576
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:55,000
So like all these followers, I would say probably like 70% of the people that followed this

1577
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:00,000
stream, like four years ago, or like three years ago, that's where the majority of those

1578
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,000
followers came from.

1579
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Now I'm starting to start it back up again and get back into it a little bit, I guess

1580
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,000
you could say.

1581
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
So I do zip gun.

1582
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:20,000
I'm not going to go zip gun.

1583
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,000
I love this thing.

1584
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Zip gun will keep the blaster.

1585
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:33,000
But I get any different grenades, sticky grenades, they're more expensive.

1586
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,000
At 100k, can't max 100k.

1587
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:43,000
If I do another fixer, will that...

1588
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
That'll be 10.

1589
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:49,000
I could get rid of the blattin' all.

1590
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
I'll just stick with the regular grenades.

1591
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,000
That way I can stay on our 100k.

1592
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Do you think you've started a new channel on YouTube and no one knew who you were?

1593
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Could you become big again?

1594
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I don't know, man.

1595
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
It's a lot more difficult.

1596
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:11,000
If you want to start streaming or start doing YouTube or start getting into this kind

1597
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
of, like I guess you could call it, like a scene.

1598
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Back when I started five years ago, there weren't as many people doing it.

1599
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Then, you know, fast forward a few years.

1600
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
You go down, just go to like browse a random game on Twitch.

1601
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Even if you open up like one of the popular games, there are hundreds of potential channels,

1602
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,000
maybe even at some point, like in like the multiple hundreds and hundreds, maybe even

1603
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,000
like a thousand channels streaming in a really popular like Hammer Summler.

1604
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
At least hundreds.

1605
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
So it's hard to stand out.

1606
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Shit, it's got a cloaking device on it.

1607
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
That sucks.

1608
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Ah, sensor jammer.

1609
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Repair.

1610
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,000
What else we got?

1611
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,000
This is the most obnoxious.

1612
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,000
So that has to go.

1613
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:08,000
This kind of has to go.

1614
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
This has to go first.

1615
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Then this.

1616
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Then this.

1617
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
So we're going to go into here.

1618
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:21,000
I'm going to do, I don't think I even have the tech upgrade for the sensor.

1619
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I don't shit.

1620
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
This is going to be annoying.

1621
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I, this is really, really, really annoying.

1622
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
We're going to have to just go and blind.

1623
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I'm just going to make sure I don't die.

1624
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:39,000
I'm going to see if there's an entrance up here.

1625
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,000
If there's an entrance up here, I'm going to try to get rid of this even though it's

1626
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,000
being held by a repair.

1627
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:50,000
There is an entrance right here, but I don't want to trip the alarm.

1628
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Oh, it's not going to go.

1629
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Okay.

1630
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Back to being, it's terrible.

1631
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:06,000
It's dark in here.

1632
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Oh, come on.

1633
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:14,000
What am I just going to do?

1634
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
It's too dark.

1635
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I can't see anything.

1636
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
I've already taken way too much damage.

1637
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I don't have the key to get in there.

1638
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
I've already taken way too much damage.

1639
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I don't have the key to get in there.

1640
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Key right there.

1641
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Oh, shit.

1642
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Key.

1643
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:52,000
These drones, I've got to get rid of the drone factory.

1644
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I might be able to go a different way, but whatever.

1645
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:03,000
All right.

1646
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Now that I have a second here, sensor jammer has been deactivated.

1647
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I need to go here.

1648
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I need a key.

1649
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,000
That's a key right there.

1650
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
We're golden.

1651
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Let's go.

1652
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:23,000
There's a lot of shit on the screen right now.

1653
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:26,000
I can't see key right in here.

1654
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:33,000
I'll grab this.

1655
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Oh, my goodness.

1656
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,000
These people fucking playing.

1657
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:50,000
I hate these things.

1658
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
All right.

1659
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Now that we have that out of the way, I can get rid of the alarm system.

1660
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
I got your course.

1661
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I come back and I get hit.

1662
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
That sucked.

1663
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I got plenty of ammo.

1664
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:09,000
It'll be okay.

1665
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
That requires a key too.

1666
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Do I have a key right now?

1667
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
No, I don't.

1668
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I might just do this without, oh yeah.

1669
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Screw it.

1670
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Who cares about the alarm?

1671
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Destroy sentry systems and no supply pods.

1672
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Where are the sentry systems?

1673
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Way too far out of my way.

1674
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Yeah, we're just going to go without it.

1675
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,000
We're just going to get rid of the shield and just go right there and just trigger the

1676
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:40,000
alarm and hopefully we can destroy it fast enough.

1677
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Fuck.

1678
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:49,000
That's not cool.

1679
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:01,000
That means behind a locked door.

1680
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Using ammo, I didn't want to use.

1681
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Is this behind a locked door too?

1682
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Please tell me it isn't.

1683
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,000
It is.

1684
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Of course it is.

1685
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:31,000
It is a key right there.

1686
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
He had a way from me.

1687
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I saw you do that, you little shit.

1688
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,000
I just fucking hit myself with a grenade.

1689
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Be into impatient.

1690
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,000
I got to slow it down.

1691
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Be into impatient.

1692
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Let's get that key.

1693
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
There's so many things in that room.

1694
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,000
How much time do I have left?

1695
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Not a whole lot.

1696
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
I don't think there's any more really.

1697
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Now we're going to have to go just boss the wall.

1698
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Just going to have to go for it.

1699
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Run out of ammo too.

1700
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:21,000
So we're just going to go destroy it and hope I can just spam grenades at it.

1701
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Be able to win.

1702
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Anything in that room?

1703
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:45,000
No.

1704
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Wait for me.

1705
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Alright boys and girls.

1706
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:59,000
We're going for spam strats.

1707
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,000
That might have to clear this room a little though.

1708
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
There's so much shit.

1709
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Spam scratch.

1710
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Holy dog shit.

1711
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Oh my god.

1712
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
I don't know where I am.

1713
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Where am I?

1714
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
I don't know what happened.

1715
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
That holy fuck.

1716
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Did you see how much stuff was in that room?

1717
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:31,000
There were like four laser turrets on the walls.

1718
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
I actually did not.

1719
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,000
I saw the stuff.

1720
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Okay.

1721
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Well that was dumb.

1722
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Everything was behind a locked door and I didn't have any keys.

1723
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:45,000
That sucked.

1724
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:49,000
This time I'm going to look and see it because if like every single god damn door is locked,

1725
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
then I need to like bring a key.

1726
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:58,000
That was really fucking annoying.

1727
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Oh what's this?

1728
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:03,000
There is two locked doors in this whole place this time.

1729
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:08,000
And look I can just go.

1730
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Holy crap.

1731
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Are you shitting me?

1732
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Well that's what happens when you roll the dice on a procedurally generated game.

1733
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Sometimes every single door will be locked and sometimes the brain will be protected by the shield.

1734
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:31,000
That's literally 50 feet away from it.

1735
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:38,000
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

1736
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Look at this.

1737
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Oh guys, I better watch out for this locked door.

1738
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
How well I have a get in there.

1739
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Oh my heaven gonna get inside of that locked door.

1740
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Shit.

1741
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Alright enough complaining.

1742
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Let's play.

1743
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Oh let me make sure there's nothing in here.

1744
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:10,000
I don't care about that.

1745
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
I could just get.

1746
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Yeah, I'm just...

1747
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
We're just gonna do the same thing.

1748
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:19,000
There's no alarm system in this one either.

1749
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:23,000
This one should be fairly easy.

1750
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:33,000
If we've made that door to lock it was ship-faced.

1751
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:36,000
I'm just gonna do auto cannon.

1752
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Get the auto cannon and get in there and just blow it down.

1753
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,000
That sounds good.

1754
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I don't need any keys.

1755
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Right.

1756
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
There's all these doors are open.

1757
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Except for this one.

1758
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
I need one key.

1759
02:06:52,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Go in there and get the tech and then beat the level unlisted a minute.

1760
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
This game is cryptark.

1761
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
It's on steam right now.

1762
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,000
I'm not sure about if it's coming to consoles or not.

1763
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
I don't know.

1764
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
I really just don't have any idea.

1765
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:19,000
I wish I could TV that intel.

1766
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Oh shit.

1767
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Hold on.

1768
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Make sure I'm going the right way here.

1769
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Yeah, I am.

1770
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:41,000
There's no alarm system so I don't have to be worried about anything besides clearing this room.

1771
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I guess I could put this shield down.

1772
02:07:48,000 --> 02:08:00,000
God, those things are so horrible.

1773
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Those things do like two points of damage ahead.

1774
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
So brutal.

1775
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Okay, this one is okay now.

1776
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I'm just gonna do this.

1777
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Watch out guys.

1778
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Shit.

1779
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:17,000
What are we going to get rid of this?

1780
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Oh, that's a bad way to go.

1781
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Oh wow, holy fuck.

1782
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
I was wrong.

1783
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,000
I forgot that.

1784
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
I forgot it was not the one.

1785
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Okay, right.

1786
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:41,000
That's what I get for not paying attention to that.

1787
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Damn.

1788
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:55,000
At least there's no alarm system.

1789
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Put your shield down.

1790
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:10,000
There's a lot of these turrets in this one.

1791
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Unfortunately.

1792
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
I might actually get the...

1793
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Yeah, I'm going to get it.

1794
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I just totally forgot that.

1795
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Whatever was connected to what?

1796
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
So what was that shielding then?

1797
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:39,000
That's the question.

1798
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:55,000
This whole level is turrets.

1799
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Yikes.

1800
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:09,000
More locks.

1801
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:17,000
At least the ones that are connected do.

1802
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Kinetic buffer.

1803
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Never heard of that one.

1804
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:31,000
You are so annoying.

1805
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:34,000
You are very, very annoying.

1806
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Okay, so that will take that down.

1807
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
The ones that I have to destroy the flack and trolleys.

1808
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Oh, that's not a flack and trolleys.

1809
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Did I already get them all?

1810
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,000
I got all the flack and trolleys.

1811
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I don't need to do that.

1812
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:06,000
There's nothing protecting you, but wasn't what?

1813
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I'm kind of confused here.

1814
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:21,000
I'm confused.

1815
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:27,000
I don't have any more tech.

1816
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:32,000
I'm kind of running at a time, but whatever.

1817
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Whatever.

1818
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I could go into the nest.

1819
02:11:46,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Do you have to destroy everything?

1820
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:06,000
No, you don't.

1821
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
That's why I was confused.

1822
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Did I even take out another?

1823
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:11,000
I like to watch that part of the stream back.

1824
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Because I took out the shield and it was still shielded.

1825
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
But the thing that I destroyed up there, that wasn't a shield.

1826
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Was it?

1827
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Was the thing that I went up there, a shield?

1828
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
I don't know.

1829
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Apparently not.

1830
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Where am I going now?

1831
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:52,000
It was the redundancy building.

1832
02:12:52,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Potentially.

1833
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
A door lock system and something else.

1834
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I guess.

1835
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
I want to watch that part back.

1836
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
No idea.

1837
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:19,000
It was very odd.

1838
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Definitely keeping the auto cannon though.

1839
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:24,000
I wish I had a different machine.

1840
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:28,000
The current game is Victor Brand.

1841
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:41,000
It is not Victor Brand.

1842
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Nightbot, you really screwed this up.

1843
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:57,000
I need more ammo than that though.

1844
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,000
What's the max?

1845
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
A lot of 60k.

1846
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:02,000
I'm not going to be able to do that.

1847
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:07,000
This is the Victor Brand of the future.

1848
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:12,000
The current game is Victor Brand.

1849
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:17,000
This Victor Brand game sure looks fun.

1850
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
It really is.

1851
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I'm going to just stay.

1852
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Just try and true with the machine gun.

1853
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
It's just too good.

1854
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,000
The auto cannon.

1855
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,000
We're just going to stay with that.

1856
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:37,000
I also got a new laser.

1857
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:48,000
That's really expensive.

1858
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:59,000
I'm not going to do it.

1859
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:03,000
The repair station up here is a more than one reviewer.

1860
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:13,000
There are more than all these the worst.

1861
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:16,000
I have a Twitch partnership from like four years ago.

1862
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:19,000
So whatever the partnership was, four years ago,

1863
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:22,000
was the one that I have.

1864
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,000
When you have two repair stations, it sucks because you have to end up going in.

1865
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Both of these have to be destroyed.

1866
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:39,000
I'm going to have to go down.

1867
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
We're going to go down.

1868
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:44,000
There's a key.

1869
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,000
There's also one there.

1870
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,000
There's more locked doors everywhere.

1871
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:57,000
I picked the wrong one.

1872
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Does this guy really deserve to have his gaming license back?

1873
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:02,000
He's still going around using a faulty nightbot.

1874
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
I don't have it back.

1875
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:10,000
I have my learned experiment.

1876
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I'm going to go down.

1877
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,000
I got a key.

1878
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,000
There's a key right there I can take.

1879
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I'm going to destroy the two repair stations as we go.

1880
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Sounds good to me.

1881
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,000
How about it?

1882
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:33,000
I don't want to go that way.

1883
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:36,000
My GPS device is freaking out.

1884
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:39,000
I'm going to go all the way.

1885
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:43,000
This is going to be a long one.

1886
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:51,000
I don't know if I have faith in this one.

1887
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:59,000
It might not even be worth destroying that drone.

1888
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:06,000
I'm trying to destroy the facility just yet.

1889
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:13,000
I don't know how much time I'm going to have.

1890
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:28,000
If this two repair facilities, I'm going to have to haul ass after this is destroyed.

1891
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I've got to go.

1892
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:36,000
All ass.

1893
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Oh shit, that's the thing that blows up right?

1894
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
No, I don't want to go that way.

1895
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
It's a waste of key.

1896
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
You see what I'm saying?

1897
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
With two of those facilities going?

1898
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,000
It's hard to...

1899
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Yeah, it's going to come back.

1900
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:57,000
But at least they've got rid of some of those drones without being too much of a pain in the ass.

1901
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:02,000
I really wish you two weren't so annoying.

1902
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,000
I really wish you weren't that annoying.

1903
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:08,000
You just block in the way in.

1904
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:17,000
You chump get out of the way.

1905
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Oh my god.

1906
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:25,000
It's just getting repaired too.

1907
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
It's a tiny little rum.

1908
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Oh, that was horrible.

1909
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
I have to get rid of this other one.

1910
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

1911
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:44,000
All right, call me crazy.

1912
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
You can go ahead and call me crazy.

1913
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I'm going around the ship.

1914
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:57,000
I'm going to go around the damn ship and go in the not-so-hostile way.

1915
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
20%

1916
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
All right, which way?

1917
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Right in here and then down and around.

1918
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:11,000
I need to get that fucking key.

1919
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Right.

1920
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Is there a key right there?

1921
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Nope.

1922
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Where's the key?

1923
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Up there.

1924
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
How much time do I got?

1925
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:36,000
41%.

1926
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
No, what?

1927
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,000
No.

1928
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
What the hell?

1929
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Oh my god.

1930
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
What the fuck?

1931
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:48,000
I'm trying to open a door.

1932
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Refill ammo?

1933
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,000
No, I don't want to refill ammo.

1934
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Okay, well now just get destroyed because you didn't open the door and it-

1935
02:19:54,000 --> 02:20:02,000
I'm very, very angry.

1936
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:08,000
At least I got it.

1937
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Let's get rid of this.

1938
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Now we can take my time because now things aren't respawning every two seconds.

1939
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Get trolled.

1940
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:35,000
I actually am going to take this because I want the cannon.

1941
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:40,000
The cannon is just so amazing.

1942
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:44,000
That door is locked.

1943
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Is that stuck in there?

1944
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Can I not even go in that room?

1945
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Oh, I'm going to have to reroute this.

1946
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I can't get in there.

1947
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:02,000
Can I like cheese it and get it?

1948
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:07,000
No.

1949
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Holy shit.

1950
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:16,000
See you in hell.

1951
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Get out of my way.

1952
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,000
God.

1953
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:33,000
I really want to shut this alarm off.

1954
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:40,000
It's worth me doing the key.

1955
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,000
I will do this.

1956
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Don't want the alarm to go off because there are so many horrible things in that room down there.

1957
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:56,000
I would not want to get swarmed with everything.

1958
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:03,000
I would not want to get out of here.

1959
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:06,000
What are you doing in here?

1960
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
You're going to be a hero?

1961
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:16,000
I don't think so, dude.

1962
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Well, so if you'd like to know what happened right there, my game froze.

1963
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:26,000
I didn't move.

1964
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Now we're probably freezing.

1965
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,000
I think so.

1966
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:36,000
A little.

1967
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,000
I have to try and avoid all that for the game to freeze.

1968
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
And you can hit by the alarm.

1969
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:47,000
That's just fucking fantastic.

1970
02:22:53,000 --> 02:23:00,000
I need to look and see if there's one anywhere.

1971
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:04,000
There is, but it's all the way over there.

1972
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:11,000
I need to just sit in the corner and please game, please stop doing this.

1973
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:15,000
I'm going to like sit in this corner until this end.

1974
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Okay.

1975
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:21,000
No.

1976
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I should be able to get back though.

1977
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Come on, come on.

1978
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Okay.

1979
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:40,000
This is going to be very, very difficult to do this.

1980
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I'm running out of time, but even if you run out of time, you don't lose.

1981
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
But look at all the stuff that's in here.

1982
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:50,000
This was a terrible, terrible one.

1983
02:23:50,000 --> 02:24:02,000
I'm just going to just die because I want to restart the game.

1984
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:06,000
It's just for some reason is doing like stuttering all over the place.

1985
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Give me a second.

1986
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Give me one second.

1987
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:14,000
It saves my progress, don't worry.

1988
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Don't worry, my progress is saved.

1989
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Oh.

1990
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:32,000
How am I going to exit?

1991
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Like that.

1992
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Remember me and Star were talking about this the other day.

1993
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:53,000
This game is amazing except for when it does that.

1994
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Should be right here.

1995
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Oh, key, key.

1996
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Yeah, that's Grover.

1997
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:10,000
That's supposed to be good old Grover.

1998
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Yeah, that hold on screen was like 40 bucks.

1999
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:21,000
I paid myself 40 dollars.

2000
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:31,000
All right, are we good?

2001
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:32,000
I think so.

2002
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:35,000
I hope so.

2003
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:46,000
That's a real run killer.

2004
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Keep the alarm systems.

2005
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:55,000
I'm going to get up with the sticky zone.

2006
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
I like the sticky grenades a little bit better.

2007
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:03,000
I think I think.

2008
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Let's see what we got this time.

2009
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Oh, fuck, I love God.

2010
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,000
No.

2011
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Another one of these.

2012
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
I got to try to get rid of that.

2013
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Is there any repaired things?

2014
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Yeah, all the way down here.

2015
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
I'm going to go around this way.

2016
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
These have to go down first.

2017
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Otherwise buildings just come back.

2018
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Why don't you have a stream of normal USA times?

2019
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:46,000
That's like 7 a.m.

2020
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Because I'm trying to stay awake.

2021
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:57,000
I'm trying to reset my sleep schedule in a way.

2022
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Max 100k.

2023
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,000
What's my loadout right now?

2024
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,000
I'm 23.

2025
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:06,000
That's too much money.

2026
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Did I even need this key?

2027
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I guess I can't tell if I need the key because I can't save

2028
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
there are any locked doors.

2029
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,000
So we're going to keep it.

2030
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:21,000
There's only two throughout the sport.

2031
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:24,000
All right, well, I could try to keep...

2032
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I don't need to take a supply pot.

2033
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Keeping the alarm systems is a really awful risk human over.

2034
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:34,000
But especially when you can't see anything.

2035
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:38,000
And I don't have the upgrade to be able to see things to go through it.

2036
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:43,000
So we're going to try to get rid of the repair facility first.

2037
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I'm going to go down and around.

2038
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Where's my ship?

2039
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Up here.

2040
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:58,000
That would have checked out Victor Vran.

2041
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Hopefully there's an entryway down here.

2042
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:06,000
I think we've got those one literally right here.

2043
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:09,000
It would be amazing.

2044
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Yes, there is.

2045
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:17,000
But it's dark as hell.

2046
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:35,000
I think I had a key.

2047
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Just keep coming from every direction.

2048
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
And I don't know where to go.

2049
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:46,000
I did to get rid of that sensor, so bad.

2050
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:52,000
I just don't know the efficient way to move that way.

2051
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
There isn't alarm.

2052
02:28:54,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Don't get touched by that.

2053
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:23,000
I wish I had a better machine gun.

2054
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:30,000
I can't even tell what a wall is.

2055
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
That's really killing me.

2056
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,000
It's not having a machine gun.

2057
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:36,000
That's better like a heavy machine gun or something.

2058
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Hopefully I can go in here.

2059
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Please don't make it.

2060
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Looks like I have this in up.

2061
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Oh my goodness.

2062
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Oh my goodness.

2063
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:59,000
I can't go.

2064
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:10,000
I got to go up through here.

2065
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:13,000
God damn it.

2066
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Come on, give me like a sneaky back entrance.

2067
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:22,000
While I waste all this time looking for a how to move in this area.

2068
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Thank you.

2069
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Please let that be light.

2070
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:49,000
How old are you going away from me?

2071
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,000
You got no shield.

2072
02:30:52,000 --> 02:31:08,000
I need to second for the charge back up so I don't die.

2073
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Oh my brain.

2074
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Bullet hell.

2075
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Only the darkness wasn't consuming my body.

2076
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Oh I can see.

2077
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Oh we got to go down here.

2078
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Key key key key key.

2079
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:55,000
It'll be so safe if I go down that way.

2080
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:59,000
I love me a sneaky back entrance.

2081
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:05,000
There's a key here but I mean mine as well just go that way anyways.

2082
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:08,000
I just don't want to take unnecessary damage.

2083
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:12,000
I don't want to make heals left.

2084
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
I got 16 shots in the cannon.

2085
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:19,000
I'm not going to ammo.

2086
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Thankfully there's not a whole lot left.

2087
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:28,000
I'm going to be a lifod somewhere on the way.

2088
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:31,000
We're going to play it safe.

2089
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:35,000
I'm going to refill my ammo.

2090
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:38,000
I know it'll be a really really big deal later.

2091
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:45,000
I'm going to be really mad if I didn't get it.

2092
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Keep alarm systems.

2093
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Extra money I don't know if I want to do that.

2094
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:09,000
I have trouble enough as it is.

2095
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Quick shield.

2096
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:25,000
No is it worth it?

2097
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:32,000
No it's not.

2098
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Get rid of the alarm.

2099
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:42,000
The things that dash across the whole screen in less than a second make sure you get rid of those two.

2100
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Actually my put shield on a base button.

2101
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:05,000
I feel like that would be a lot easier rather than have to hold down right click.

2102
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:14,000
That guy is a smart guy.

2103
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Can't even walk into this room.

2104
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Dear Lord.

2105
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Open up.

2106
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
Oh boy.

2107
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Be really sneaky on this one.

2108
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Running out of health too.

2109
02:34:53,000 --> 02:35:01,000
That's a concern.

2110
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:05,000
I don't want you to come up behind me and shoot right in my spine.

2111
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:12,000
This is a busy ass room.

2112
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:19,000
I'm running into the negative side here.

2113
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Whoa getting stuck on shit.

2114
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:49,000
40 seconds into the time.

2115
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Damn.

2116
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:02,000
I'm going to lose money.

2117
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Running low on funds.

2118
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:13,000
Why am I called germa?

2119
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
My name is germi.

2120
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:21,000
That's it.

2121
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:24,000
This is where we lose.

2122
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:28,000
I only have 260,000.

2123
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:36,000
This is going to be extremely difficult and you know how I do when it comes to like extremely difficult things.

2124
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Maybe we'll see.

2125
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
What do we got there?

2126
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Let me look at the other ones.

2127
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Two repair ones.

2128
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:47,000
Forget this one.

2129
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Two alarms and two repairs.

2130
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:54,000
This one only has one alarm and one repair.

2131
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Look at all the stuff on this one.

2132
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Jeez.

2133
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Did you do that?

2134
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Yes.

2135
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:11,000
I'm the engineering in this game.

2136
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:23,000
I'm like the tutorial and I tell you all kinds of things and I teach you about how to play all that stuff.

2137
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Did you get my photo email?

2138
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,000
I did.

2139
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:29,000
I opened it up and I immediately closed it.

2140
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,000
You just dunk up my office dude.

2141
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Thanks.

2142
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Let's look at this.

2143
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Thankfully we don't have to deal with a sensor.

2144
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Seven minutes.

2145
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Shabba-beta.

2146
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Shabba-beta.

2147
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:50,000
I'll give you.

2148
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Only one repair which is good and it's right in the front door.

2149
02:37:56,000 --> 02:38:03,000
The juggernaut are a real huge issue if you're not taking out.

2150
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:09,000
I think we're just going to have to go slow here and take out like every single thing in this whole area.

2151
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:12,000
This whole part of the game here.

2152
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:24,000
We're going to go down with it and then we're going to go up with it and then we're going to go right out this door and the lamp am right into the core.

2153
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,000
No, we are not.

2154
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:26,000
We are not going to do that.

2155
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:32,000
We're going to go here first because that's a nuclear device which means in this tiny little cramped area if I destroy one of these,

2156
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:37,000
it makes a giant nuk explosion happen and we'll just kill you.

2157
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
So we're going to go up there first.

2158
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:42,000
Are there any more of those?

2159
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:45,000
No.

2160
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:48,000
So we got to go here.

2161
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Oh you know what?

2162
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,000
I could destroy this first and just get the hell out of here.

2163
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Come up here and then destroy that.

2164
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Which is, yeah that's what I'm going to do.

2165
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:00,000
That's a better idea.

2166
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
And then I won't be able to repair.

2167
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:05,000
I'm going to do that.

2168
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:06,000
This is Cryptarch.

2169
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Did you just joining us?

2170
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:13,000
The point of the game is that you make a loadout.

2171
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
You go and you destroy the cores.

2172
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
You have to destroy cores.

2173
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Everything's randomly, procedurally, procedurally generated.

2174
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:26,000
My mouse is lagging.

2175
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,000
What's that happening though?

2176
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:28,000
There we go.

2177
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,000
That was weird.

2178
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Everything's procedurally generated, which means you can get severely screwed.

2179
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Or you know, it could be like a walk in the park.

2180
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:43,000
This one shouldn't be too bad and I say that before we get going.

2181
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:50,000
We all know how stuff like that goes though.

2182
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Where I'm really taking a big hurt hit here.

2183
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
I'm not picking up enough tech upgrades.

2184
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:00,000
So I'm stuck with the medium machine guns.

2185
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Which really at this stage of the game, you need to be doing a lot more damage.

2186
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
And all I've picked up, I've gotten all the shotguns.

2187
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:13,000
But I'm not a fan of shotguns.

2188
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Unless it's like an assault shotgun.

2189
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:25,000
I do have this though, which is thankfully really, really good.

2190
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Quick shield is hard to use.

2191
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:30,000
So I don't want to use it in laser up.

2192
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:33,000
I'm tempted to try the laser, but I don't think I want to,

2193
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
because I want to try to like at least get to the Cryptarch.

2194
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Maybe if that's possible or at least get to like, I might just die here.

2195
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:43,000
This is going to be really hard probably.

2196
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:46,000
We're going to go with the zip gun though.

2197
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
No, we aren't.

2198
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:51,000
I need to save money.

2199
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:06,000
I'll stay with the 50.

2200
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Those are so necessary to destroy the big tanky things.

2201
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:14,000
I don't have two types of grenades, so they're staying.

2202
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:18,000
And I'll keep the 5-5 and a key.

2203
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Never know when you're going to need a key.

2204
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Except not this time, because there's no locked doors that I need to go into.

2205
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:29,000
If I go there up here, that's not locked.

2206
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:33,000
This is also not locked, and none of these are locked.

2207
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:38,000
So that key can kind of just go on the trash.

2208
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Save myself a few thousand Gs.

2209
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Oh.

2210
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
I like that sounds really cool.

2211
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:55,000
I shoot more and they're more accurate.

2212
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:56,000
15 grand.

2213
02:41:56,000 --> 02:42:03,000
Well, we kind of have to put all of our money in the pot anyways, because if I lose here, I pretty much lose the game.

2214
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Do you need good PC specs to run this?

2215
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
I don't think so.

2216
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:15,000
The only problem that this game has is like what happened last time is it's a very precise game that you need to be paying a lot of attention to.

2217
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:20,000
And sometimes the game will just hang, you know, with that typical like,

2218
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:25,000
or the game just kind of stops for like two seconds, and it will get you killed.

2219
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Even if that happens for like a quarter of a second, a game like this that requires like a quarter of a second reflexes,

2220
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:35,000
that like, it screw you up.

2221
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Then it happens in this game.

2222
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
But they're probably going to iron that out.

2223
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:44,000
It is early access, so they're, they're not sure they're doing all kind of bug fixes and stuff.

2224
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
It is a very, very, very fun game.

2225
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Extremely difficult, but very, very, very fun.

2226
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Let's stop talking about it.

2227
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Let's just show it.

2228
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Let's take a look, huh?

2229
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
Whoa.

2230
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
I don't think I've even seen the enemy before.

2231
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
It's like a reaper.

2232
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Fuckin' mine right after that.

2233
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Two mines.

2234
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:03,000
There's a room full of mines.

2235
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:04,000
That's what that was.

2236
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
A room full of mines.

2237
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Slow calm down.

2238
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Calm down.

2239
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:10,000
Great.

2240
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:15,000
Stickin' me in a room with eight mines in it in the front door.

2241
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Now I'm minus four health.

2242
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Now I got to be even more careful.

2243
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Alright, there's a tech up right up there.

2244
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Alarm Laura.

2245
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:53,000
I don't need that.

2246
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:54,000
I don't need that.

2247
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Shit.

2248
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Shit.

2249
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
That's the detonator, right?

2250
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:18,000
That's the juggernaut factory.

2251
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,000
I do not want to be killing that.

2252
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:22,000
I've got to go down and around.

2253
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
I'm going to go through the huge guy, right?

2254
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
Still going to go this way.

2255
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Okay, I got to go.

2256
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:35,000
Fuckin' mine.

2257
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Another mine.

2258
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Get out of the way.

2259
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Should've got that key.

2260
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Should've got that key.

2261
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Should've got that damn key.

2262
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Remember I said it didn't need a key?

2263
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Oh.

2264
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
At least it's gone.

2265
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:58,000
I feel like this is going to save Haven down here.

2266
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Mine.

2267
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Alright, this is a drone factory.

2268
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
It's going to do the explosion.

2269
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:12,000
I can actually outrun it if I go all the way up.

2270
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:13,000
I'm going to go for it.

2271
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
The parastation is dead.

2272
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:21,000
Let me get all the stuff that's down here that I need.

2273
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Rail cannon.

2274
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
I don't even know what that is.

2275
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Here comes a juggernaut.

2276
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
That's a dead end.

2277
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
You shitbag.

2278
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Okay.

2279
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Come down.

2280
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Let's go get rid of that thing up there.

2281
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:58,000
That will stop the buildings from exploding.

2282
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:02,000
Hopefully that would be great.

2283
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
There's no mines in the front door.

2284
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Inside the fucking ceiling then.

2285
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Something.

2286
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Oh my god, these mines are going to drive me crazy.

2287
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
You can't even see.

2288
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:34,000
I'd like to see.

2289
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
I'm not going to get that yet.

2290
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:44,000
There's a juggernaut in here.

2291
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:48,000
There's a juggernaut in here with me.

2292
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
There's two juggernauts.

2293
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Oh, you see?

2294
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:53,000
I'm going to get that.

2295
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
There's a juggernaut in here.

2296
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
There's a juggernaut in here with me.

2297
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:00,000
There's two juggernauts in here.

2298
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:03,000
Oh, what a mess.

2299
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
There's nowhere I can go.

2300
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
I have to get that repair.

2301
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
I got to get this.

2302
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:12,000
What?

2303
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
Jump dead.

2304
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
Yeah, I'm dead.

2305
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:19,000
Two juggernauts in a tiny little room with all these explosions.

2306
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Game over.

2307
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Holy shit, that was impossible.

2308
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Without any more ammo in that cannon by default machine gun.

2309
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,000
GG.

2310
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:34,000
There's no way I was beating that one.

2311
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
If you're curious, the juggernauts,

2312
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:39,000
they spawn every minute, I think, or every two minutes.

2313
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:44,000
If you don't destroy the juggernaut, towns.

2314
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
And they take...

2315
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:50,000
It's pretty much a giant tank that has explosions that shoot out of it.

2316
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
And they were just two things.

2317
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:55,000
They were two of them in that room.

2318
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:58,000
And there was no escaping them.

2319
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,000
The turret's all over the walls.

2320
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Shit.

2321
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Well, I lost.

2322
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Game over.

2323
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:15,000
There's a cryptarch.

2324
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:21,000
So I got to two before the cryptarch before I died.

2325
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:25,000
But that's the worst part, right?

2326
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:31,000
So there's like ten different building types in this game.

2327
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:34,000
They're all horrible, right?

2328
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
You have to pick your poison in this game.

2329
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:39,000
You either...

2330
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:42,000
For instance, those two juggernauts, the juggernaut stations,

2331
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
or whatever you want to call them.

2332
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
If I went and got those first,

2333
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:49,000
the nuclear explosion was still what happened.

2334
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:52,000
If you don't get the nuclear explosion,

2335
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
building destroyed,

2336
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:55,000
then you screw in...

2337
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Every way you're screwing yourself in this game.

2338
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:03,000
You have to pick which one you'd rather deal with.

2339
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
So, and you saw right there,

2340
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
I decided to try to get rid of the nukes,

2341
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:10,000
because they take up the whole screen.

2342
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
And I left the juggernaut stations,

2343
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
and then two of them were in the same room with me.

2344
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
And then you just die.

2345
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Because if there's that many in a small area

2346
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
you shoot the explosive fucking bombs.

2347
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
But yeah, that's Cryptarch.

2348
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
That did voice acting work for this game.

2349
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:29,000
It's really fun.

2350
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:32,000
It's just excruciatingly difficult.

2351
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
If you're into that sort of thing,

2352
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:37,000
I highly recommend it.

2353
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
You can...

2354
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:43,000
I would not recommend playing this game from bed.

2355
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Playing this game from bed would probably be a pretty bad idea.

2356
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
You might die.

2357
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
There are angels in the L field, bro.

2358
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
You gotta believe.

2359
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:05,000
Alright, let me switch to this for a second.

2360
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
I'm probably gonna do a video on it.

2361
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:15,000
I might do a video on this game.

2362
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Showing like the character that I'm doing and stuff.

2363
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Talk about it for a few minutes, maybe.

2364
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Alright, let's close out the stream with a little bit of...

2365
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
It's only $11, too.

2366
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Yeah, hold on, Grover, man.

2367
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
You gotta hold on one second.

2368
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:49,000
Cryptarch, very fun.

2369
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:52,000
It's just a very dice-roly.

2370
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:57,000
You saw some of those places that had almost every door was locked,

2371
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
and I didn't have enough keys.

2372
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:02,000
I kind of just had to run around like a chick with my head cut off.

2373
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
What the fuck is that?

2374
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:13,000
Did I get distracted just drive by my window?

2375
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Do some dude like a tractor just drove by?

2376
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Alright, I'm gonna...

2377
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
I'll close out the stream with a little bit of TF2.

2378
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Why not, right?

2379
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:49,000
I need to beat that Cryptarch, though.

2380
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:52,000
I will.

2381
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
I will beat the Cryptarch one day.

2382
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:11,000
You gotta change my stream title.

2383
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:12,000
Thanks for hanging out.

2384
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Those of you that are here.

2385
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
If it's early in the morning for you.

2386
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
Thanks for chilling.

2387
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Well, I try to reset my sleep schedule.

2388
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Thanks.

2389
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
Hold on a second.

2390
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
Okay.

2391
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:58,000
I may load up that game that we're talking about.

2392
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Fortress team.

2393
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
Does this mean no Euro streams when you reset the schedule?

2394
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:08,000
No.

2395
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Not necessarily.

2396
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
It just means that it's gonna be random times, you know.

2397
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:14,000
It might be two o'clock in the morning, it might be two p.m.

2398
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:15,000
I don't know.

2399
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:36,000
I'll change this.

2400
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Give me a second, guys.

2401
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:52,000
Dung!

2402
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:58,000
Or it is gonna go here.

2403
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:01,000
I don't need to play anything in particular.

2404
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
I'm just gonna unwind for a little bit.

2405
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:11,000
Just want to unwind.

2406
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,000
I know it's a black screen.

2407
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:26,000
I'm sorry.

2408
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
Sorry about the black screen.

2409
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Well, incoming Chrome, that sounds like a real big problem.

2410
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:49,000
You might want to call your local doctor's office and ask them what your course of action should probably be.

2411
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:03,000
Okay.

2412
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Okay.

2413
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:11,000
I'm just gonna be a demo night freak.

2414
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
Demo freak shot.

2415
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
That was a Windows 7 game.

2416
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:28,000
It was?

2417
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
I don't have Windows 7.

2418
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:35,000
I keep accidentally clicking on the Windows 10 thing.

2419
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
I don't want to do it.

2420
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:38,000
Not yet.

2421
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:42,000
And every time I go down to my taskbar, I end up accidentally having to sit through that loading screen.

2422
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:51,000
It's probably not a good idea to do this on this map.

2423
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:53,000
On offense.

2424
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
Full demo night?

2425
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
That's not a good idea.

2426
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:03,000
Oh god, the unlock of Beuser's demo night.

2427
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
How about we sit in forever?

2428
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:09,000
Let's go.

2429
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
I wish there was way you could speed up the setup time.

2430
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
Like, hold F and the speed up.

2431
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:14,000
It'll speed it up.

2432
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:19,000
It's far too spy.

2433
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
Sojour on this car, I think.

2434
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Yours by seem like you are.

2435
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Oh, that was bad.

2436
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
That just like shot me in the wrong direction.

2437
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
Yeah, I'm just doing this on wide.

2438
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
I'm just doing this to unzip.

2439
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:02,000
Maybe for like a 10 minutes, we could be like an hour.

2440
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
We'll find out, right?

2441
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
We'll find out, won't we?

2442
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
Can I bring in here?

2443
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:26,000
I'm always so scared to turn this corner because of right there.

2444
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
There's always a century there.

2445
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
We're way far ahead now.

2446
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Where the hell is red team?

2447
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
What's going on?

2448
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
We just moving together.

2449
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Is anybody on the other team?

2450
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Okay.

2451
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
Why would that far?

2452
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Like, I would that far ahead?

2453
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
I guess we were.

2454
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Yeah, it's moving.

2455
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Yeah, I was moving.

2456
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
I keep thinking that, dude, it's a spy.

2457
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
Every time.

2458
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:27,000
I don't know if we're just rolling them right now, but.

2459
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:31,000
I've seen like two people on red this whole time, and one of them was that viral.

2460
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:34,000
What the hell is that guy doing?

2461
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
This is...

2462
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Okay.

2463
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Uh.

2464
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
Watch out for this guy.

2465
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:52,000
He's got like arms.

2466
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:55,000
What is happening with this dude?

2467
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
He's got arms coming out of his back.

2468
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
He's got four arms.

2469
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:03,000
And he's about to stick that spy cycle in his own body.

2470
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
Uh.

2471
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:09,000
Let's go on red.

2472
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
This is what's happening.

2473
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:12,000
Okay.

2474
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:20,000
Holy shit.

2475
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:24,000
Is that two Flawg Pyro's?

2476
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
Is that guy for Chris?

2477
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:27,000
Okay.

2478
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
That's fine.

2479
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:38,000
I was doing the box trot, but the box is in showing.

2480
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
Time.

2481
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:49,000
Well, that was a crazy round, I guess.

2482
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:53,000
I saw three people on red team.

2483
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:59,000
And then I went to red team, and then I was locked in by Flawg Geistinator Pyro's.

2484
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
Stop distancing at once.

2485
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:04,000
Stop distancing at once.

2486
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
Oh, how childish.

2487
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:12,000
How childish I'm going to be dancing.

2488
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:19,000
Fucking childish.

2489
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:25,000
Flawg Pyro is the true evil in this game.

2490
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:28,000
And I wouldn't say that.

2491
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:37,000
So that's a is that a pyro and it's an engineer in a pyro isn't it?

2492
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:40,000
Who's two hands of those?

2493
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:43,000
Who's hands of those?

2494
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:46,000
That's a heavy in an engineer.

2495
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:49,000
Is it heavy in pyro?

2496
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:52,000
I forget all the default loadouts look like.

2497
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:55,000
Sorry, I'll get you next time.

2498
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:58,000
Oh.

2499
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:01,000
Oh.

2500
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:04,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

2501
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

2502
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:10,000
Oh.

2503
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:19,000
Hey, quick dancing man, there's like shit going on outside.

2504
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:23,000
Look, there's a battle going on.

2505
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
We're under attack by red team.

2506
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
There's no time to be dancing.

2507
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:36,000
Okay, well, you're over there.

2508
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:41,000
I'm as an engineer.

2509
03:01:57,000 --> 03:02:02,000
This is this part of blowing flames in my face.

2510
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:05,000
Okay.

2511
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:12,000
I wish I could hit a shot.

2512
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:16,000
That would be great.

2513
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
Oh, boy.

2514
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:21,000
I'm being surrounded.

2515
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:25,000
I'm going to try to stare at me.

2516
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:28,000
Are we going to try and do?

2517
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,000
Come on now.

2518
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:34,000
Here you go.

2519
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:37,000
I'm going to try to stare at me.

2520
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:40,000
Are we going to try and do?

2521
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:43,000
Come on now.

2522
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Here you go.

2523
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:49,000
Aha.

2524
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:54,000
Did I seriously get stabbed right in my face?

2525
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:57,000
I'm going to try to stare at me.

2526
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
Are we going to try and do?

2527
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:00,000
Come on now.

2528
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:03,000
Here you go.

2529
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:06,000
I'm trying to avoid that as best I could.

2530
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:09,000
It's still didn't work.

2531
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:13,000
Team Fortress 2.

2532
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:37,000
This time is right now.

2533
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:40,000
My brain is kind of on ice right now.

2534
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:43,000
I still haven't gone to bed.

2535
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:46,000
I still haven't gone to bed.

2536
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:50,000
I think I was just...

2537
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:54,000
I think I was just...

2538
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:58,000
I think I was just...

2539
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:06,000
Shit.

2540
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
I got to play something.

2541
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:11,000
What requires like zero brain power?

2542
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
Why didn't I go to bed last?

2543
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:22,000
I remember.

2544
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:25,000
I think it was like...

2545
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:30,000
3 or 4 a.m. yesterday, day before, whatever it was.

2546
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
I don't remember.

2547
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
Dude, it's like memento.

2548
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:37,000
I don't have like no memories.

2549
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:43,000
I have a sandwich, I don't think so.

2550
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:52,000
Oh shit.

2551
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:59,000
Oh shit.

2552
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:04,000
Hey, when life gives you lemons...

2553
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:08,000
Play heavy.

2554
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,000
You still alive.

2555
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:20,000
Maybe I'll take a knife in my face.

2556
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
Don't get me.

2557
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:30,000
Don't get me.

2558
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:42,000
Where did he go?

2559
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:49,000
There he is.

2560
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
Nobody's on the car.

2561
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:57,000
The car's all the way back there.

2562
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:01,000
What do you say?

2563
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:08,000
Do a triple chin-chair engee for the end of the stream.

2564
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:11,000
Do it again.

2565
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:14,000
Holy shit.

2566
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:15,000
Come on.

2567
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
Which one do you want?

2568
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:20,000
Which one?

2569
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:43,000
I don't want to punch that guy.

2570
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:55,000
I skipped school to watch this.

2571
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
Don't do that.

2572
03:06:57,000 --> 03:07:02,000
No, the stream's ending in like 10 minutes.

2573
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:06,000
I really hope that's a joke.

2574
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,000
Oh, here we go.

2575
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:09,000
I skipped school.

2576
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:10,000
Let's get out the popcorn.

2577
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
We're going to watch this live stream.

2578
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:15,000
He ended the stream.

2579
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:28,000
When that happens, just go to school and go with a tardy notice.

2580
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:31,000
I couldn't find my shoes.

2581
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
That's a good excuse.

2582
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:36,000
What teacher can argue that?

2583
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:39,000
Go to school late.

2584
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
Walk up to the front desk.

2585
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
Hey, I'm late.

2586
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:47,000
Okay, sweetie, why are you late?

2587
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:50,000
I couldn't find my shoes.

2588
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
Oh.

2589
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:55,000
Okay, well, you found them, obviously.

2590
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:56,000
You found them.

2591
03:07:56,000 --> 03:08:00,000
Yeah, I found them, but I couldn't find them before.

2592
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:04,000
Okay, well, please go to class.

2593
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:07,000
How are you going to argue that?

2594
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:10,000
What are you going to say to that?

2595
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:16,000
Okay, that's going to be right behind me.

2596
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:22,000
And he's second now.

2597
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:23,000
He's right next to me.

2598
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:24,000
I want to try to get the medic.

2599
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:27,000
I'm not going to be able to.

2600
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:33,000
I'm so paranoid of those two trying to shoot my own guys.

2601
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:44,000
Oh, stay heavy.

2602
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:45,000
Why not?

2603
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
I'm so tired at this point.

2604
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
I'm playing anything else.

2605
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:52,000
This is a bad idea.

2606
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:55,000
I'm a little bit of just walked the wrong way.

2607
03:08:55,000 --> 03:09:04,000
Hey, you!

2608
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:13,000
Coming for you.

2609
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
You saw the flash light?

2610
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:19,000
You saw the flash last night.

2611
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
The flash movie or the flash like TV?

2612
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:31,000
Isn't there a flash TV show?

2613
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
It's so close.

2614
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:37,000
Somebody get on it.

2615
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:52,000
Let's go this way.

2616
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:58,000
Oh shit.

2617
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:13,000
I'm going to skip my breakfast.

2618
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,000
I'm just going to punch a guy.

2619
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:24,000
I'm going to punch one guy and then I'm going to disconnect.

2620
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:26,000
What a punch that guy.

2621
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:27,000
I did hit him.

2622
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:39,000
I did punch him once.

2623
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:41,000
I'm going to punch this guy.

2624
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:45,000
Whoever comes out.

2625
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:51,000
They're going to get punched.

2626
03:10:51,000 --> 03:11:01,000
Nobody seems to be coming out of this way.

2627
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:08,000
Punch him.

2628
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:13,000
Punch this guy too.

2629
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:20,000
Give me one.

2630
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:22,000
Who is this guy?

2631
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:23,000
Sucks at Team Fortress.

2632
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:25,000
Does he even play 6s?

2633
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:26,000
No, I don't.

2634
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:27,000
I don't play 6s.

2635
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:40,000
Sorry.

2636
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:48,000
Huh!

2637
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:57,000
I've been awake for like 20-some odd hours now.

2638
03:11:57,000 --> 03:12:05,000
Anything that's time for me to go to bed or eat food and try to relax and do something?

2639
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:13,000
I want to stay up at least another few hours.

2640
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:20,000
Go to bed.

2641
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:31,000
I'm getting phone calls.

2642
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:38,000
I'm going to answer this call.

2643
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:47,000
I'll call back.

2644
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:52,000
It's pretty catchy ringtone.

2645
03:12:52,000 --> 03:13:01,000
I don't know how the fuck this is.

2646
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:02,000
Oh, alright.

2647
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:05,000
But I'm going to take off guys.

2648
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:08,000
This has been fun.

2649
03:13:08,000 --> 03:13:14,000
I'm going to go try to work on a video at some point later tonight.

2650
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:17,000
Maybe upload it tomorrow with the next day.

2651
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:19,000
We'll see.

2652
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:23,000
Yeah, I don't know if I'll complete me, boy.

03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:26,000
I got to the end there kind of and I just decided to play Cryptarch.

2654
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:31,000
And then got my ass kicked in Cryptarch, which is great.

2655
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:33,000
But yeah, thanks for coming guys.

2656
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:36,000
I love you.

2657
03:13:36,000 --> 03:13:38,000
Take it easy.

2658
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:45,000
Have a good one.
